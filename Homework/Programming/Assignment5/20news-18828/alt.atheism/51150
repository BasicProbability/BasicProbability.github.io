Perhaps we shouldnt imprision people if we could watch them closely
instead  The cost would probably be similar especially if we just
implanted some sort of electronic device
Why wait until they commit the crime  Why not implant such devices in
potential criminals like Communists and atheists

Sorry I dont follow your reasoning  You are proposing to punish people
before they commit a crime  What justification do you have for this
