Ive said enough times that there is no alternative that should think you
might have caught on by now  And there is no alternative but the point
is rationality isnt an alternative either  The problems of metaphysical
and religious knowledge are unsolvable or I should say humans cannot
solve them

How does that saying go Those who say it cant be done shouldnt interrupt
those who are doing it
