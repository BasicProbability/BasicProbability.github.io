 How long does it the motto have to stay around before it becomes the
 default    Wheres the cutoff point 
 I dont know where the exact cutoff is but it is at least after a few
 years and surely after 40 years
 Why does the notion of default not take into account changes
 in population makeup     
 
 Specifically which changes are you talking about  Are you arguing
 that the motto is interpreted as offensive by a larger portion of the
 population now than 40 years ago

No do I have to    Im just commenting that it makes very
little sense to consider everything we inherit to be the default

Seen any steam trains recently
