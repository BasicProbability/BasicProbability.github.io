 Should we British go around blowing up skyscrapers next
 
 I dont know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying 
 1 that the person accused of blowing up the WTC in NY actually did it
 and
 2 that Islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the WTC

I was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa
against Rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally
insulting 

I think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long
posting and to say 

	I dont know if you are doing so but it 
	seems you are implying

is at the very best quite disingenuous and perhaps even
dishonest    If anyone care to dig back and read the full
posting they will see nothing of the kind

I trust you dont deny that Islamic teaching has something
to do with the fatwa against Rushdie
