Subject Re An Anecdote about Islam

In article 114127buedu jaegerbuphybuedu Gregg Jaeger writes
 
 I dont understand the point of this petty sarcasm It is a basic 
 principle of Islam that if one is born muslim or one says I testify
 that there is no god but God and Mohammad is a prophet of God that
 so long as one does not explicitly reject Islam by word then one must
 be considered muslim by all muslims So the phenomenon youre attempting
 to make into a general rule or psychology is a direct odds with basic
 Islamic principles If you want to attack Islam you could do better than
 than to argue against something that Islam explicitly contradicts

Then Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing
bad acts people temporarily become atheists
