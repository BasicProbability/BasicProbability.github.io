Someone writes
I found a list of Biblical contradictions and cleaned it up a bit
but now Id like some help with it

Im curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve

Its about time  Why do atheists spend so much time paying attention
to the bible anyway

Face it there are better things to do with your life  I used to
chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity
of people believing in it as truth etc  Why do we spend so little
time on the Mayan religion or the Native Americans  Heck the Native
Americans have signifigantly more interesting myths  Also what
about the Egyptians

I think we pay so much attention to Christianity because we accept
it as a religion and not a mythology which I find more accurate


I try to be tolerant  It gets very hard when someone places a book
under my nose and tells me its special  Its not
