 The automobile system kills nondriving passengers not to mention
 pedestrians  You need not drive or even use a car to be killed by one
 
 Indeed and it kills far more than a system of public transport would  I am
 therefore entirely in favour of banning private cars and replacing them with
 trains buses taxis bicycles and so on

Seconded   I cycle to work each day and if we could just get
those damned cars and their cretinous drivers off the road it
would be a lot more fun
