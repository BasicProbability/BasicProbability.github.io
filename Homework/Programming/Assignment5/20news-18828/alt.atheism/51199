But God created Lucifer with a perfect nature and gave him along with
the other angels free moral will

Now God could have prevented Lucifers fall by taking away his ability
to choose between moral alternatives worship God or worship himself

So Lucifers moral choices are determined by his will
What determines what his will is

A few posts ago you said that Lucifer had no free will  From the above
it seems the JW believes the contrary

Are you talking about the same Lucifer

If so can you suggest an experiment to determine which of you is wrong

Or do you claim that you are both right
