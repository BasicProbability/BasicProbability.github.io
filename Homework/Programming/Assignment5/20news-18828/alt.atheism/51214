 So you consider the german posters remark antisemitic 

When someone says

	So after 1000 years of sightseeing and roaming around its 
	ok to come back kill Palastinians and get their land back 
	right

Yes thats casual antisemitism    I can think of plenty of ways
to criticize Israeli policy without insulting Jews or Jewish history

Cant you
