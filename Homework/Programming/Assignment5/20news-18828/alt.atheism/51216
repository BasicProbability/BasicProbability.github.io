 I wouldnt consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic 
 TM viewpoint though  For all we know the prophets cousin and
 the Fourth Khalif Hazreti Ali may have said this after a 
 frustrating night with a woman

Thats very interesting    I wonder are womens reactions
recorded after a frustrating night with a man   Is that
considered to be important
