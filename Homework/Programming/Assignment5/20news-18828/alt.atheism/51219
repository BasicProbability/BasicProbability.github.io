The corrupted over and over theory is pretty weak  Comparison of the
current hebrew text with old versions and translations shows that the text
has in fact changed very little over a space of some two millennia  This
shouldnt be all that suprising people who believe in a text in this manner
are likely to makes some pains to make good copies

C Wingate         The peace of God it is no peace
                      but strife closed in the sod
mangoecsumdedu   Yet brothers pray for but one thing
tovemangoe           the marvlous peace of God
