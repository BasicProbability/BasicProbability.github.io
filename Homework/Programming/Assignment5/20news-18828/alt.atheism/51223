My syllogism is of the form
A is B
C is A
Therefore C is B
 
This is a logically valid construction
 
Your syllogism however is of the form
A is B
C is B
Therefore C is A
 
Therefore yours is a logically invalid construction 
and your comments dont apply

If all of those are iss of identity both syllogisms are valid
If however B is a predicate then the second syllogism is invalid
The first syllogism as you have pointed out is validwhether B
is a predicate or designates an individual
