PMy atheism is incidental and the question of God is trivial
P
PBut
P
PIt matters a great deal to me when idiots try to force their belief on me
Pwhen they try to enforce their creation myths to be taught as scientific
Pfact in school when they tell me I can have no morals because morals are
Pfrom God when a successful presidential candidate says that an atheist
Pshouldnt be considered a citizen and couldnt be patriotic because after
Pall this is one nation under God when the fundies try to take over the
Pparty that may well provide the next President of The United States of
PAmerica so that they can force their beliefs on the rest of the country
Pet cetera
P
PThats why I subscribe to altatheism
P
PAnd in the middle of this people who arent mind readers pop up on
Paltatheism to tell me what I do or dont believe or to concoct some
Pstrawman reason why I dont share their particular belief
P
PYou think I should just accept this
P
PThis isnt particularly a dig at fundamentalist christians I have been
Ptold on altatheism that I reject Allah because I am too proud to embrace
Pislam and that I reject Krishna because my eyes are closed But most of
Pthe religious nuts who post on altatheism are some kind of militant
Pchristian who cant accept that others dont share their beliefs This
Pkind of stuff should be kept on talkreligionmisc where it belongs
P
PATHEISM ISNT A BELIEF ITS THE ABSENCE OF BELIEF IN ANY GODS
P                                 
P
PDo you have a problem with this
P
P
PBill
PFirst I would like to say that atheism is in fact a belief  It is a beilief
Pbecause a belief in something you hold to with ador and faith  An atheist says there are no gods  This cannot be proven therefore you are excepting this on
Pfaith alone  That is a belief  Secondly you complain so much about how the 
Pfundamental christians are trying to force their beliefs on you but you dont
Pmention anything about how the atheists such as Madamme Murry Oharefounder
Pof the Atheists Association in Austin Texas and Robert Shermanfrom the       Chicago area have been trying to force their beliefs on everyone by trying to  get rid of God from our society by banning religious paintings from parks during Chistmas  forcing cities to change their town seals if there is any mention of God in it like Sherman has done or trying to get the slogan In God We Trust off of the American currency You also talk about creation myths as if they are in fact myths and tha
P
P
P 
Phave concrete evidece of this  You probably
Pdont and that just enforces my point that your atheism is just as much belief as my christianity  If this is not so please do show me why it isnt  
PMark Covalt 

The only real problem I have with the argument of christianity is that they seem to ignore their origin that being Asiatic in origin  As soon as christians become the 
good non egocentric Buddhists they are supposed to be then I might listen

My opinion I speak not for my place of employment But I should
Christ was overrated and will the ATF follow Koresh the current Christ through
his ascention to heaven
