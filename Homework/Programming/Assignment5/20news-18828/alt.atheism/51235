I was looking for a rigorous definition because otherwise we would be
spending the rest of our lives arguing what a Christian really
believes

I dont think we need to argue about this

KSDo you think that the motto points out that this country is proud
KSof its freedom of religion and that this is something that
KSdistinguishes us from many other countries
MWNo
KSWell your opinion is not shared by most people I gather
Perhaps not but that is because those seeking to make government
recognize Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do not
think they are infringing on the rights of others who do not share
their beliefs

Yes but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize
Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think
the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their
beliefs

And actually I think that the government already does recognize that
Christianity is the dominant religion in this country  I mean it is
Dont you realizerecognize this

This isnt to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of
Christianity just that most people do

Like Ive said before I personally dont think the motto is a major
concern

If you agree with me then what are we discussing

KSSince most people dont seem to associate Christmas with Jesus much
KSanymore I dont see what the problem is
Can you prove your assertion that most people in the US dont
associate Christmas with Jesus anymore

No but I hear quite a bit about Christmas and little if anything about
Jesus  Wouldnt this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really
associated to a high degree with him  Or are you saying that the
association with Jesus is on a personal level and that everyone thinks
about it but just never talks about it

That is can you prove that most people do associate Christmas
most importantly with Jesus

Anyways the point again is that there are people who do associate
Christmas with Jesus It doesnt matter if these people are a majority
or not

I think the numbers do matter  It takes a majority or at least a
majority of those in power to discriminate  Doesnt it
