 I think you mean circular not recursive but that is semantics
 Recursiveness has no problems it is just horribly inefficient just ask
 any assembly programmer

Tailrecursive functions in Scheme are at least as efficient as iterative
loops  Anyone who doesnt program in assembler will have heard of optimizing
compilers
