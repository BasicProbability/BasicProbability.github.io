From mangoecsumdedu Charley Wingate
Subject Re A visit from the Jehovahs Witnesses good grief

The amount of energy being spent on ONE LOUSY SYLLOGISM says volumes for the
true position of reason in this group
 
C Wingate         The peace of God it is no peace
                      but strife closed in the sod
mangoecsumdedu   Yet brothers pray for but one thing
tovemangoe           the marvlous peace of God
