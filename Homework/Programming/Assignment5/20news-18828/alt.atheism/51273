My personal objection is that I find capital punishment to be
cruel and unusual punishment under all circumstances

It can be painless so it isnt cruel  And it has occurred frequently
since the dawn of time so it is hardly unusual

I dont take issue with the numbers  A single innocent life taken
is one too many

But innocents die due to many causes  Why have you singled out
accidental or false execution as the one to take issue with
