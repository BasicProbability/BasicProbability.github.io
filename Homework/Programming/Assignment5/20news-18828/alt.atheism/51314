 And thank the Lord that Bill Connor has returned to set
 us straight  Now I know I can die happy when my Lexus
 SE400 wipes out on that rainslick curve in 1997  The
 rest of you had best straighten up because your time 
 is even more limited  Most of you are going in the Flu
 of 1994

You know youre glad to have me visit
