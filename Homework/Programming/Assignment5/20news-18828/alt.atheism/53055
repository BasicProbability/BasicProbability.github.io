	These Biblelovers have got to chill out  If we all could just relax
and see atheism for what it is the funny pages could have more material

	Atheism denies the existence of God  This is logically bankrupt 
where is the proof of this nonexistence  Its a joke

	So nobody can take the above sense of atheism seriously  Perhaps

Perhaps because you just made it up

Now put your skateboard away and read the FAQ  Learn something about atheism
before you get off on these tangents
