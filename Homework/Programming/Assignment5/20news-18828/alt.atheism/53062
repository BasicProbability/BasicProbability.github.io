Subject Re KORESH IS GOD

FROM   mathew mathewmantiscouk
The latest news seems to be that Koresh will give himself up once hes
finished writing a sequel to the Bible

In article 29440799951p00261psilinkcom Robert Knowles p00261psilinkcom writes
Writing the Seven Seals or something along those lines  Hes already
written the first of the Seven which was around 30 pages or so and has
handed it over to an assistant for PROOFREADING  I would expect any
decent messiah to have a builtin spellchecker  Maybe Koresh 20 will
come with one

I heard he had asked the FBI to provide him with a word processor  Does
anyone know if Koresh has requested that it be WordPerfect50  WP50 was
written and is owned by Mormons so the theological implications of
requesting or refusing WP50 are profound
