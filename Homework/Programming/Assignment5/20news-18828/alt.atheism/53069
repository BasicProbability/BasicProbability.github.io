Rule 4  Dont mix apples with oranges  How can you say that the
extermination by the Mongols was worse than Stalin  Khan conquered people
unsympathetic to his cause  That was atrocious  But Stalin killed millions of
his own people who loved and worshipped him and his atheist state  How can
anyone be worse than that

Youre right  And David Koresh claimed to be a Christian
