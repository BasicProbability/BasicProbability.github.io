This is the reason I like the controversy of postmodernism the
issues of polarities  evil and good  are just artificial 
constructs and they fall apart during a closer inspection

The more I look into the notion of a constant struggle between
the evil and good forces the more it sounds like a metaphor
that people just assume without closer inspection


  More info please  Im not well exposed to these ideas
