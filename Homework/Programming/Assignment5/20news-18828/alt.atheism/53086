      you might think oh yeah then why didnt god destroy it in the bud 
 before it got to the point it is nowwith millions through the 
 ages suffering along in life
       the only answer i know is that satan made the claim that his way was 
 better than Gods  God is allowing satan the chance to prove that his way 
 is better than Gods  we all know what that has brought     
 
 Come on  God is allowing the wishes of one individual to supercede the
 wellbeing of billions  I seriously doubt it  Having read the Bible
 twice I never got the impression that God and Satan were working in some
 sort of cooperative arrangement
 
 Read the book of Job
 

Oh that was just a bet
