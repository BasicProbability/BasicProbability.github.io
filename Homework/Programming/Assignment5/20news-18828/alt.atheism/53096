 Anyhow on the basis of the apparent success of Islamic banks it seems
 to me that the statement that a zerointerest economy cannot survive in

Im sure zerointested economical systems survive on a smallscale
coops is not an Islamic invention and we have cooperatives working
all around the world However such systems dont stand the corruption
of a large scale operation Actually nothing could handle human
greed IMHO Not even Allah
