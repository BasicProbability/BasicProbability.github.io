 You are amazed that I find it difficult to grasp it when
 people justify deaththreats against Rushdie with the 
 claim he was born Muslim
 
 This is empty rhetoric I am amazed at your inability to understand what
 I am saying not that you find it difficult to grasp it when people
 justify deaththreats I find it amazing that your ability to
 consider abstract questions in isolation You seem to believe in the
 falsity of principles by the consequence of their abuse You must hate
 physics

Youre closer than you might imagine   I certainly despised living
under the Soviet regime when it purported to organize society according
to what they fondly imagined to be the objective conclusions of
Marxist dialectic

But I dont hate Physics so long as some clown doesnt start trying
to control my life on the assumption that we are all interchangeable
atoms rather than individual human beings
