Subject Re Morality was Re Political Atheists

kcochrannyxcsduedu Keith Justified And Ancient Cochran writes

So you are saying that it isnt possible for an instinctive act
to be moral one  That is in order for an act to be an act of morality
the person must consider the immoral action but then disregard it
No Im saying that in order for an act to be moral or immoral somebody
someonesomething must consider it to be so  That implies intelligence
not instinct

Who has to consider it  The being that does the action  Im still
not sure I know what you are trying to say
