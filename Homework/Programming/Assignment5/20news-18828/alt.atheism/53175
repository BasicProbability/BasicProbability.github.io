Subject Re  was Re Cruel was Re Political Atheists

sdoenmsuedu Stephen Doe writes

Of course if at some later time we think that the death penalty
is cruel or unusual it will be outlawed  But at the present
most people dont seem to think this way
This from the same fellow who speaks of an objective or natural
morality  I suppose that if the majority decides slavery is OK then
it is no longer immoral

I did not claim that our system was objective
