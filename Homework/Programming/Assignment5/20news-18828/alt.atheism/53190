 I hope an Islamic Bank is something other than BCCI which
 ripped off so many small depositors among the Muslim
 community in the Uk and elsewhere

 Grow up childish propagandist

Gregg Im really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice
things arent quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim
them to be upsets you but exactly who is being childish here is 
open to question

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank 
what will someone bet me they werent real Islamic owners and
operators  and yet it actually turned out to be a longrunning
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors

And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
BCCI rather than the nasty interestmotivated western bank down
the street   Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned 
and operated bank couldnt possibly cheat them 

So please dont try to con us into thinking that it will all 
work out right next time
