No thats just what you thought the theory meant  While all humans
are generally capable of overpowering their instincts it does not
follow that those who do this often are necessarily more intelligent
Ok so why arent animals generally capable of overpowering their instincts

Good question  Im sure some biologist could answer better than I
but animals brains are just set up differently

Animals can be trained but if theyre instincts serve them well there is
no reason to contradict them
