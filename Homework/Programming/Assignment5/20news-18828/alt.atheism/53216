The little things above were in reference to Germany clearly  People
said that there were similar things in Germany but no one could name any
Thats not true  I gave you two examples  One was the rather
pevasive antisemitism in German Christianity well before Hitler
arrived  The other was the system of social ranks that were used
in Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest 
of the population

These dont seem like little things to me  At least they are orders
worse than the motto  Do you think that the motto is a little thing
that will lead to worse things
