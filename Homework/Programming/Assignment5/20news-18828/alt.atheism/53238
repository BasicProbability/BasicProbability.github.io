Subject Re The Inimitable Rushdie Re An Anecdote about Islam

In article 115288buedu jaegerbuphybuedu Gregg Jaeger writes

Hed have to be precise about is rejection of God and his leaving Islam
One is perfectly free to be muslim and to doubt and question the
existence of God so long as one does not reject God I am sure that
Rushdie has be now made his atheism clear in front of a sufficient 
number of proper witnesses The question in regard to the legal issue
is his status at the time the crime was committed 


Id have to say that I have a problem with any organization 
religious or not where the idea that simple speech such
as this is the basis for a crime
