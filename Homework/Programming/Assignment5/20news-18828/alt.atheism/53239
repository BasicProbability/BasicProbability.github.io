Hed have to be precise about is rejection of God and his leaving Islam
One is perfectly free to be muslim and to doubt and question the
existence of God so long as one does not reject God I am sure that
Rushdie has be now made his atheism clear in front of a sufficient 
number of proper witnesses The question in regard to the legal issue
is his status at the time the crime was committed 


Ill also add that it is impossible to actually tell when one
rejects god  Therefore you choose to punish only those who
talk about it
