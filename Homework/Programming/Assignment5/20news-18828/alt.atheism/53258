From mangoecsumdedu Charley Wingate
Subject Re Origins of the bible

Adda Wainwright writes

He stated that thousands of bibles were discovered at a certain point in
time which were syllableperfect  This therefore meant that there must have
been one copy at a certain time the time quoted by my acquaintance was
approximately 50 years after the death of Jesus

This is as far as I know complete nonsense  The codification of the bible
as we have it now came very much later
 
C Wingate         The peace of God it is no peace
                      but strife closed in the sod
mangoecsumdedu   Yet brothers pray for but one thing
tovemangoe           the marvlous peace of God
