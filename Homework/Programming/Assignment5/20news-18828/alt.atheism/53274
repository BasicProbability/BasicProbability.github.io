In article C5qGM3DL8newscsouiucedu cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb writes
Merely a question for the basis of morality

MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior

I disagree with these  What society thinks should be irrelevant  What the
individual decides is all that is important


1Who is society

I think this is fairly obvious


2How do they define what is acceptable

Generally by what they feel is right which is the most idiotic policy I can
think of


3How do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position

By thinking for ourselves
