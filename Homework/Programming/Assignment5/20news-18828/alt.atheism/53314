Subject Re free moral agency

 Are you saying that their was a physical Adam and Eve and that all
 humans are direct decendents of only these two human beings  Then who
 were Cain and Ables wives  Couldnt be their sisters because AE
 didnt have daughters  Were they nonhumans

Genesis 54

and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years and
he begat sons and daughters
