Subject Re Amusing atheists and agnostics

In article 1qsum1INNg5kshelleyuwashingtonedu jimhcarsonuwashingtonedu James Hogan writes

I think youve missed the point  Take altatheism for instance
Its an exponentbased anagram  When fully extended it translates
to
     Dig Tunnels Deep
     Store Grain Everywhere
     Prepare for the Coming Struggle

Youll no doubt recognize this as a quote from Chairman Mao

Thus I think youll have to admit that  atheists have a lot 
more up their sleeve than you might have suspected 

Agnostics will be sent to the gulag under the Maoatheist new order

Now where did I put my little red book  Or was that green

If God is dead and the actor plays his part                      Sting
His words of fear will find their way to a place in your heart  History
Without the voice of reason every faith is its own curse        Will Teach Us
Without freedom from the past things can only get worse         Nothing
