Subject Re Where are they now

Perhaps its prophetic that the week Where are they now appears and
I can claim to be a stillactive oldtimer my news software gets bit
rot and ships outgoing articles into a deep hole somewhere  Anyway
heres a repost

In article 1qi156INNf9nsenatorbedfellowMITEDU tcbrunoathenamitedu Tom Bruno writes

Which brings me to the point of my posting  How many people out there have 
been around altatheism since 1990  Ive done my damnedest to stay on top of
the newsgroup but when you fall behind you REALLY fall behind 

These days you dont have to fall far behind Last Monday
admittedly after a long weekend but I had 800 messages just in
those few days  Aside from a hiatus while changing jobs last Fall
Ive been here since 1990

Has anyone tried to
keep up with the deluge  Inquiring minds want to know  Also does anyone
keep track of where the more infamous posters to altatheism end up once they
leave the newsgroup  Just curious I guess

Hell Norway  The rubber room at the funny farm  Seminary  It is
not given to us to know
