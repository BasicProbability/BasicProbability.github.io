Another issue is that by having to request to not be required to
recite the so help me God part of the oath a theistic jury may be
prejudiced against your testimony even though atheism is probably not
at all relevant to the case

What is the recommended procedure for requesting an alternate oath or
affirmation

Dave

Sorry for using a followup to respond but my server dropped about a weeks worth of news
when it couldnt keep up

When the you are asked to swear So help you god and you have to say it ask which one Jesus
Allah Vishnu Zues Odin  Get them to be specific   Dont be obnoxious just humbly ask then 
quitely sit back and watch the fun
