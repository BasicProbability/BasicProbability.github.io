 Which brings me to the point of my posting  How many people out there have 
 been around altatheism since 1990  Ive done my damnedest to stay on top of
more stuff deleted

Hmm USENET got its collective hooks into me around 1987 or so right after I
switched to engineering  Id say I started reading altatheism around 198889
Ive probably not posted more than 50 messages in the time since then though
Ill never understand how people can find the time to write so much  I
can barely keep up as it is
