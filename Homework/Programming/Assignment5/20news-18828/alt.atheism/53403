I always thought that the Pope was a bear

You know because of that little saying

Does a bear shit in the woods
Is the Pope Catholic

There MUST be SOME connection between those two lines

And I always heard it

Is the bear Catholic
Does the pope 

Oh nevermind

Anyone from Alabama knows it should be

Is The Bear Catholic
Does a Pope shit in the woods

The Pope may not be a bear but The Bear is a god
