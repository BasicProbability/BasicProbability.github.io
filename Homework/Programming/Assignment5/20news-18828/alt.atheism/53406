While were on the topic of books has anyone else noticed that Paines
The Age of Reason is hard to find  Ive been wanting to pick up
a copy for a while but not bad enough to mail order it  Ive noticed
though that none of the bookstores I go to seem to carry it  I thought
this was supposed to be classic  Whats the deal


  Me too  Our local used book store is the second largest on the
  West Coast and I couldnt find a copy there  I guess atheists
  hold their bibles in as much esteem as the theists
