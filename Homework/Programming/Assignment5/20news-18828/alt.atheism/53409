 My understanding is that UK blasphemy laws yes they exist in the UK
 although they are littleused apply only to Anglican Christianity
 
 How does this fit in with your claim that there is no state religion in 
 the UK

Why dont you ask the approx two million British Muslims who break
it five times a day and have never ever been prosecuted under it

Then ask how easy it is to hold a Christian church service in Saudi
Arabia
