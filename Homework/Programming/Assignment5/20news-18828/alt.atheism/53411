   Lets say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
 towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
 excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has further to
 travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of   
 infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

Not true Only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole
will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon In the
particles own reference frame it takes a very finite time to reach the
horizon and the singularity The math does indeed predict this Take a look
at Mitchner Thorne and Wheelers Gravitation

Dont forget to sing
            They say theres a heaven for those who will wait
                Some say its better but I say it aint
        Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
                     The sinners are much more fun
                         Only the good die young
