  They spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the Constitution 
 
 I realise that this is widely held belief in America but in fact
 the clause on cruel and unusual punishments like a lot of the
 rest was lifted from the English Bill of Rights of 1689
 
 According to Jerry Manders In the Absence of the Sacred good
 book BTW the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
 also played a significant role as a model for the US Constitution
 Furthermore apparently Marx and Engels were strongly influenced
 by a study of Iroquois society using it as the prime example of
 a successful classless egalitarian noncoercive society  Mander
 goes on to say that both the US and the USSR would do well
 to study the original document figure out where each went wrong
 and try to get it right next time

Thats fascinating   I heard that the Chinese rather than
the Italians invented pasta
