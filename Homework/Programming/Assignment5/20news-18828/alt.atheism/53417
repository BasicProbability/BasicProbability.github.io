  Well chimps must have some system  They live in social groups
  as we do so they must have some laws dictating undesired behavior
 
 Ah the verb to must   I was warned about that one back
 in Kindergarten
 
 So why must they have such laws

 Hey must is a verb in some languages  Just happens it is only a modifier
 in English  But the verb of the sentence is to have  This is modified
 by must  

I know that must is a verb in some languages   Im complaining
about the assertion containing the word must
