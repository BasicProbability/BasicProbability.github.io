  Some here on altatheism think that by condemning the actions 
  of some of those who call themselves Muslims they are condemning 
  Islam
 
 Do you read minds Mr Rice   You know what posters think now
 not just what they write
 
 For myself I only have what people are posting here to go on
 and thats what I am commenting on
 
 I think you may have misunderstood me
 
 I mean that one does not really criticize Islam necessarily by
 bringing Khomeini etc into the argument for whether he is or is not
 following Islam has to be determined by examining his actions against
 Islamic teachings  Islamic teachings are contained in the Quran and
 hadiths reported sayings and doings of the Prophet

Thats funny I thought you were making a statement about what
people think    In fact I see it quoted up there
