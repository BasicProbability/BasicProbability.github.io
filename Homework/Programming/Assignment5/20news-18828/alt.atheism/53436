 Logic alert   argument from incredulity  Just because it is hard for you 
 to believe this doesnt mean that it isnt true  Liars can be very pursuasive
 just look at Koresh that you yourself cite

This is whole basis of a great many here rejecting the Christian
account of things In the words of St Madalyn MurreyOHair Face it
folks its just silly  Why is it okay to disbelieve because of
your incredulity if you admit that its a fallacy
