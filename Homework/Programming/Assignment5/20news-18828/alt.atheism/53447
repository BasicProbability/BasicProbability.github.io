 While were on the topic of books has anyone else noticed that Paines
 The Age of Reason is hard to find  Ive been wanting to pick up
 a copy for a while but not bad enough to mail order it  Ive noticed
 though that none of the bookstores I go to seem to carry it  I thought
 this was supposed to be classic  Whats the deal
 
 
   Me too  Our local used book store is the second largest on the
   West Coast and I couldnt find a copy there  I guess atheists
   hold their bibles in as much esteem as the theists

If I remember correctly Prometheus books have this one in stock
so just call them and ask for the book

Cheers
Kent
