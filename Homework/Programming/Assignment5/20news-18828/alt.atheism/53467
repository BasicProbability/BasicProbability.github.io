 As for your question of moral freeagency given the Christian
 position above the freedom we have is to acknowledge God The
 morality we practice is a direct outgrowth of how we excercise that
 freedom You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to
 ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known
 in both cases That an atheist cant accept the evidence means only
 that he prefers not to accept it it says nothing about the evidence
 itself 

I agree I had a hard feeling not believing my grandgrand mother
who told me of elves dancing outside barns in the early mornings
I preferred not to accept it even if her statement provided
the truth itself Life is hard

Cheers
