 The problem with your argument is that you do not know who is a real
 believer and who may be faking it  This is something known only by
 the person himherself and God  Your assumption that anyone who
 claims to be a believer is a believer is not necessarily true

So that still leaves the door totally open for Khomeini Hussein
et rest They could still be considered true Muslims and you cant
judge them because this is something between God and the person

You have to apply your rule as well with atheistsagnostics you
dont know their belief this is something between them and God

So why the hoopla about Khomeini not being a real Muslim and the
hoopla about atheists being not real human beings
