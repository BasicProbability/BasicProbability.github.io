Peter   Simple logic arguments are folly  If you read the Bible you
will see
  that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic
  Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation  Yet some think it is
  the ultimate  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
  know more than you do now   To learn you must accept that which
  you dont know
 
 Can anyone eaplain what hes just said here

I cant It seems Jesus used logic to make people using logic
look like fools No that does not sound right he maybe just
told they were fools and thats it and people believed that
Hmm does not sound reasonable either

I find it always very intriguing to see people stating that
transcendental values cant be explained and then in the
next sentence they try to explain these unexplained values
Highly strange

Cheers
Kent
