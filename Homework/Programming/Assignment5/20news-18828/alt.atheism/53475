 To credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to
 misunderstand human nature the function of religion and of course
 history I believe that those who distort history in this way know
 exaclty what theyre doing and do it only for affect

However to underestimate the power of religion creating historical
events is also a big misunderstanding For instance would the
30yearold war have ever started if there were no fractions
between the Protestants and the Vatican
