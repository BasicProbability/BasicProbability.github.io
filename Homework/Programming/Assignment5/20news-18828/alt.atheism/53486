God is the One Who created the night the day the sun and the moon
Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion Quran 33

The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr Maurice Bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time and for
a long time afterwards there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
or anywhere in the Quran

 
Well that is certainly different but it looks as if there is a translation
found for everything By the way I am most surprised to hear that night and
day move in an orbit
 
And that the sun travels in an orbit without saying that earth does too
sounds geocentric to me
