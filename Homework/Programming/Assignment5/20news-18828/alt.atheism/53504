 The problem with most peaceniks it they consider those of us who are
 not like them to be bad and unconscionable  I would not have any
 argument or problem with a peacenik if they held to their ideals and
 stayed out of all conflicts or issues especially those dealing with 
 the national defense  But no they are not willing to allow us to
 legitimately hold a different pointofview  They militate and 
 many times resort to violence all in the name of peace

Yawn  Another rightwing WASP imagining hes an oppressed minority 
Perhaps Camille Paglia is right after all

Personal attacks  

I would not have any argument or problem with a peacenik if they 
stayed out of all conflicts or issues  I bet you wouldnt  Youd love it 

Deliberate misinterpretation of a persons statement  By cutting out
the part of the statement he tries to blunt the thrust of the sentence
He never addresses the issue of extreemist peace people not holding true
to their ideals

But what makes you think that sitting back saying nothing about defense
issues and letting people like you make all the decisions is anything to do
with their ideals

Ignoring the challenge  He ignores the challenge that extreemists for
peace tend to be quite insistent that everyone accept their ideals for
the world and have even turned quite violent  Witness Chicago summer
1968

Paranoia  He assumes that anyone who argues against his viewpoint must
masturbate over GunsNAmmo
