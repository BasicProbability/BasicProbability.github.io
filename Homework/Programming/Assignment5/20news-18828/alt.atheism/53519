Subject Nostalgia


  The recent rise of nostalgia in this group combined with the
  incredible level of utter bullshit has prompted me to comb
  through my archives and pull out some of The Best of AltAtheism
  for your reading pleasure  Ill post a couple of these a day
  unless group concensus demands that I stop or I run out of good
  material

  I havent been particularly careful in the past about saving
  attributions  I think the following comes from John A Johnson
  but someone correct me if Im wrong  This is probably the longest
  of my entire collection




                                  So that the
                                  Prophecy be
                                   Fulfilled

                                       

       In considering the Christian religion and judging it
according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at
fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy  The scribe Matthew is perhaps
the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in
the career of Jesus of Nazareth  As you will see Matthews main
strategy is to take various Old Testament passages often not even
about the promised Messiah and apply them to the circumstances in
the New Testament  We must also bear in mind the question of the
authenticity of the accounts  Since the gospels were written at
least 35 years after Jesus was executed we do not know how much
happened exactly as stated  But for purposes of analysis we
will take particular claims at face value

Immanuel

       We begin of course at the beginning

       Mt 12122  Mary will bear a son and you
       Joseph will name him Jesus which means Gd is
       salvation for he will save his people from their
       sins  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had
       spoken by a prophet

       Isaiah 7116  In the days of Ahaz c 750 BCE
       king of Judah Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made
       war on Jerusalem capitol of Judah but could not
       quite conquer it  When the house of David ie Ahaz
       and his court in Judah were told of this its
       heart and the heart of its people shook   And the
       lord Gd said to Isaiah go to meet with Ahaz 
       And the lord spoke to Ahaz through prophet Isaiah
       naturally saying Ask a sign of Gd your lord  It
       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven  But
       Ahaz said I wont ask I will not put the lord to a
       test  Then Isaiah said Hear then O house of
       David  Is it not enough for you to weary men that
       you must weary my god too  Therefore the lord
       himself will give you a sign  Behold a young woman
       is with child and will bear a son and name him
       Immanuel which means Gd is with us   He will
       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil
       and choose good  For before the child knows how to
       refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings
       you dread will have been deserted

Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics 
Further he the Hebrew word almah young woman as
specifically virgin  But this is not a prophecy about the
Messiah  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years
later  It is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother  In
short it not about Jesus  Matthew has made use of a verse out of
context and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary  It
should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general
manner a very general one it can be made to fit Mary  Mary
virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child  Of course
the fit is shady and has problems  Jesus while thought of by
later Christians to be Gd walking among men was never called by
the name Immanuel  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy
for Jesus it becomes at best a cutandpaste prophecy a second
class prophecy   Not too convincing

Egypt

       After Jesuss birth in Bethlehem Matthew tells about a
quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to Egypt as if he
wishes to liken Jesus to Moses  This was done to escape an
alleged infanticidal rampage of the king Herod

       Mt 215  and remained there until the death of
       Herod  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken
       Out of Egypt I have called my son


What the lord really said was this

       Hosea 111  When Israel was a child I loved him 
       And out of Egypt I called my son  The more I called
       them my people the more they went from me they
       kept sacrificing to the Baals and kept burning
       incense to idols

Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hoseas oracle  But it
was indeed Israel that once called out of Egypt wanted to
return  This is history  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of
here  And if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind
up with a Jesus that flees and resists Gd   Again this prophecy
is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped

Rachel Weeps

        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt Matthew says that
King Herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of
all young male children  Matthew then writes

       Mt 21718   By this that which was spoken by the
       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled

       A voice was heard in Ramah wailing and loud
       lamentation Rachel weeping for her children
       she refused to be consoled because they were
       no more   

The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 3115 referring to the
carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon of Assyria in 722
BCE  Rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel Ephraim
and Manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no
more  It is metaphorical of course since Rachel lived and dies
before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile
       It is interesting to note that it was Leah not Rachel who
was the ancestor of the Judeans the land where Jesus and
Bethlehem were  If anyone should do weeping for her children
it is Leah  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is
that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city
on the way to Ephrath Bethlehem
       As for Herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely
that such an event actually occurred  One never knows but the
event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible
nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time 
Herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less
evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded  This might be a
prime example of how events were added to Jesuss life to enhance
the message of the churchs gospel
       Because of the whole storys similarity to the tale of the
infant Moses in Egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set
up by Matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of Jesus
It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention
the rest of the Jeremiah quote   The children the prophet
speaks of are not dead but exiled in the Assyrian Empire  Gd
comforts the weeping Rachel saying that the children will be
returned he will gather them back together  Of course this
would not suit Matthews purpose as the children he speaks of are
dead for good  Again the prophecy Matthew sets up is not even
that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too
convincing

The Nazarene

       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find
another Matthean prophecy  After leaving Egypt Joseph  wife
take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth 

       Mt 223  that what was spoken of by the prophets
       might be fulfilled He shall be called a Nazarene

First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of
the prophets this time  Second we have to ask who He is 
There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene  Worse
there are no prophecies period mentioning a Nazarene  Still
worse there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at
all  In the book of Judges an angel tells Samsons mother that
she will

       Judges 135  conceive and bear a son  No razor
       shall tough his head for he will be a Nazirite to his
       god from the day of his birth  He will deliver Israel
       from the hands of the Philistines

This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus or the messiah of Gd 
But it is the best that can be found  Obviously Matthew has
begun to go overboard in cutandpaste prophecies in that he is
simple making them up now

Bearing our
Diseases

       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses
and disabilities

       Mt 817   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the
       prophet Isaiah He took our infirmities and bore our
       diseases

As expected the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context
and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme  We have

       Is 534  Surely he the suffering servant has
       borne our sickness and carried our pains

From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah we know that
the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation
of Israel Jehovahs chosen servant and people  He speaks to the
Israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations
that look upon it  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish
identity an image of a chastised yet cherished Israel as the
instrument of the nations salvation by Gd
      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which
are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and
discipline  They do not speak of a servant going around and
healing people  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the
sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual Jews  Jesus
as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself  The
verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but
rather something that had already happened  While it is believed
that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear
the illnesses he healed  So while someone might want to say
that figuratively Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his
spiritual atonement he has to admit that Matthews parallel
misses where he intended it to have its effect


Silent Messiah

      Upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that Jesus
ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldnt arouse
the attention of the local rulers

       Mt 121521  This was to fulfill what was spoken by
       the prophet Isaiah   

       Behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved
       with whom my soul is pleased  I will put my spirit on
       him and he will announce justice to the Gentiles  He
       will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear
       his voice in the streets  He will not break a bruised
       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings
       justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his
       name

The Isaiah passage quoted reads

       Is 4214  Behold my servant whom I uphold my
       chosen in whom my soul delights  I have put my
       spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the
       nations  We will not cry or lift up his voice or
       make it heard in the street  He will not break a
       bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick  He will
       faithfully bring forth justice  He will not fail
       burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has
       established justice in the earth  And the coastlands
       await his law

You see Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage
because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus  Christians could
never think of Jesus failing never would the light of mankind
burn dimly  But the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to
an end when its job is done  When the gentiles come to embrace
Gd there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will
be the children of Gd  Also the ending phrase has been changed
from the Judaic the coastlands await his law to the
Christologic the Gentiles will hope in his name   While the
original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah the other rewrites it
to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name  If one
has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus one has only
to read the whole chapter Isaiah 42 and hear about the beloved
but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and
plundered   So we see that when Matthews attempt at
prophecy is examined it crumbles

Three Days and
Three Nights

      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very
mouth of the god Jesus himself  He speaks of his crucifixion and
resurrection

       Mt 1240   For as Jonah was in the belly of the
       whale for three days and three nights so will the Son
       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and
       three nights

Before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know
how the Jews understood days  As far as day names went each was
24 hours long lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset
6pm  What was referred to as a day was the period of light from
6am to the ending sunset at 6pm  Thus according to our time
scale a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening and lasted until
6pm saturday evening  This is why the Jews celebrate their
sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays instead of Sundays 
It seems like a real miracle that Christians didnt forget that
Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week  Thus
when days and nights are referred to together 12 hour daylight
portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of  Thus
Jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise
unresurrected for three days and three nights

      As the good book tells us Jesus was crucified on the ninth
hour which is 3pm Friday afternoon  He then was put into the
grave sometime after that  Then Jesus left the grave rose
before dawn of what we call Sunday The dawn after the sabbath was
over  What this means is that Jesus was using our time for
clarity in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before
6am Sunday morning  We could also add a little time before 6pm
Friday since the bible is not specific here  What this means
using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two
nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day  Certainly this
is a problem for Jesus prediction  There is absolutely no way we
are even able to have his death involve three days and three
nights even using modern time measurements   We then are led to
suspect that this error is another one of Matthews little
mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his
gods mouth   And no matter who made the prediction it is more
than unconvincing it is counterconvincing

Hearing 
Understanding

     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in
parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if
you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the
message of Jesus  He reasons that those who can understand the
parables are the ones he wants  If the people cannot understand
them there is no need to bother with them since they will not
accept the plain message any better  Matthew says

       Mt 131416  With them the audience indeed in
       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says 

       You will indeed hear but never understand and you
       will indeed see but never perceive  Because this
       peoples heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of
       hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they
       would not perceive with them her with their ears and
       understand with their heart and turn for me to heal
       them

The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his
call to the ministry  This is in 740 BCE when Israel is
flourishing right before it falls under the authority of Assyria 
Isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from Gd
calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah

       Is 6913  And Gd said Go and say to this
       people Hear and hear but do not understand see and
       see but do not perceive   Make the heart of this
       people fat make their ears heavy and shut their
       eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear
       with their ears and understand with their hearts and
       turn and be healed  Then Isaiah said How long
       lord  And he said Until the cities lie waste
       without inhabitant and houses without men and the
       land is utterly desolate and the Gds take men far
       away and forsaken places are many in the land  And
       though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned
       again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still
       stands when the tree is felled The holy seed is its
       stump

Here we see that it is really Gd who causes the people of Israel
to stop listening to the prophets warnings but reaffirms the
promise made to Solomons and Davids seedlineage  If you read
the rest of Isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan
of Gd to use Israel as a servant a light to the nations  Look
at Isaiah 421825 4820 493
     We see that Matthew has cutandpasted just a little portion
of Isaiahs verse to suit his own gospel needs  More than that
he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didnt
understand Jesuss stories  And as we see Isaiahs verses are
not prophecies but rather commands from Gd to him in the
present   Once again Matthews prophecy falls flat on its face 

     Matthew tries again to make Jesuss parables look like they
have the prophetic approval

       Mt 1335  he said nothing to them without a
       parable  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the
       prophet I will open my mouth to them in parables  I
       will utter that which has been hidden since the
       foundation of the world

Matthew really botches up here  He attempts to quote not from a
prophet but from the Psalms

       Ps 7824  I will open my mouth in parable  I will
       utter dark sayings of old things that we all have
       heard and known things that our fathers have told us 
       We will not hide them from their children but tell to
       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the
       lord

As was pointed out the verses in the Psalms do not really come
from a prophet  You might also want to know that earlier copies
of Matthews gospel even inserted Isaiahs name as this prophet 
Apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some
of it up
     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that once
again Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures  As Jesus
has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not
understand them  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden 
Further they speak of things known that our fathers have told
us  Jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the
world  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion 
This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms  No
wonder Matthew had to rewrite them   And still once again
Matthews artificial prophecies fall flat on their face  But
Christians rarely look at this  Matthews prophecies arent the
only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad


Excuses of
Little Faith

       In Mt 171421 we see that the disciples are able to go
around casting out demons except in one case  Not knowing what
epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were
possesed with demons  It is no wonder that the disciples were
unable to dispossess the epileptic  But Jesus perhaps no more
enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying
they didnt have enough faith   This seems strange  Why was this
demon special  It seems that either a true believer has faith or
he does not  Apparently enough faith will allow someone to move
mountains  Of course you will find no one these days that can
move real mountains  No one parts seas  The only miracles the
Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to
Mexico or some faraway place  Major miracles are making some old
womans arthritis feel better on Sunday morning TV

       And the gods including Jesus are always shrouded in
ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their
sacred pasts  They are either dead sleeping or hiding in
heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and
their great miracles of days long gone  Yet life goes on  

     Tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time
or a distant place  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the
old days Jehovah too  But now they are silent  All the
theologians give are various excuses as to why we dont get to see
God anymore

       Were too lazy were not zealous enough were
       sinful its just his plan we put too many of our
       own demands on Gds appearance if we had the right
       faith if we  were willing to meet Gd on his terms

     Yet even the most pious of men have not seen Gd  You dear
reader have not seen Gd  Not literally you know that to be
true I know thats presumptuous and bold  But searching your
heart you know what I mean  All that weve seen religions do is
make people feel good and content about not seeing Gd  They say
our little faith does not merit us to see Gd  Sometimes they
say See the love in these people you worship with see the
lives of people change that is seeing Gd   Thus people get
lulled to sleep satisfied with turning Gd into the everyday
sights   But that is not seeing Gd as I am speaking of it is
not seeing Gd the way people used to see  
      What we see in the world that is good is the compassion of
human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the
forgiveness practised by Christian  Atheist alike beauty created
by the mind of man  These are the things that are done these are
what we see  But it is said this is so only because everybody
has little faith

Jesus Rides on
an Ass

       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah
king Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into
Jerusalem  

       Mt 215  This took place to fulfil what was spoken
       by the prophet saying

       Tell the daughter of Zion Behold your king is
       coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a
       asscolt

Of course the passage quoted from Zechariah 99 reads a little
differently

       Lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and
       victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass
       colt he will command peace to the nations

There isnt all that much difference here except that Zechariah
only involves one animal  an asscolt  while Matthew reads the
poetic wording slightly differently  Thus he has Jesus call for
both a colt and an adult ass  From Matthews version we get a
comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two
donkeys  This could inevitably lead to a theological
proctological dilemma   We find that in the account written
earlier by St Mark only the colt was called for and brought to
Jesus  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly and
shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has
bungled  Now excluding many respectable Christians I have met I
have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses
the situation is often reversed nowadays

       Then entering the Jerusalem temple the priests were
angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah  But
Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done

       Mt 2116  Havent you read  Out of the mouth of
       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise

It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus
was never one to point out such little prophetic things AND
since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to
fit Matthews track record quite well  We might ask Jesus or
Matthew Havent you read for the source reads

       Psalms 812  O YaHWeH our lord how majestic is
       your name in the whole world   You whose glory is
       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you
       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the
       enemy and the avenger

The passages hardly need comment  There is no perfect praise
spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to Gd
not his messiah king and not Jesus  As mentioned it seems to be
just one more case of Matthews pen making up convenient prophetic
scripture

YHVH said to 
my lord

      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish
messiahking is to be descended  The Jews agree it is king
David  But then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110

       The LORD said to my Lord sit at my right hand until
       I put your enemies under your feet

Taken at face value Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic
descent  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer  Of
course the Christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to
make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine
nature of the messiahking  Its tempting to believe this if one
is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation 
But there are problems
       In Jesuss time the psalm was thought to be about the
messiah  And it is easy to see why David might refer to the
messiah as his superior  We need only look at the scriptures
about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king
bringing the Jews to times even better than those under Davids
rule  Of course the Jews listening had no good answer and the
passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the
Christians worship  The problem lies in the meaning of this
psalm an error that apparently several Jews of Jesuss time had
also made  One must remember that there were various factions
among the Jews often as a result of different expectations of the
messiahking  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists like
his audience who thought the messiahs advent was imminent and
who interpreted Psalms 110 among others as being messianic
What is the problem then  Psalm 110 literally reads

       YHVHs utterance to my lord
	Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your
       footstool

       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion  Rule
       in the midst of your foes  Your people will offer
       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the
       holy mountains  

       You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek
       forever

The word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian
bibles to denote divinity in this lord  But in the Hebrew the
word is adoni and no capitalisation exists  Adoni simply means
lord a generic term as we would use it  It is used often in
the scriptures to refer to kings and to Gd  It is merely an
address of respect  
      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word
refers either to divinity or to the messiahking  That this is
supposed to be written by David is not certain  The title of the
psalm translates to either a psalm of David or a psalm about
David  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court
poet about Davids covenant and endorsement from Gd  If the
psalm had been written by David it is unlikely that he would be
talking about the messiah  The idea of a perfect king descended
from David was not present in Davids age  We have extensive
tales of Davids doings and sayings none of which include any
praises of a messiah
     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after
David was dead in times of the exile when Gd had put his show of
favour for Davids kingdom on hold  
     The description in the psalm fit David very well  David was
promised by Gd a rise to power victory over his enemies
successful judgement among the nations he conquered  He achieved
the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king
enabled to bless the people   It all fits
      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone
though  Here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though
his use of the scripture is rather questionable  Still this
event is common to the other gospels too  So we let Matthew off
a little more easily this time  It is interesting to note
though how Matthew dresses up the event  The earlier gospel of
Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd 
Matthew has the Pharisees who became the religious competition of
an infant Christianity be the target of Jesuss question  As we
might expect Matthew writes that the event ends up by
embarrassing the Pharisees  Such power is the pen

Moses  Jesus
Had it Together
All Along

       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a
pseudoprophecy in Johns gospel  The gospel story of John
deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed
from the real events of Jesuss career as told by even Matthew 
But for the moment we will just look at one verse  The early
church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah
king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made
by Gd  When constructing the history of Abraham Moses wrote of
a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people  While this
was accomplished eventually under the rule of king David the
Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the
fulfillment of the promise  But to do so they expanded on the
promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom

       John 856 JC speaking Your father Abraham
       rejoiced to see My day  He say it and was glad

It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham but
Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah or anything Christian 
I have tried and failed to find any event in the Old Testament
which corresponds to Johns little prophecy  It is par for the
course to see St John making up Old Testament backings just like
his forerunner Matthew  Many Christians know that their faith has
many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they
still cling to it

The Potters
Field

      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by
one of his followers Judas Iscariot   Matthew writes

       Mt 27510  And throwing down the pieces of silver
       in the temple Judas departed But the chief
       priests taking the silver said It isnt lawful for
       us to put it in the treasury since it is blood
       money  So they bought a potters field with it to
       bury strangers in Then was fulfilled what was
       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah

       And they took the thirty pieces of silver the price
       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the
       sons of Israel and they gave them for the potters
       field as the lord directed me

This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament
Scripture  First Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name
of the prophet  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which
Matthew makes use of

       Zech 111213  And they weighed out my wages
       thirty shekels of silver  Then YHVH said to me Cast
       them to the treasury the lordly price at which I
       was paid off by them  So I took the thirty shekels of
       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of
       YHVH

First of all the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer
of the messiah or of Gd  The deal with a shepherd most likely
a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people
shortly before Gd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with
one another  The word treasury had been replaced by the King
James Scholars with to the potter precisely because this made
Matthews quote fit better  But this is a blatant error  The
correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed treasury which also
makes perfect sense in Zechariahs context whereas potters
field is totally unrelated  Whether the mistranslation was
intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation  However given
Matthews track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of
intentional dishonesty
      Of course Matthew would have ample reason for altering the
text  The thirty pieces of silver match Judass situation and if
as most Christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard
the contextual incongruity Matthew might have another prophecy to
toss around  However the correct translation of Zechariah
directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high
priests  The high priests would not put the money in the
treasury  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the
opposite  Of course to the average ThursdayNight Bible student
the prophecy as presented by Matthew would be taken at New
Testament face value  To those Matthews work is convincing
enough

Wine Vinegar
 Casting Lots

      Then Jesus is led away to be crucified

       Mt 273435  they gave him vinegar to drink
       mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not
       drink it  And when they had crucified him they
       divided his garments among them by casting lots that
       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet

       They parted my garments among them and upon my
       vesture did they cast lots

First of all the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour
wine of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly  We find
that right before Jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him
some to drink not polluted with gall

       Jn 192830  Jesus said I thirst  A bowl of
       vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the
       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth  When he
       had received the vinegar he said It is finished

But Matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the
prophets but one from the Psalms

       Ps 692028  I looked for pity but there was none
       and for comforters but I found none  They gave me
       poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and
       for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink  Add
       to them punishment upon punishment may they have no
       acquittal from thee  Let them be blotted out of the
       Book of the Living

Of course the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request
of drink  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity  The psalm
quoted is about David and his political and military enemies  It
is not about the messiah or Jesus  It is then not surprising that
we run into further problem when we see that the Jesus in the
psalm asks Gd for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the
Jesus of the gospels says

       Lk 2334  Jesus said Father forgive them the
       dont know what they do

Further Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by
having gall a bitter substance put into Jesuss drink not his
meat as the psalm stipulates

       With the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally
ask What of the casting of lots  This brings up the 22nd
Psalm which deserves discussion all by itself  Suffice it now to
say that the fact that Jesuss clothes were divided as told is no
great thing  It turns out that this happened often to any felon
in those days  As we will soon see it is perhaps the least
erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus  It does
indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of
Jesuss clothes  For a man so removed from worldly possessions
his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some
suspicions

The 22nd Psalm

      This psalm is attributed to David as a lament of his
condition under the attack of his enemies  It becomes a song of
praise to YHVH and of hope  Taken out of context parts of it
seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well  We
will examine the primary passages

       Verse 12  My god my god why have you forsaken me 
       Why are you so far from helping me far from the words
       of my groaning  Oh my god I cry by day but you
       dont answer and by night but find no rest

Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross 
This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus rather
than king David  Of course the rest of the first stanza does not
fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution  Jesus is not pictured as
complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the
lamb led mute before its shearers  Indeed Jesus doesnt do much
groaning even when on the cross  He certainly does not cry by
both day and night on the cross

       68  But I am a worm and no man scorned by men 
       All who see me mock at me  They make faces and wag
       their heads  He committed his cause to YHVH  So let
       him deliver him for he delights in him

This seems to fit Jesuss execution pretty well with the
exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm

       1213  Many bulls encompass me they open their
       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion

       1618  Yea dogs are round about me a company of
       evildoers encircle me they have pierced my hands and
       feet  I can see all my bones They divide my
       garments among them and cast lost for my raiment

       1921  But you YHVH be not far away  Deliver my
       soul from the sword my life from the power of the
       dog  Save me from the mouth of the lion and my
       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull

It would seem quite convincing and Im sure the early Christian
fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too  Unfortunately
this prophecy has a fatal flaw  The words have pierced really
do not exist in the psalm  The correct Hebrew translation is

       16  Yea dogs are round about me a company of
       evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my
       hands and feet

In Hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form
which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character  The
word in the Hebrew text is literally like the lion kaari
which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal
imagery employed by the psalm writer  It is convenience that
would urge a Christian to change the word to kaaru   But to
add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is
just what the Christian translators have chosen to do  While the
correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to
Jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the
translators

       Apart from the erroneous verse 16 the psalm does not lend
itself to Jesus so easily  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being
saved from a sword rather than a cross  This naturally fits the
psalms true subject king David  As a side note we now know
that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather
the forearms  This doesnt say much in favour of the traditional
thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on
his palms  But then facts arent bound by our religious beliefs

      Matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not
attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord
Jesus  But the psalm like many others was on the minds of all
the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and
interpretations of Jesuss life and death  How much these
scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down
is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian
theology  It is easy to see for those who are not faithful
fundamentalists how some of the events in the New Testament might
have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager Matthew  But
it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural
matters and prophetic claims  So far this has not said good
things for St Matthew

The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesuss
crucifixion  Johns gospel recount written about 70 years after
the fact tells us at Jesuss execution

       Jn 193437  But one of the soldiers pierced his
       side with a spear and out came blood and water
       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled
       The will look on him whom theyve pierced

Of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of
context   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of
Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with
them

       Zc 12710  And YHVH will give victory to Judah
       And on that day I will seek to destroy the nations
       that come against Jerusalem in Judah  And I will
       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on
       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have
       pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him
       like you weep over a firstborn child

Johns attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that
Matthews attempts  Matthew at least usually excontexts more
than just one passage  Johns errors are grossly obvious and
blatant here  It does not speak well for any of the gospel
writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their
religion were founded


Reckoned with
Transgressors

       After his arrest Jesus is quickly executed for claiming
the Jewish kingship messiahship   According to one version of
the gospel tale Jesus gets executed along with two thieves

       Mk 1527  And with him they crucified two robbers
       one on his right one on his left  And so the
       scripture was fulfilled which says

       He was reckoned with the transgressors

Here Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53
about the servant nation of Israel  The passage is not about the
messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53 and its
surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation  The
verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the
past not a prediction of what is to come in any event  The
servant is thought of as a criminal  This also happens to fit the
description of Jesus  Had the passage really been about the
messiah it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between
two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in Isaiah  Jesus would
more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry  He was
considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his
career   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to
steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that Mark could
have had made a better analogy with general comparisons

       Mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with
Jesus also reviled him 1532  This is to be expected from a
couple of robbers  Of course in his later recount St Luke
decides to change some things  Luke tells us

       Lk 233943  And one of the criminals who was hanged
       with him railed Arent you the messiah Save
       yourself and us

This certainly fits with Marks recount which tells how the
people who crucified Jesus said Save yourself and that the
robbers did the same  But then Luke goes on

       But the other criminal rebuked the first saying
       Dont you fear Gd since you are under the same
       sentence of condemnation  And we indeed justly so
       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds 
       But this man has done nothing wrong And he said
       Jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom 
       And Jesus answered Verily I say to you today you
       will be with me in paradise

Now this little dialogue seems highly contrived  It stretches
the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking
his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech  We have a rather
strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his
punishment and the justness of his suffering   Such a man
apparently noble and of principle doesnt seem likely to have
been a robber  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by
Luke  Of course Lukes recount also disagrees with Marks  
Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus not both  It is easy
enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made
up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free
words of Gd do not have this avenue open  This is yet another
example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and
expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology  In this case
the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have
seen

The End of the
World
       Mt 24

       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and
embarrassing passages in the New Testament  It is found in all
three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most
unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity  Jesus
mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings and
his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world
which he has been warning about

       The disciples Tell us when will this the temples
       destruction be and what will be the sign of your
       coming and of the close of the age

       Jesus Take care that no one leads you astray for
       many will come in my name saying I am the christ  
       you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for
       this must take place but the end is not yet   For
       nation will rise against nation all this is but the
       beginning of the birthpangs
             They will deliver you up put you to death
       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray
       But he who endures to the end will be saved  This
       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a
       testimony to the nations and then the end will come
             So when you see the desolation spoken of by the
       prophet Daniel let those who are in Judea flee to
       the mountains

             Immediately after the tribulation of those days
       the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from
       heaven then will appear the sign of the Son of Man
       in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
       and see the Son of Man coming and he will send out
       his angels and gather his elect
             Learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its
       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know
       that summer is near  So also when you see all these
       things you will know that He is near at the very
       gate  Truly I say to you this generation will not
       pass away until all these things take place
             But of the day and hour no one knows not the
       angels not the Son but only the Father Therefore
       you also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming
       at an hour you do not expect

From this it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in
within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples  He tells
them that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour that it
will come and thus they must be ready  Theologians have wet
their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error 
But unfortunately Jesus made himself to explicit  He told his
disciples that their generation would still be around at the End
and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be
swept away
      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant
nature of the Bible and said that the phrase this generation
shall not pass away really means this race of people will not
pass away  Of course the word for generation is used many
times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples 
It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek
he didnt learn it well enough to make himself clear  But it is
quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at
least some of them are supposed to live to the End of the World 
The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking
at the Apostles responses  It becomes abundantly clear from
Rev 227 1 Peter 47 1 John 218 and Rev 2220 that Jesus
meant exactly what he said  The End was very near

       For 2000 years Christians have rationalised this 24th
chapter of Matthew or ignored its meaning altogether  For 2000
years they have waited for their executed leader to come back
hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that He is coming soon 
Surely He must be  All we must do is wait  Can you imagine how
tired He must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for
just the right moment to spring


       So shortly after his crucifixion Jesus of Nazareth
JoshuabenJoseph died   It is said that after three days or
three days and three nights or three periods of time or three
eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for
less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine
radiance  Then the Saviour decided it wasnt in the best
interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore
disappeared from sight into heaven  So the story goes anyway 
As has been seen there were many things attributed to Jesus when
people got around to writing the gospel stories down  To them
Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture  We have
seen though that this matter is quite shaky  But throughout
Church history Christians have held fast to faith in simple
belief  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with
argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away
from question  To question and investigate has never been the
easiest way to treat matters  Thus for 2000 years the
prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely
accepted  Things may well continue that way for some time 
Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity
have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support
wars and persecution I suppose there is one prophecy of which
Christianity can securely keep hold

       Mt 1034  Jesus Dont think that I have come to
       bring peace on earth  I havent come to bring peace
       but rather a sword
