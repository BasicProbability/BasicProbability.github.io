Subject Re Religion As Cause  Was islamic authority over women

 The same works for the horrors of history  To claim that Christianity
 had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the
 awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute  What it seems you
 are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never
 the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that
 religion has had no evil impacts on history  That is absurd

Scott

Until this paragraph I would willingly amend my earlier statements
since your points are well made and generally accurate This last
part though slips into hyperbole Since Ive discussed my objections to
such generalizations before I really dont feel I need to do it
again If you havent seen those posts ask Maddi she saves
everything I write
