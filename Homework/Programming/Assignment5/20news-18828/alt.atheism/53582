 So Mr Conner   Is Bobby Mozumder a myth a performing artist
 a real Moslem a crackpot a provocateur    You know everything
 and read all minds why dont you tell us
 
  
 As a side note isnt it telling that one cannot say for sure if
 Bobby Mozunder is a firm believer or a provocateur What does
 that say about religious beliefs

I think thats an insightful comment   Especially when at the
same time we have people like Bill Projector Conner complaining
that we are posting parodies
