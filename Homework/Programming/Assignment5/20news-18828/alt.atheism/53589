 Im not in a position to say since I know nothing
  about the situation  That does not in my estimation qualify me
  as having my head up my ass


Bob I never accused you of having your head up your ass It takes
me quite some time in dealing with someone before accusing them of
having their head up their ass I was accusing the original poster
Benedikt I believe of being so impaired

  Could you maybe flesh it out just a bit  Or did I miss the full
  grandeur of its content by virtue of my blinding atheism

You may be having difficulty seeing the light because you
have your head up your ass I suggest making sure this is
not the case before posting again

 
Thats was the original answer While it does not say that he has the head
necessarily up its ass it would be meaningless and pointless if it was not
insinuated
