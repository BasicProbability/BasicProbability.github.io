Subject Re Who has read Rushdies The Satanic Verses

 Anyway since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
 of discussion I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
 read this book  What are your thoughts on it

I bought a copy of The Satanic Verses when there was talk of the British
Government banning it  Theres nothing interests me in a book more than
making it illegal

However its still sitting on my shelf unread  Perhaps Ill get round to it
soon  Ive still got a pile of Lem Bulgakov and Zamyatin to go through I
dont find nearly enough time to read  In fact there are far more
interesting things to do than I can ever find time for how anyone ever
manages to be bored is beyond me  If I didnt have to sleep maybe I could
manage it
