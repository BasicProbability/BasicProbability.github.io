 Well suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was
 sent towards a black hole  As it got closer to the event horizon the
 red shift would keep increasing  The period would get longer and longer
 but it would never stop  An observer would not observe the probe actually
 reaching the event horizon  The detected energy from the probe would keep
 decreasing but it wouldnt vanish  Expt never quite reaches zero
 
   Thats kind of what I meant  To be more precise given any observer in any
 single position outside the event horizon would that observer ever in any way
 be able to detect the probe having crossed the event horizon

Yes unless the observer is at rest with respect to the singularity at
infinite distance away But an observer on a close approach to the BH will
see the particle go in in finite time

Dont forget to sing
            They say theres a heaven for those who will wait
                Some say its better but I say it aint
        Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
                     The sinners are much more fun
                         Only the good die young
