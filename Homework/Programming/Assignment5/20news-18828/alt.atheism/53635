The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to 
But think about it for a minute  Would you rather have someone love
you because you made them love you or because they wanted to
love you 

Theres a difference between believing in the existence of an entity
and loving that entity God could show me directly that he exists
and Id still have a free choice about whether to love him or not So
why doesnt he
