 Noting that a particular society in this case the mainland UK
 has few religously motivated murders and few murders of any
 kind says very little about whether interreligion murders elsewhere
 are religiously motivated
 
 No but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent
 in all religion or for that matter in catholicism and protestantism
 that motivates one to kill

Motivates or allows    The Christian Bible says that one may kill
under certain circumstances   In fact it instructs one to kill under
certain circumstances     

Id say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them
to kill under certain circumstances  I do get your distinction between
motivate and allow and I do agree that if a flavour of theism allows
atoricities then thats an indictment of that theism  But it rather
depends on what the certain circumstances are  When you talk about
Christianity or Islam then at least your claims can be understood
Its when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls
apart  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly
harmless

 For my part I conclude that something
 else is required  I also happen to believe that that something
 else will work no less well without religion  any easy ThemUs will
 do

And what does religion supply if not an easy ThemUs

Not necessarily  Love thy neighbour does not supply a themus  it
demolishes it  And my definition of religion is broader than my
definition of theism as I have explained

 By insisting that even the murder of four labourers chosen because
 they were catholics and who had nothing to do with the IRA by 
 Protestant extremists is not religously motivated I think what 
 you are saying is that you simply will not accept any murder as 
 being religiously motivated
 
 No  What about that guy who cut off someones head because he believed 
 he was the devil incarnate  That was religously motivated

What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic 
labourers     That wasnt religiously motivated

Not in my opinion  If they were doing it because of some obscure
point of theology then yes  But since all protestants dont do this
nor do they elect extremists to do it for them its just too broad
too say religion did this  Im saying that the causes are far more
complex than that  take away the religious element and youd still
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism  You
know when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say stop the 
killing one might listen to that especially when you claim not
to read minds


 Also the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr Rushdie the Inquisitions
 and the many religous wars

Whats so special about these exceptions    Isnt this all just a
grabbag of adhoc excuses for not considering some other murders
to be religiously motivated    Whats the general principle behind
all this

The general principle is that its fairly clear to me at least that
religion is the primary motivator enabler whatever of these  Its
not nearly so obvious whats going on when one looks at NI apart
from violence of course

 Its not an abstract argument   Northern Irish Protestants say
 We dont want to be absorbed into am officially Catholic country
 
 Now what are we supposed to do   Are we supposed to reply No
 thats only what you think you dont want   Mr ODwyer assures us
 that no matter what you say you want you really want something 
 else
 
 You think the Unionists wouldnt mind being absorbed into a nonCatholic 
 country other than the UK of course   Its a terrible thing to lose
 a mind   Maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks
 I certainly dont believe that the Unionists are in it for God  I think
 they wish to maintain their position of privilege

Im still listening to what they say and you are still telling us 
your version of what they think   You read minds and I dont

Youve speculated on my motives often enough and you dont take
my statements of my own beliefs at face value  therefore your claim 
not to read minds has no credibility with me sorry   I also note that 
you fail to answer my question  It just looks to me very much like
you have an axe to grind  especially as you are indeed ignoring what 
most Protestants say  which is stop the killing  The people you
refer to are properly described as Unionists not Protestants

As for their position of privilege what is that if not religion
based

It is based on politics bigotry and heartless extremism  None of these
things are synonymous with religion though there is certainly some
overlap
