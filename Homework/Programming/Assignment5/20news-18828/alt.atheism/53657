  die for a lie  Wouldnt people be able to tell if he was a liar  
 
 I light of yesterdays events in Waco Texas I guess the answer to your
 questions are very obvious  If you think Waco is just one example think
 back to 1972 in Jonestown where more than 900 people died for a lie

killed  In the end they did die for a lie but some not out of
conviction alone  Thought I try to make this point clear
