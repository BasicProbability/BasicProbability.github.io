 Great respect or love for a particular person does not equal a form of
 theism

Hmm  What about Jesus

Sure a person could have great respect for Jesus and yet be an 
atheist  Having great respect for Jesus does not necessarily mean 
that one has to follow the Christian or Muslim interpretation of 
his life
