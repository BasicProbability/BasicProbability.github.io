Subject Re Atheism survey

I replied to this query via email but I think there are some
issues that are worth discussing in public

 I am doing research on atheism part of which involves field research here
 on the net  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
 group intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief

I would recommend you to take a look at

1 your dictionary
2 altatheism FAQ files

to notice that atheism is not a belief system and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief but a lack of belief in deities
I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue 

 First of all Ive tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
 variety of ways with varying amounts of detail its possible to give 
 succinct answers to most everything but theres enough here to keep most of 
 you typing for hours Im sure

IMHO this is a poor method to do any real survey although Im sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours

 Also I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system
 although I know some of you might contend that you dont have ANY beliefs
  but
 are skeptical towards everything  I understand but you know what I mean
 Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
 required to get the precise idea across  

No I do not know what you mean If you are surveying our individual
philosophies fine but thats not strictly atheism Atheism is not
just another godless version of the theistic explanations for life
the universe and everything It is not a belief system and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system

Once more Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities 
Do not twist the meaning or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on

Some comments on your questions

 What contact with other atheists have you had before and after and during
 your conversion to atheism  Certainly your involvement with altatheism
 counts  how have net discussions affected your beliefs  

I would also like to hear more about this Have we been able to convert
anyone

 Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
 means proofs of the nonexistence of God etc or was it perhaps at least 
 in part through other means alienation from mainstream religion etc  

This question contains a contradiction in terms Beliefs 
cannot be acquired rationally  if they could they would not be 
beliefs You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists  those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists they just think very little about religion It seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities

Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd  how can lack of belief be acquired When did I acquire
lack of belief in the Easter Bunny I did believe in Santa though 

 To what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your 
 beliefs What phenomena of the universe and of human existence anything
 from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human
 affairs do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs and where
 are they lacking as an explanatory method  

This question does not make any sense since atheism does not deal with
these issues  it is not a worldview or a philosophy or a belief system

Sigh why havent I seen a good wellthought survey in the Usenet
for three years and what is the point of doing surveys in the net
anyway Just to abstract some opinions
