I dont think youre right about Germany  My daughter was born there and
I dont think she has any German rights eg to vote or live there beyond the
rights of all EC citizens  She is a British citizen by virtue of
her parentage but thats not full citizenship  For example I dont think
her children could be British by virtue of her in the same way
 
 I am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an
 application for it It might require immigration to Germany but
 I am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable
 in this case

Nope Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws  The 
ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over 100 years 
automatically become citizens if they move to Germany but the
Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany cant
Its not a very good example to show citizenship without descent
