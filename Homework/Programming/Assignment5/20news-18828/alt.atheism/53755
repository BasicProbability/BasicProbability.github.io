I assume that you  say here a religious law is for the followers of the
religion That begs the question why the religion has the right to define
who is a follower even when the offenders disagree

No I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as
belonging to the religion when event being judged applies This
prevents situations in which someone is a member of a religion
who when charged claims that heshe was not a member of the
religion so they are free to go on as if nothing had happened
