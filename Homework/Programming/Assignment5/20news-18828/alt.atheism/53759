The latest news seems to be that Koresh will give himself up once hes
finished writing a sequel to the Bible

mathew

Writing the Seven Seals or something along those lines  Hes already
written the first of the Seven which was around 30 pages or so and has
handed it over to an assistant for PROOFREADING  I would expect any
decent messiah to have a builtin spellchecker  Maybe Koresh 20 will
come with one
