Dan Im concerned that you are in grave spiritual danger because of your
stubborn refusal to love and accept into your heart the Mighty Invisible
Pink UnicornNice parody deleted

I shall pray for you In fact brother I cast out the demon which binds you
in the Name of the Mighty Invisible Pink Unicorn Dan you must have faith

Then you better pray for me too because I believe that the Mighty
Invisibile Pink Unicorn does not exist One being cannot be both Pink
and Invisible The demon or should that be daemon that keeps me
from believing and saving my soul is named Logic
