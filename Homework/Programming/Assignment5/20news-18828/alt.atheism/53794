Wait  Are we talking about ethics or morals here
Is the distinction important
Yes

Well make it

Ethics deal with individuals  Morals deal with groups

Well our moral system seems to mimic the natural one in a number of ways
Please describe these number of ways in detail  Then explain the any
contradictions that may arise

Just look at how human behavior mimics animal behavior  I couldnt even
begin to list all of the similarities  Many of the dissimilarities are due
to our high intelligence

Please describe these number of ways in detail  Then explain any
contradictions that may arise

I dont know  What is wrong  Is it possible for humans to survive for
a long time in the wild  Yes its possible but it is difficult  Humans
are a social animal and that is a cause of our success
Define difficult

I dont understand what you dont understand

The sentence Yes its possible but it is difficult  Humans survived
in the wild for hundreds of thousands of years

No  As noted earlier lack of mating such as abstinence or homosexuality
isnt really destructive to the system  It is a worst neutral
So if every member of the species was homosexual this wouldnt be destructive
to the survival of the species

Most animals that exhibit homosexuality are actually bisexual

Answer the question Keith  Is homosexuality detrimental to the survival
of the species
