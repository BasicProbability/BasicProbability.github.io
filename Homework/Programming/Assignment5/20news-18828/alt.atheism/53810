 Merely a question for the basis of morality
 
 MoralEthical behavior  Societally acceptable behavior
 
 I disagree with these  What society thinks should be irrelevant  What the
 individual decides is all that is important
 
 This doesnt seem right  If I want to kill you I can because that is what I
 decide

Sounds as though you are confused between what I want and what
I think is morally right
