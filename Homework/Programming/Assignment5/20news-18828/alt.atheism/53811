 It has been asked why no counterfatwa has been issued against
 Khomeneis condemnation of Rushdies because of his Satanic Verses
 The reason is basically that the satanic verses from which Rushdie
 took his title are a serious matter not to be played around with by
 anyone who cares about Islam
 
 This shouldnt matter
 
 Thats your opinion which I am sorry to say is irrelevant
