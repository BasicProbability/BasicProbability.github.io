 The R Us thing is trademarked  I dont know if Charles
 Lazarus is dead or alive but Id be careful because with
 a name like Lazarus he might rise again just to start a
 lawsuit
 
 	The R Us is not trademarked but the Backwards R Us is I 
 believe

Yup I think youre right  My mistake  Now how do I make
an R backwards using a computer keyboard

Ill bet the gods know how this is altatheism after
all  Tell you what if all my Rs start coming out
backwards when I type from now on Ill become a believer

And thats not asking for miracles  If I asked for a miracle
Id ask for a real miracle like for Pat Buchanan to become
an outofthecloset drag queen  wellmaybe that wouldnt be
so miraculous but I think hed look fabulous in a feather
boa and a sequined hat like Mia Farrow wore in Gatsby
