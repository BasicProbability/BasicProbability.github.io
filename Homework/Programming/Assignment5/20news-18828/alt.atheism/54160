 But this just shows then that painful execution is not considered 
 cruel and unusual punishment This shows that cruel as used in the 
 constitution does NOT refer to whether or not the punishment causes physical 
 pain
 Rather it must be a different meaning
 
 I dont think so  Although some forms of execution are painful the electric
 chair looks particularly so I think the pain is relatively shortlived
 Drawing and quartering on the other hand looks very painful and the
 victim wouldnt die right away hed bleed to death Id imagine

So what do we have now an integral over pain X time

I get to lash you with a wet noodle for ever but I only get to
cut you up with a power saw if Im quick about it
