 You take LSD and it skews your perception of reality You come down
 and your perceptions unskew

Ive never taken LSD but read about the strange lifes and times
of the Ashbury Heights culture Something that was usually profound
was the way these LSD trippers mentioned that after their first trip
they changed their view of the world In other words taking LSD would 
change their reference frames Which would indicate that deep changes
due to let us say rewiring of the brain temporarily will indeed
change frames And this leads to the statement that there is no
solid reference frame the LSD trippers modified their relative 
view

Much of the HaightAshbury crowd probably had preexisting 
dissatisfactions with their lives  dissatisfactions ameliorated by
mumbojumbo about new realities The only change I experienced after 
LSD was to gain the knowledge that I didnt enjoy how LSD twisted my
perception
