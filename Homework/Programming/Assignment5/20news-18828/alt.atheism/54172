re Conners questioning of the blissful afterlife as a reason why many
joined the early Xian church

Well as I remember Jacobys Mythmaker talks about this to cite
one source  but Im not sure if all Christians have read this book
In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated
as a Lutheran having a lot of Christian friends and I even
have played in two Christian rock bands

Do you mean Hyam Maccobys The Mythmaker
