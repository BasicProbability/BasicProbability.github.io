        FBI officials said cult leader David Koresh may have 
         forced followers to remain as flames closed in Koreshs 
         armed guard may have injected as many as 24 children with 
         poison to quiet them

Do the FBI have proof of this yet
 
    Why ask me I am only quoting the FBI official Why not ask the FBI
 
 Myabe theyre lying to cover up or maybe theyre telling the truth

The 24 children were of course killed by a lone gunman in a second story
window who fired eight bullets in the space of two seconds
