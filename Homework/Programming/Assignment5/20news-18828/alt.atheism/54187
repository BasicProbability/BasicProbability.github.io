 What is the difference between a chemist and someone who is taught
 Chemistry at say Cambridge University
 
 Put like this I cant answer I was originally pointing out that your
 attitude seemed to be I dont know if it really was that chemists
 tend to ignore all kinds of effects

When theyre not important yes  All scientists do  Otherwise science would
never get anywhere

                                     your original posting stated that
 when doing chemistry it is common to ignore atomic interactions

Hang about  not atomic interactions in general  Just specific ones which
are deemed unimportant  Like gravitational interactions between ions which
are so small theyre drowned out by electrostatic effects and so on

 Has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years
 
 Perhaps this revolution has yet to reach Cambridge my now Ill get
 flamed for sure 

Oh probably  They still make people memorize equations and IR spectra 
Maybe in a few decades theyll discover the revolutionary data book
technique


Bitter and twisted mathew
