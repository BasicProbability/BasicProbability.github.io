14 bits per RGB gives horrible machbanding visible in almost any picture

5 bits per RGB 32768 65000 colors gives visible machbanding

colorgradient picture has almost no machbanding This colorresolution is 

see some small machbanding on the smooth colorgradient picture but all in all
There ARE situiations where you get visible machbanding even in
a 24 bit card If
you create a very smooth color gradient of darkgreenwhiteyellow
or something and turn
up the contrast on the monitor you will probably see some machbanding

    While I dont mean to damn Henriks attempt to be helpful here
hes using a common misconception that should be corrected

    Mach banding will occur for any image  It is not the color
quantization you see when you dont have enough bits  It is the
human eyes response to transitions or edges between intensities
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side

Yeah of course The term mach banding was not the correct one it shouldve
been color quantization effect Although a bad color quantization effect could
result in some visible machbands on a picture that was smooth before it was
quantizised
