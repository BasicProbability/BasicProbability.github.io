Subject Re Fractals what good are they

In article 7155pdxgateUUCP idrrigelcspdxedu Ian D Romanick writes
 One thing  a small change in initial conditions can cause a huge
 change in final conditions  There are certain things about the way
 the plate tektoniks and volcanic activity effect a land scape that
 is while not entirely random unpredictable  This is also true with
 fractals so one could also conclude that you could model this
 fractally 

Yeah and its also true most long complicated sequences of events
calculations or big computer programs in general  I dont argue
that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals I
just question whether you should

The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
cant model should be replaced with a random number generator  That
has been useful for instance in making data more palatable to human
perception or for torture testing the rest of the system but I dont
think it has much to do with fractals and I certainly would rather
that the model be improved in a more explicable manner

I guess I just havent seen all these earthshaking fractal models
that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists  I
really hope I do but Im not holding my selfsimilar breath

 There is one other thing that fractals are good for  fractal
 image compression

Uh huh  Ill believe it when I see it  Ive been chasing fractal
compression for a few years and I still dont believe in it  If its so
great how come we dont see it competing with JPEG  Cause it cant
Ill wager

Actually I have wagered I quit trying to make fractal compression
work and I was trying because I dont think its a reasonable
alternative to other techniques  It is neat though 

Ill reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal  Thats why I
dont think fractal compression as it is widely explained is
practical  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their
sleeves that make their demos work but I dont see anyone using it in a
real product  Its been six years since Iterated Systems was formed
right

	There are always going to be questions until theres a product
	out there Sloan replies  The company plans to ship its first
	encoding devices in the summer he says  In March Iterated
	Systems will have the other half of the system the decoders
