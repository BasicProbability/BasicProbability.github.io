Subject Re QuickTime movie available

 Ive used the recentlyreleased Macintosh application MPEG to QuickTime to
 convert the excellent MPEG canyonmpg into a QuickTime movie  While
 anyone who would want this movie is perfectly able to convert it
 themselves I thought Id let the net know that Id be glad to mail copies
 of mine out  The movie conversion took close to SIX HOURS on my poor
 little IIcx in other words unless youve got a Quadra you might not want
 to tie up your machine in converting this file
 
 The movie is a fast flythrough of a fractalgenerated canyon landscape 
 The movie is 58 seconds long and uses the compact video compressor ie
 QuickTime v15  The movie looks okay on 8bit displays and looks
 absolutely awesome on 16 and 24bit displays
 
 Id be happy to mail this movie to the first 20 or so people who ask for
 it  The only caveat is you need to be able to receive a ninemegabyte mail
 message the movie was stuffited down to seven megs but binhex ruined
 that party  If more then 20 people want this movie then its just more
 evidence that the net needs a dedicated QuickTime FTP archive site  Cmon
 someones gotta have a spare 12GB drive out there

Okay Ive received a whole lot of requests for the movie so for
simplicitys sake I cant mail out any more than Ive already received as
of 1630 EDT Tuesday  Maybe itll pop up on a site sooner or later
