 According to the TIFF 50 Specification the TIFF version number
 bytes 23 42 has been chosen for its deep philosophical 
 significance
 Last week I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy
 Is this actually how they picked the number 42

Im sure it is and I am not amused  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec it infuriates me and Im none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway because I think their arbitrary but
carefully chosen number is neither  Additionally I find their
choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves why
not just use the letters TIFF

And no I dont think they should have bothered to support both word
orders either and Ive found that many TIFF readers actually
dont
