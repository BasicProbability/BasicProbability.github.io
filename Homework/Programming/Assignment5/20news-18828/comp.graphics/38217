 Greetings
 
 Does anybody know if it is possible to set VGA graphics mode to 640x400
 instead of 640x480  Any info is appreciated

Some VESA bioss support this mode 0x100  And any VGA should be able to
support this 640x480 by 256 colors since it only requires 256000 bytes
My 8514a VESA TSR supports this its the only VESA mode by card can support
due to 8514a restrictions A WDParadise
