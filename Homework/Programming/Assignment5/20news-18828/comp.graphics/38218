 Anyone know about the Weitek P9000 graphics chip
 Micron is selling it with their systems They rank them at 50 winmarks
 Any info would help
 thanks

Its supposedly a highperformance chip based upon workstation graphics
accelerators  Its quite fast I have 7 but as usual with new boardschips
the drivers are buggy for Windows  As far as Winmarks go it depends upon
the version  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 311  25 yielded the
50 number  Ive also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 from memory
as well

As far as the lowlevel stuff goes it looks pretty nice  Its got this
quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points

Its very fast but beware of buggy drivers and otherwise no nonwindows
support


I am not responsible for anything I do or say  Im just an opinion
