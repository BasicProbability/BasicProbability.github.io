Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is
Is there any reference to it 
Is it useful for creating 3D objects If yes whats the advantage

It is used to create a TIN triangulated irregular network which is
basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of
points  What is special about it is that the triangles formed are the 
most equalateral possible  Check out Proceedings of AutoCarto N where
N is 810  Sorry I dont have a specific reference describing the
process
