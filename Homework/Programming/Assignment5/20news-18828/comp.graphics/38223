Is there a collection of forms routines that can be used with curses
If so where is it located

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box Ive got lform lmenu and lpanel for
use with the curses library  Guess what they provide 

Unix Press ie PrenticeHall has a programmers guide for these
tools referred to as the FMLI Forms Mgmt Language Interface and
ETI Extended Terminal Interface now in its 2nd edition  It is
ISBN 0130206377

Paraphrased from the outside back cover

    FMLI is a highlevel programming tool for creating menus forms
    and text frames  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window panel menu and form manipulation

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation  It consists of a
shelllike environment of the fmli program and its database
files  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual

The ETI are subroutines part of the 3X manual section provide
support for a multiwindow capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library
