There is a new product for the IBMers out there it is called
IMAGINE and it just started shipping yesterday I can personally attest that it will blow the doors off of 3DStudio  It is made by IMPUlSE and is in its
3rd version1st for the IBM it can do morphing your standard keyframming animation it is a raytracer reflections  shadows and can doapply special FX to objects like ripple explode bounce things of that nature  Also it has algorithmic texture mapsand your standard brushmapping also

you can have animated brushmapsie live video mapped on the objs
also animated backdrops ie live video backgrounds
also animted reflections maps

you get the idea it will run for about 500 retail I think

dont let the low price fool you this product can do it all when it
comes to 3Danimation and Renderering
