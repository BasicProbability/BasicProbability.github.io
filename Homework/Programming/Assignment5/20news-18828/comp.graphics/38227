 Greetings
 
 Does anybody know if it is possible to set VGA graphics mode to 640x400
 instead of 640x480  Any info is appreciated

Some VESA bioss support this mode 0x100  And any VGA should be able to
support this 640x480 by 256 colors since it only requires 256000 bytes
My 8514a VESA TSR supports this its the only VESA mode by card can support
due to 8514a restrictions A WDParadise


I am not responsible for anything I do or say  Im just an opinion

	Ahh no  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
calculator  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is
307200 which is 300k to be exact  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I
dont think it is a BIOS mode  I wouldnt bet that all VGA cards can do
that either  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and
640x480  That by definition is SVGA though not very high SVGA
