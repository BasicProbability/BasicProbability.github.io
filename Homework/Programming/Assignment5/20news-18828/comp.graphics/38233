Subject Re looking for circle algorithm faster than Bresenhams

 I have an algorithm similar to Bresenhams line drawing algorithm that
 draws a line by stepping along the minor axis and drawing slices like
 AAAA BBBB CCCC in the following diagram
 
      AAAA
          BBBB
              CCCC
 

	Yes thats known as Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for
Incremental lines See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics
SpringerVerlag Berlin Heidelberg 1985

 I have tried to extrapolate this to circles but I cant figure out
 how to determine the length of the slices Any ideas

	Hmm I dont think I can help you with this but you might
take a look at the following

	DoubleStep Incremental Generation of Lines and Circles

	DoubleStep Generation of Ellipses X Wu and J G Rokne
