Subject Polygon Reduction for Marching Cubes


Dear Reader


Iam searching for an implementation of a polygon reduction algorithm
for marching cubes surfaces I think the best one is the reduction algorithm
from Schroeder et al SIGGRAPH 92 So is there any implementation of this 
algorithm it would be very nice if you could leave it to me

Also Iam looking for a fast  connectivity
test for marching cubes surfaces

Any help or hints will be very useful
Thanks a lot
