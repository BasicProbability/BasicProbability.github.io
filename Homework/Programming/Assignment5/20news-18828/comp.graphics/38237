I have posted a DOS MPEG decoderplayer to altbinariespicturesutilities

Here is a short description and some technical information taken from the
accompanying documentation


                              DMPEG V10

                       Public Domain MPEG decoder

                           by Stefan Eckart


0 Features


DMPEGDMPLAY is another MPEG decoderplayer for the PC


  decodes nearly the full MPEG video standard
   IPB frames frame size up to at least 352x240 supported

  saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display

  optional onscreen display during decoding requires VGA

  several dithering options ordered dither FloydSteinberg grayscale

  colorspace selection

  runs under DOS 640KB RAM no MSWindows required

  very compact small code  small data models 16 bit arithmetic

  real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
   VGA and many SuperVGAs



4 Technical information


The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec 1
The IDCT is based on the ChenWang 13 multiplication algorithm 2
not quite the optimum I know Blocks with not more than eight nonzero
coefficients use a nonseparated direct multiplyaccumulate 2DIDCT
sounds great doesnt it which turned out to be faster than a fast
algorithm in this quite common case Dithering is pretty standard Main
difference to the Berkeley decoder except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors the default option to
use a restricted colorspace and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither This leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image I claim judge yourself

Restricted colorspace means that the U and V components are clipped to
025 instead of 05 and the display colorspace points are distributed
over this restricted space Since the distance between colorspace points
is thus reduced by a factor of two the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors

Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation This yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve
on NTSC The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas
