Subject POV reboots PC after memory upgrade

Up until last week I have been running POVray v10 on my 48633 under DOS5
without any major problems  Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to
8Meg and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5  I had
a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win31 on the same system
and it now works fine even if a lot slower  I would like to go back to 
using POVray directly under DOS anyone any ideas
