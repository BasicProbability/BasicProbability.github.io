Subject Re looking for circle algorithm faster than Bresenhams

Graeme 	Yes thats known as Bresenhams Run Length Slice Algorithm for
Graeme Incremental lines See Fundamental Algorithms for Computer Graphics
Graeme SpringerVerlag Berlin Heidelberg 1985

 I have tried to extrapolate this to circles but I cant figure out
 how to determine the length of the slices Any ideas

Graeme 	Hmm I dont think I can help you with this but you might
Graeme take a look at the following

Graeme 	DoubleStep Incremental Generation of Lines and Circles
Graeme X Wu and J G Rokne Computer Graphics and Image processing
Graeme Vol 37 No 4 Mar 1987 pp 331334

Graeme 	DoubleStep Generation of Ellipses X Wu and J G Rokne
Graeme IEEE Computer Graphics  Applications May 1989 pp 5669

Another paper you might want to consider is
