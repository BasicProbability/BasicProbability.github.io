I am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a 
polygon Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing
information on the subject 

See the article An Efficient RayPolygon Intersection p 390 in
Graphics Gems ISBN 0122861655  The second step intersecting the
polygon does what you want  There is sample code in the book
