 which have equal first and last control points V1  W1 V4  W4 How do I 
 get upper bound for distance between these curves 

Which distance The distance between one point t  ti on the first curve
and a point on the other curve with same parameter u  ti

 
 Any references appreciated Thanks in anvance
