Subject Re Point within a polygon

scrowehemelbullcouk Simon Crowe writes

I am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a 
polygon Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing
information on the subject 

Well its been a while since this was discussed so i take the liberty of
reprinting without permission so sue me Eric Haines reprint of the very
interesting discussion of this topic

Give a man a fishing rod and hell laze around fishing and never do anything

With that in mind I reprint without permission so sue me relevant
information posted some years ago on this very problem  Note the early use of
PostScript technology predating many of this years papers listed in the
April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago

  I need to find a formulaalgorithm to determine if a line intersects
  a polygon  I would prefer a method that would do this in as little
  time as possible  I need this for use in a forward raytracing
  program

I think that this is a very difficult problem  To start with lines and
polygons are semialgebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points  Here are a few offthecuff ideas

First we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated  Now the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open and thus noncompact regions  Thus the line lies
completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon
or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon

Now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so
this is a decision problem  One possibility the decision model approach is
to reduce the question to some other well known problem Q and then try to
solve Q  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem

In recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript  See PostScript Language by Adobe Systems
Incorporated ISBN  0201101793 co 1985

So given a line L and a polygon P we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P and then outputs the answer  By
output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q and thus
the original problem

There are two small problems with this approach 

	1 There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q  So we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice or equivalently Zorns Lemma  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days

	2 More importantly the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper or in
	other words will it halt

	Now PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do thus the halting problem for PostScript is
	undecidable  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable


I wont even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite
precision and running out of ink paper or both

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests he should know
better hes hung around The Labs for long enough  By the well known
DobbinDullman reduction see J Dullman  D Dobbin J Comp Obfusc
37ii  pp 33947 lemma 17a linepolygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit without the use of Grobner bases so LPI to coin an
acronym is probably only NPcomplete  Besides Turingcompleteness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray3 is delivered since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds with scattergather



From debsvaxcscornelledu David Baraff

Well sure its no worse than NPcomplete but thats ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its
second derivative  I think theres an 89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that
deals with this
