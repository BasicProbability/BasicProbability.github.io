garbouwasafi or one of its many mirrors has a file
called svgabg40 in the programming subdirectory
These are svga bgi drivers for a variety of cards

from the README
Card types supported SuperVGA drivers
  Ahead ATI Chips  Tech Everex Genoa Paradise Oak Trident both 8800 
  and 8900 9000 Tseng both 3000 and 4000 chipsets and Video7
  These drivers will also work on video cards with VESA capability
  The tweaked drivers will work on any registercompatible VGA card
