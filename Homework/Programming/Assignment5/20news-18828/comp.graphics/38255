 According to the TIFF 50 Specification the TIFF version number
 bytes 23 42 has been chosen for its deep philosophical 
 significance
 Last week I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy
 Is this actually how they picked the number 42

Im sure it is and I am not amused  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec it infuriates me and Im none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway because I think their arbitrary but
carefully chosen number is neither  Additionally I find their
choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves why
not just use the letters TIFF

And no I dont think they should have bothered to support both word
orders either and Ive found that many TIFF readers actually
dont

ab

Why so up tight  FOr that matter TIFF6 is out now so why not gripe
about its problems  Also if its so important to you volunteer to
help define or critique the spec

Finally a little numerology  42 is 24 backwards and TIFF is a 24 bit
image format

I get paid for my opinions but that doesnt mean that UNC or anybody
                     else agrees with them
