Subject ReactionDiffusion techniques

This past week Ive been playing with some of the RD Reaction
Diffusion not to be confused with RDS or RD techniques
from SIGGRAPH 91

I was wondering what material is available to explain the control
mechanism a little more  It seems to me very much like a matter of
picking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting  Although
both of the papers Turk and Witkin  Kass were very well organized
and extremely helpful I guess what I need is a more basic description
of the technique especially wrt the control mechanisms  The tests
that I did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become
unstable

Is there any info available online  Source code would be great but
not necessary

Thanks
