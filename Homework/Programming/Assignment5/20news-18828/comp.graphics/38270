Subject Raytracers which is best

Hi all
	Ive just recently become seriously hooked on POV but there are a few
thing that I want to do that POV wont do penumbral shadows dispersion
etc I was just wondering what other sharewarefreeware raytracers are
out there and what can they do Ive heard of Vivid and Polyray and 
Rayshade and so on but Id rather no wade through several hundred pages of 
manual for each trying to work out what their capabilities are Can anyone
help A comparison of tracing speed between each program would also be 
mucho useful
