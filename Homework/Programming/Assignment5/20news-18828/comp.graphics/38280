Subject Chosing optimal colors for colormap 

Hi

  Im looking for an algorithm that would generate a good crosssection of
RGB colours given a limited colour map size 

The problem Im writing an application for the PC that may have at most 256
colors I want to use one colormap palette for the application but Id like
it to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum I could use 
a 6x6x6 RGB cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost
identical to the human eye 

Does anyone know how I can optimize my choice of colors
