Subject Re MPEG for xwindows MONO needed

On sunsiteuncedu in pubmultimediautilitiesunix find 
 mpegplay20tarZ

I find for mono it works best as mpegplay dither threshold 
   though you can use            mpegplay dither mono

Face it this is not be the best viewing situation

Also someone has made a patch for mpegplay that gives two more mono
modes  mono2 and halftone

They are by janpandoniacanberraeduau Jan Newmarch
And the patch can be found on csccanberraeduau 1379211 under
pubmotifmpeg20monopatch
