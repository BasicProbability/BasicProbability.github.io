Subject Re Virtual Reality for X on the CHEAP

Has anyone got multiverse to work 

I have built it on 486 svr4 mips svr4s and Sun SparcStation

There seems to be many bugs in it  The dogfight and dactyl simply do nothing
After fixing a bug where a variable is defined twice in two different modules  One needed
setting to static  else the client coredumped
