Subject Round VS Elliptical DOT Screens

When using Photoshop is there anyway to get an elliptical dot for the
halftone screen rather than a round dot  My printer would prefer an
elliptical dot but Im not sure how to set it up Im sending from a Mac
IIci to a Linotronic L300 imagesetter and I am using Photoshop 201 to
make my separations

Any help would be greatly appreshed TIA
