Subject SGI sales practices Was Crimson Was Kubota Announcement

The original posting complained 1 about SGI coming out with newer and
better architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones
and 2 that DEC did

No  Thats not what I was complaining about nor did I intend to
suggest that DEC was any better than SGI let me tell you about the
Lynx some day but be prepared with a large sedative if you do  My
comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors
that supported OpenGL rather than deal further with SGI

What I am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck

Im also annoyed about being sold several Personal IRISes at a
previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around
for a while rather than being flushed

Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that I found myself
pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
just before the end of the quarter but Im just a little tired of
getting boned in the process

Maybe its because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies so we
arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids NASA
for instance are  This lab and I suspect that a lot of other labs
and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers
every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis
The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  That
means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one
previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other
vendor  Im going to be looking at this box for the next five years
And every time I look at it Im going to think about SGI and how I
could have better spent my money actually your money since were
supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars

Now youll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a
corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts
