Subject Re Please Recommend 3D Graphics Library For Mac

 Robert G Carpenter writes

 Hi Netters
 
 Im building a CAD package and need a 3D graphics library that can handle
 some rudimentry tasks such as hidden line removal shading animation etc
 
 Can you please offer some recommendations
 
 Ill also need contact info name address email if you can find it
 
 Thanks
 
 Please Post Your Responses in case others have same need

The following is extracted from sumexaimstanfordedu  It should also be on
the mirrors  I think there is source for some applications that may have some
bearing on your project  Poke around the source directory  Ive never used
this package nor do I know anyone who did but the price is right 

Hope this helps

Subject 3d GrafSys 121 in incoming directory
A 3d GrafSys short description follows

Programmers 3D GrafSys Vers 121 now available 

Version 121 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C I PROMISE The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys If you have problems feel free 
to contact me
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster

Those of you who dont know what all this is about read on



Programmers 3D GrafSys  What it is


Didnt you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing threedimensional scenes 

Didnt you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of threedimensional molecules

And didnt the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is Yes but what has it to 
do with this package  read on

GrafSys is a THINK PascalC library that provides you with simple routines 
for building saving loading as resources and manipulating 
independent rotating around arbitrary achses translating and scaling 
three dimensional objects Objects not just simple singleline drawings

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping animation and some primitive hidden
linehiddensurface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections If you cant understand a word dont worry this is just showing
off for those who know about it The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you dont have to worry about that if you dont want to

GrafSys 111 comes in two versions One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors The other version uses fixedpoint arithmetic and runs on any Mac
Both versions are 100 source compatibel 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an objectclass library 
However I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select OOPGuild

GrafSys is free for any noncommercial usage Read the documentation enclosed


Enjoy
Christian Franz
