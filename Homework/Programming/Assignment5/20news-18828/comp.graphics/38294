Subject Re Fonts in POV

In Article 1qg9fcet9wampyrccuoweduau g9134255wampyrccuoweduau Coronado Emmanuel Abad says
 
 
 	I have seen several raytraced scenes from MTV or was it 
 RayShade with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image
 The fontschars had color depth and even textures associated with
 them  Now I was wondering is it possible to do the same in POV
 
 
 Thanks

Yes there are serveral programs which can convert font files eq the Borland
fonts to objects consisting of spheres cones etc 
Ive used a program forgot its nameplace but i can look for it which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers Vivid POV and
Polyray which i like more more flexibelfasteruse of expressions etc
The program has a lot nice features
So if interested give me a mail
