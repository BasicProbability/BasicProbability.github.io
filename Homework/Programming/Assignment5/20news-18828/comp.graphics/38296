Subject Re HOT NEW 3D Software


I dont have nor Imagine nor Real 3d but as old
Amiga user I think you should take a look also to 
Real 3d 20 for the Amiga I saw Imagine 20 on the
Amiga for a long time at my friends home and
Ive seen R3D 20 in action at BitMovie 93 in Riccione
Italy an Italian Computer Graphics Contest
Many professionals using 3d Studio on PC SoftImage
for Silicon Graphics and Imagine on the Amiga were 
VERY IMPRESSED by the power of this programs
Sorry Ive lost the posting with full description 
of features of this great program

For more informations give a look in compsysamigagraphics

Representative of Activa International told me that
it will be out in 2 weeks for the Amiga and that
PC MSWindows Silicon Indigo and Unix version are 
under development

Ciao
	Sergio
