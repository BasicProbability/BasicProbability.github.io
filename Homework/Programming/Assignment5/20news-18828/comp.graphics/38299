Subject Need help with Mitsubishi P78U image printer

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it  We bought this thing because it 1 has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and 2 claimed to print 256 gray
level images  However the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bitpixel images  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an HewlettPackard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bitpixel images just fine  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs  This was not mentioned in the sales literature  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bitpixel 64 level images in parallel mode but
they didnt have any information about how to program it to do so and they
would call Japan etc

Frankly I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bitpixel images
from the video source it cant store 8 bitspixel in the memory  Its not
like memory is that expensive any more  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bitpixel or even 8 bitpixel images out of this thing I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me

Thanks
