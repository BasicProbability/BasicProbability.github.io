Subject Need graph displayedit

I am looking for a program that is capable of displaying a graph
with nodes and links and with the possibility to edit interactively
the graph  add one node change one link etc

Actually a very simple X11 program would be ok all I need is to
put some boxes ie the nodes  on a pane and be able to
manipulate them with the mouse move add or delete boxes

Does anyone know if such program is available 
Thanks for any help
