   And CDIs CPU doesnt help much either  I understand it is
a 68070 supposedly a variation of a 6800068010 running at something
like 7Mhz  With this speed you truly need sprites

Wow A 68070 Id be very interested to get my hands on one of these
especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
68060 which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup 8D

Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
earlier post is plain old Quicktime 15 with the Compact Video codec
Ive seen digitized video some of Apples early commercials to be
precise running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely 16bit
color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC
processor should be able to approach fullscreen fullmotion animation
though as youve implied the processor will be taxed more with highly
dynamic material
