Subject Point of intersection of n lines

Hi

Can anybody suggest robust algorithmscode for computing the point of intersection
on n 2d lines in a plane The data has outliers and hence a simple least squares
technique does not seem to provide satifactory results

Please respond by email and I will post the summary to the newsgroups
if there is sufficient interest

Thanks
