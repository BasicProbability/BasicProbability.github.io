Subject Re cylinder and ray


Sketch  Rotate so cylinder axis is  Z axis

Intersect XY projection of line with projected cylinder similar to
but easier than sphere intersection  Result no intersection one
intersection or two intersections parameterized along line by t0 and
t1  Now look at Z and compute intersections of line with top and
bottom planes of cylinder  This gives t0 and t1  The interval of
intersection is then the bit of the line from t0t1 INTERSECT t0t1

Details left as an exercise for the reader
