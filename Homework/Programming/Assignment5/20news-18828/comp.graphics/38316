Subject VGA Mode 13h Routines Available

Hi there

Ive made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP  I originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself but perhaps someone
here will find them useful  They are certainly useable as they are but
are missing some higherlevel functionality  Theyre intended more as an
intro to mode 13h programming a starting point

 The library assumes a 386 processor but it is trivial to modify it
 for a 286  If enough people ask Ill make the mods and repost it as a
 different version

The routines are written in assembly TASM and are callable from C  They
are fairly simple but Ive found them to be very fast for my purposes
anyway  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h define a
virtual screen put and get pixels put a pixmap rectangular image with
no transparent spots put a sprite image with seethru areas copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory etc  Ive also included a
simple C routine to draw a line as well as a C routine to load a 256
color GIF image into a buffer  I also wrote a quickndirtytm demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three windows

The whole package is available on spangcamosunbcca in pubdosvglzip 
It is zipped with pkzip 204g

It is completely in the public domain as far as Im concerned  Do with
it whatever you like  However itd be nice to get credit where its due
and maybe an email telling me you like it if you dont like it dont bother
