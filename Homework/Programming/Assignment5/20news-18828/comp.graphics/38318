Subject Re Please Recommend 3D Graphics Library F

Sorry about not mentioning platform my original post was to macprogrammer
and then decided to post here to compgraphics

Id like the 3D software to run on primarily Mac in either C Object Pascal
Think or MPW But Ill port to Windows later so a package that runs on
Mac and has a Windows version would be ideal

Im looking for a package that has low upfront costs and reasonable licensing
costs of course
