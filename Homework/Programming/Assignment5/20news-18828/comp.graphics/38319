Subject Re Sphere from 4 points

Boy this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ

Given 4 points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is
center and radius exactly fitting those points  I know how to do it
for a circle from 3 points but do not immediately see a 
straightforward way to do it in 3D  I have checked some
geometry books Graphics Gems and Farin but am still at a loss
Please have mercy on me and provide the solution  

Wouldnt this require a hypersphere  In 3space 4 points over specifies
a sphere as far as I can see  Unless that is you can prove that a point
exists in 3space that is equidistant from the 4 points and this may not
necessarily happen

Correct me if Im wrong which I quite possibly am
