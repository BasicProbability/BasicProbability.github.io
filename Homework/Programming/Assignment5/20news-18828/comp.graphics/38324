Subject Cobra 20 1b1 Video card HELP ME

Does ANYONE out there in Netland have any information on the Cobra 220 
card  The sticker on the end of the card reads
        Model Cobra 1B1
        Bios  Cobra v220

I Havnt been able to find anything about it from anyone  If you have 
any information on how to get a hold of the company which produces the 
card or know where any drivers are for it PLEASE let me know

As far as I can tell its a CGA card that is taking up 2 of my 16bit 
ISA slots but when I enable the test patterns it displays much more than 
the usualy 4 CGA colors At least 16 from what I can count Thanks
