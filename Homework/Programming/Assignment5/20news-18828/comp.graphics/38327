Subject Re Sphere from 4 points

Boy this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an FAQ
center and radius exactly fitting those points  I know how to do it
for a circle from 3 points but do not immediately see a 
straightforward way to do it in 3D  I have checked some
geometry books Graphics Gems and Farin but am still at a loss
Please have mercy on me and provide the solution  

Off the top of my head I might try

Given p1 p2 p3 p4

Find  pc center of sphere determined by p1  p4 
       distpc pi radius

pc is the same distance from our four points so
distpcp1  distpcp2  distpcp3  distpcp4 

Of course we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots
distsqpcp1  distsqpcp2  distsqpcp3  distsqpcp4 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula simplify and the 
x2c y2c and z2c terms cancel out leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns xc yc zc  
Solve using your favorite method  


All the best

 John
