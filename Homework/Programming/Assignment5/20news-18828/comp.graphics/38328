Wow A 68070 Id be very interested to get my hands on one of these
especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
68060 which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup 8D

The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by
the European partners of Motorola It has some integrated IO controllers
and half a MMU but otherwise its a 68010 Think of it the same as
the 8086 and 80186 were
