Subject Re VGA 640x400 graphics mode

 Some VESA bioss support this mode 0x100  And any VGA should be able to
 support this 640x480 by 256 colors since it only requires 256000 bytes
 My 8514a VESA TSR supports this its the only VESA mode by card can support
 due to 8514a restrictions A WDParadise

 	Ahh no  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
 calculator  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is
 307200 which is 300k to be exact  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I
 dont think it is a BIOS mode  I wouldnt bet that all VGA cards can do
 that either  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and
 640x480  That by definition is SVGA though not very high SVGA
 

Yes I did punch in the wrong numbers working too many late nites  I
intended on stating 640x400 is 256000 bytes  Its not in the bios just my
VESA TSR
