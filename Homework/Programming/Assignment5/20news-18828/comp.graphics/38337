Subject Automatic layout of state diagrams

Hi

Im hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science
project group We are doing computer science honours and our project
is to do a graphical simulator for a finite state automata

Basically the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar
showing circles for states and labeled arcs inbetween

The problem is working out the best way to layout the states and draw the
arcs inbetween so that as few arcs as possible cross each other

If anyone has any suggestionsalgorithmsbugfree ready to compile C code  
that might help us it would be much appreciated

Thanks in advance

Gregory
