Subject How do I compensate for photographic viewpoint and distortion

Hi to all out there  We have this problem and Im not certain Im solving it
in the correct way  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this or point
me in the right place to look

We have an Xray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole
passing through it at a right angle to the tubes axis

                                                          
                                                         image
                                                          
  Xray source                                          screen
                            metallic  tube              
                                                        
                                                          

We know sourcescreen centre distance radius of the tube radius of the hole

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen  However
the calculations are mathematically highly complex and must assume that the
objects hole projects an image resembling an ellipse if the tube is not
parallel to the screen in the centre of the screen  However it is unlikely
that the object is placed so conveniently  

Firstly we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse  I cannot
know what the angle between the tube and screen is  Do I have to assume that
they are parallel to do the transformation  How do I do this transformation

Secondly there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar
the sourcescreen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the
screen  How can I compensate the ellipses axis for this image distortion

So please can anyone give us a few pointers here  How do we transform the
image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen and how
do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen

Wed appreciate any help either posted or emailed

Thanks in advance Simon
