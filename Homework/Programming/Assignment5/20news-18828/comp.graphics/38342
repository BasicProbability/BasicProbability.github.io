Subject polygon orientation in DXF


Hi  Im writing a program to convert dxf files to a database
format used by a 3D graphics program Ive written  My program stores
the points of a polygon in CCW order  Ive used 3D Concepts a 
little and it seems that the points are stored in the order
they are drawn

Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the 
points are stored in CW or CCW  Its easy enough to convert
but if I dont know which way they are stored I dont know 
which direction the polygon should be visible from

If DXF doesnt handle this can anyone recommend a workaround
The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one
in the DXF file one stored CW and the other CCW  But that
doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed

Thanks in advance for any help
