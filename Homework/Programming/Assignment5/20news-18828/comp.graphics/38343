Subject Fractals What good are they 

We have been using Iterated Systems compression board to compress 
pathology images and are getting ratios of 401 to 701 without too
much loss in quality It is taking about 4 mins per image to compress
on a 25Mhz 486 but decompression is almost real time on a 386 in software 
alone
