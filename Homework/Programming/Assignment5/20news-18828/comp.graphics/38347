Subject Info needed 2D contour plotting

Hi Everyone

  Its spendthemoneybeforeitgoesaway time here at UFlorida
and we need to find some PCbased software that will do contour
plotting with irregular boundariesie a 2D profile of a soil
                                    system with a pond superimposed
                  on it  Weve given SURFER a
    POND                          trial run but it interpolates
                                  contours out into the pond andor
                        creates artifacts at the borders
              SOIL                If anyone out there knows of a
                                  product Ild appreciate hearing
  about it  If there is enough of
a response Ill post a summary  Thanks  and now back to lurking
