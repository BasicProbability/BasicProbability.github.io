Subject Re Sphere from 4 points


 From bolsoncarsonuwashingtonedu Edward Bolson

 Given 4 points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is
 cnter and radius exactly fitting those points

The equation of the sphere through the 4 points x1y1z1x4y4z4 is
   x2y2z2  x12y12z12    x42y42z42 
        x             x1                x4       
        y             y1                y4         0
        z             z1                z4       
        1             1                 1        
When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the
equation in the form
  Ax2y2z2  Bx  Cy  Dz  E  0
If you need the center and radius jyst divide through by A it cannot be
zero if the 4 given points form a nondegenerate tetrahedron and complete
the square on x y and z to obtain
  xxc2  yyc2  zzc2  r2
