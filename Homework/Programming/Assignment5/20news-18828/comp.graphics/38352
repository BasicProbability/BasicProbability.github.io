Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is
Is there any reference to it 
Is it useful for creating 3D objects If yes whats the advantage

There is a vast literature on Delaunay triangulations literally
hundreds of papers  A program is even provided with every copy of 
Mathematica nowadays  You might look at this if you are interested in 
using it for creating 3D objects
