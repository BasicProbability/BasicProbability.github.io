Subject GIF to BMP

Im not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question  If not
please forgive me and point me in the right direction

Does anybody know of a program that converts GIF files to BMP files
and if so where can I ftp it from  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated

Please respond via email as I do not read this group very often

ThanksScott
