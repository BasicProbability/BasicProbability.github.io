    Does anybody know if there are any good 2dgraphics packages
    available for IBM RS6000  AIX  Im looking for something
    like DECs GKS or HewlettPackards Starbase both of which
    have reasonably good support for different output devices
    like plotters terminals X etc

   Try graPHIGS from IBM It is an excellent package
