Subject PC fastest linecircle drawing routines HELP

hi all

IN SHORT looking for very fast assembly code for linecircle drawing
	  on SVGA graphics

COMPLETE
	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
graphics program to write on PC or clones ballandstick type

Reasons programs that Ive seen are far too slow for this purpose

Platform 386486 class machine
	  800x60016 or 1024x72816 VGA graphics
		speed is important 16color for nonrendering
		 purpose is enough may stay at 800x600 for
		 speed reason
         hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards  My own card is based on Trident 8900c not VESA

What Im looking for
1 fast very fast routines to draw linescirclessimpleshapes
   on abovementioned SVGA resolutions
   Presumably in assembly languagine
	Yes VERY FAST please
2 related codes to help rotatingzoominganimating the drawings on screen
   Drawings for beginning would be lines circles mainly think of
   text else later
   you know the way molecular graphics rotates zooms a molecule
2 and any other codes preferentially in C that can help the 
   project

Final remarks
nonprofit  expected to become share freeware

	Any help is appreciated
	thanks
