    And CDIs CPU doesnt help much either  I understand it is
 a 68070 supposedly a variation of a 6800068010 running at something
 like 7Mhz  With this speed you truly need sprites
 
 Wow A 68070 Id be very interested to get my hands on one of these
 especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
 68060 which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup 8D

   Sean the 68070 exists 

 
 Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
 earlier post is plain old Quicktime 15 with the Compact Video codec
 Ive seen digitized video some of Apples early commercials to be
 precise running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely 16bit
 color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC
 processor should be able to approach fullscreen fullmotion animation
 though as youve implied the processor will be taxed more with highly
 dynamic material

   Sean I dont want to get into a miniwar by what I am going to say
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris youll see why please noflames I reserve
those for csma  

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a
booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
15

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something  It played back quite
nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to 25x by
3xx 320 in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasnt 30fps or about 30fps anymore  It dropped to like 15 fps  Then he
increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 1012 fps 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra dont know
what model 900 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

   Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble  And this wasnt even from the hardisk  This was
from memory

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some
hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the 
animation like supposedly MacroMinds Accelerator

   Dont misunderstand me I just want to clarify this

   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not I can
claim 320x200 a tad more with overscan being done in 256000 colors in 
my computer not from the hardisk at 30fps with Scala MM210

   But I agree if we consider MPEG stuff I think a multimedia consumer
lowpriced box has a lot of market I just think 3DO would make it 
no longer CDI
