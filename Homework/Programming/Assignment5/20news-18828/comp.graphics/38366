 Im not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question  If not
 please forgive me and point me in the right direction

 Does anybody know of a program that converts GIF files to BMP files
 and if so where can I ftp it from  Any help would be greatly 
 appreciated

 Please respond via email as I do not read this group very often

 ThanksScott

Sorry Scott if you post it here you can read it here  There is a shareware
program available via anonymous FTP that will suit your needs  Youll find 
it at OAKOAKLANDEDU  in the subdirectory pubmsdosgraphics  The file is
called GRFWK61TZIP
