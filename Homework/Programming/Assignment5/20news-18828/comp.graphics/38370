The problem is not precisely defined above but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon then
you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon  There
are two ways to do this  use a somewhat tricky but bynow well
examined lineartime algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary
or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
routine and accept On log n  Both methods are discussed in
Preparata and Shamos for example
