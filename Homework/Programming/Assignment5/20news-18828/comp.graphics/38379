 Im building a CAD package and need a 3D graphics library that can handle
 some rudimentry tasks such as hidden line removal shading animation etc
 
 Can you please offer some recommendations

I think APDA has something called MacWireFrame which is a full
wireframe and supposedly hiddenline removal library
I think it weighs in at 99 but Ive been wrong on an order
of magnitude before

Libertarian atheist semianarchal TechnoRat
