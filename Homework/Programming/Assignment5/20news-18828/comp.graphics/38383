Sorry Bryan this is not quite correct Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with LinuxSLS It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode without Xwindows
So at least it is possible to write a GIF viewer under Linux However I dont
think that there exists a similar SVGA package and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice

No VGALIB  Amazing  I guess it was lost in all those subdirs 
Thanks for correcting me  It doesnt sound very appealing though only
320x200  Im glad it wasnt something major I missed

Thanks
