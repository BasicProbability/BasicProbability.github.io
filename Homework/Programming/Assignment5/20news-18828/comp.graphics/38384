 A stupid question but what will CView run on and where can I get it I
 am still in need of a GIF viewer for Linux Without XWindows
 Thanks
  
 
 Ho boy There is no way in HELL you are going to be able to view GIFs or do
 any other graphics in Linux without X windows  I love Linux because it is
 so easy to learn  You want text  Okay   Use Linux You want text AND
 graphics  Use Linux with X windows  Simple  Painless  REQUIRED to have
 X Windows if you want graphics  This includes fancy word processors like
 doc image viewers like xv etc
 

Sorry Bryan this is not quite correct Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with LinuxSLS It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode without Xwindows
So at least it is possible to write a GIF viewer under Linux However I dont
think that there exists a similar SVGA package and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice

Best Regards

Arno
