Subject Need specsinfo on Apple QuickTime

I need to get the specs or at least a very verbose interpretation of the
specs for QuickTime  Technical articles from magazines and references to
books would be nice too

I also need the specs in a format usable on a Unix or MSDOS system  I cant
do much with the QuickTime stuff they have on ftpapplecom in its present
format

Thanks in advance
