Subject MSWindows graphics viewer


Howdy all

	I was wondering if people could email me their opinions on
the various graphics viewers available for MSWindows 3x  Im
working on a project to set up our scanner and write documentation on
how to use it and it would be nice to have a snazzy image viewer 
to look at and maybe even edit the image you just scanned

The file formats Im looking for

GIF
JPEG
TIFF
PCX
whatever other major file formats there are

Thanks a lot for your help

Grant

In the days of old
When Knights were bold
	And women were too cautious
Oh those gallant days
When women were women
	And men were really obnoxious
