    And CDIs CPU doesnt help much either  I understand it is
 a 68070 supposedly a variation of a 6800068010 running at something
 like 7Mhz  With this speed you truly need sprites
snip
the 3DO is not a 68000
 
 Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
 earlier post is plain old Quicktime 15 with the Compact Video codec
 Ive seen digitized video some of Apples early commercials to be
 precise running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely 16bit
 color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC
 processor should be able to approach fullscreen fullmotion animation
 though as youve implied the processor will be taxed more with highly
 dynamic material

booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
15

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something  It played back quite
nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to 25x by
3xx 320 in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasnt 30fps or about 30fps anymore  It dropped to like 15 fps  Then he
increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 1012 fps 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra dont know
what model 900 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

   Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble  And this wasnt even from the hardisk  This was
from memory

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some
hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the 
animation like supposedly MacroMinds Accelerator

   Dont misunderstand me I just want to clarify this



The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor one or two custom graphics
chips a DSP a doublespeed CDROM and 2MB of RAMVRAM Im a little
fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAMVRAM capacity

It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in
Santa Monica CA From 3DO RJ Mical of AmigaLynx fame and Hal
Josephson sp were there to talk about the machine and their plan We
got to see the unit displaying fullscreen movies using the CompactVideo codec
which was nice very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft
 and a very high frame rate to boot like 30fps

Note however that the 3DOs screen resolution is 320x240

CompactVideo is pretty amazing I also wanted to point out that QuickTime
does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated
above Im sure if the material had been compressed at the large size
then it would play back fine I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit The
price of generality personally I dont use the dynamic sizing of movies
often if ever But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick
on the latest 040 machines

Im not sure how a Centris20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in
the 3DO box Obviously the ARM is faster but how much
