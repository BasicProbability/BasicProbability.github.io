This may be a fairly routine request on here but Im looking for a fast
polygon routine to be used in a 3D game

	A fast polygon routine to do WHAT

To draw polygons of course  Its a VGA mode 13h 320x200 game done in C and
ASM  I need a faster way to draw concave polygons that the method I have right
now which is very slow
