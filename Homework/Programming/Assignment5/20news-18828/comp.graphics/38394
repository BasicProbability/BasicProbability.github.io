Sorry Bryan this is not quite correct Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with LinuxSLS It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode without Xwindows
So at least it is possible to write a GIF viewer under Linux However I dont
think that there exists a similar SVGA package and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice

No VGALIB  Amazing  I guess it was lost in all those subdirs 
Thanks for correcting me  It doesnt sound very appealing though only
320x200  Im glad it wasnt something major I missed

Tommy Frandsens VGAlib which is probably what youre talking about
will do the standard VGA modes some tweaked modes and then the Tseng
ET4000 Super VGA modes I have an ET4000 and Im viewing GIFs at
640x480256 I have a lousysmall monitor with dpgview on Linux I
think I had to change some constants in the dpgview sources to make it
use the ET4k modes

VGAlibs sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA
support each mode is an array of register values and theres a program
that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current
mode Havent tried it though

Btw my version of VGAlib is 12
