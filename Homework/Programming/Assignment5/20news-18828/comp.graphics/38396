Subject Re Fake virtual reality

The most ridiculous example of VRexploitation Ive seen so far is the
Virtual Reality Clothing Company which recently opened up in Vancouver As
far as I can tell its just another chic clothes spot Although it would be
interesting if they were selling virtual clothing

Email me if you want me to dig up their phone  and you can probably get
some promotional lit
