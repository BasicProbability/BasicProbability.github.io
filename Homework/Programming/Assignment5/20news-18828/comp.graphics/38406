Subject Needed Plotting package that does

Looking for a graphicsCADorwhatever package on a XUnix box that will
take a file with records like

n  a  b  p

where n  a count   integer 
      a  entity a  string
      b  entity b  string
      p  type      string

and produce a networked graph with nodes represented with boxes or circles
and the vertices represented by lines and the width of the line determined by
n  There would be a different line type for each type of vertice The boxes
need to be identified with the entitys name  The number of entities  1000
and vertices  100000  It would be nice if the tool minimized line
crossovers and did a good job of layout  

  I have looked in the FAQ for compgraphics and gnuplot without success Any
ideas would be appreciated

Thanks
