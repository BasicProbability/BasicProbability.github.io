Subject Re MSWindows Screen Grabber summary


Hi again

Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS
Windows screen grabber  It proves to me AGAIN that the net is a 
wonderful thing  

So in summary

There are two choices

1	Various screen grabber packages Corel Draw has one there are
a couple on simtel and cica

2	Use the builtin PrintScreen and AltPrintScreen functionality
to paste the screen or window to the clipboard  Then paste the 
clipboard to your application  Cool

Again thanks for the info

Grant the MSWindows newbie  Unix and X are my bag
