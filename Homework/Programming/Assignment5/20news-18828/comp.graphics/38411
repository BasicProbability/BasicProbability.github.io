Subject TIFF NeXT Appsoft draw  GIF conversion

Okay all my friends are bitching at me that the map I made in Appsoft Draw
cant be displayed in xv I checked Its true at least with version
10  My readers on the NeXT have very little trouble on it Preview messes
up the eps but does fine with the TIFF and ImageViewer09a behaves with
flying colors except it doesnt convert worth   

  Please is there any way I can convert this drw from Appsoft 10 on the NeXT
to something more reasonable like gif  I have access to a sun4 and NeXTstep
30 systems  any good reliable conversion programs would be helpful please
email Ill post responses if anyone wants me to please email that to

Yes I used alphachannel god i could choke steve jobs right now  

Yes i know how to archie but tell me what to archie for 

Also is there a way to convert to ps plain format ImageViiewer09 turns
out nothing recognizable
