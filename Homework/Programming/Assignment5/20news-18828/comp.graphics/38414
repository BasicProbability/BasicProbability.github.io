I have the ATI GRAPHICS ULTRA PRO EISA version  I must admit it has 
received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had  

PC Magazine seems to be impressed with the ATI card in their most recent
reviews  In the April 13th issue they rate the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro
EISA version as their Editors Choice  They noted that the drivers
had improved since they tested the ISA version in January

Yeah  they also gave it their Editors Choice in the rundown of
graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue which is why
I bought and then returned mine  The only conclusion I can come up with
is that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness
of a video card than I do
