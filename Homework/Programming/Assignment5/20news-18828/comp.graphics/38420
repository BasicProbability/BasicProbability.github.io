Subject need algorithm for reading and displaying bitmap files

Im making a customized paint program in DOS and need an algorithm
for reading bitmap files like GIF PCX or BMP  Does anyone have
such an algorithm  Ive tried copying one out of a book for reading
PCX format but it doesnt work  I will take an algorithm for any
format that can be created from Windows Paint  
Thanks
Toni
