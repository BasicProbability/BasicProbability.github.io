Subject Wheres DMORF

	Could anyone direct me to the FTP site where I can find the DOSbased
morphing package called DMORF12ZIP  I had downloaded this file last week
but the new DOS 6 crashed my hard drive and I lost it Now I cant find the
site where I got it from

Also are there any other morphing packages out for DOS freeware or shareware


Thanks in advance
Barry
