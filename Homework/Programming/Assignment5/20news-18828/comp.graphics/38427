Subject Sphere from 4 points


Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets
of 3 points and intersecting the normals from there  This would also define
the circle center  However small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel


Having thought about this why dont you project the 2 lines onto the 2d
plane formed by the lines  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in
2D where youre guaranteed a unique solution unless theyre parallel which
wont happen in this case and then use parametric distance along the lines
from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest  This
bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d

Hope I havent put my foot in it again
