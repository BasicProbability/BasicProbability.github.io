  Ricardo the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
  earlier post is plain old Quicktime 15 with the Compact Video codec
  Ive seen digitized video some of Apples early commercials to be
  precise running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely 16bit
  color depth I would expect that using the same algorithm a RISC
  processor should be able to approach fullscreen fullmotion animation
  though as youve implied the processor will be taxed more with highly
  dynamic material


    Sean I dont want to get into a miniwar by what I am going to say
 but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
 claiming on the Centris youll see why please noflames I reserve
 those for csma  

    I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had a
 booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
 using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the spot
 quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
 15

That is in fact the current version it only came out in December

    They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something  It played back quite
 nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to 25x by
 3xx 320 in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
 wasnt 30fps or about 30fps anymore  It dropped to like 15 fps  Then he
 increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 1012 fps

    Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra dont know
 what model 900 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
 could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

    Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
 a little bit of trouble  And this wasnt even from the hardisk  This was
 from memory

My test movie was created at 320240 resolution it wasnt being scaled up
Scaling was a very CPUintensive operation with the original QuickTime 10
the current version has optimizations for ratios like 41 160120  320240
but even so Im prepared to believe that the performance isnt as good as
with playing back an actual 320240 movie I havent done any numerical
measurements for scaled playback
