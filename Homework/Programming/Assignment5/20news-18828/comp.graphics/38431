Im not sure how a Centris20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in
the 3DO box Obviously the ARM is faster but how much

Why would it have to be much faster it probably is  Assuming an ARM
is about as efficient as a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations doing
a CompactVideolike digital video codec is an easy task For Software
Motion Pictures which is a lot like Compact Video though it predates
it we get 48 framessec at 320x240 on a DECstation 5000200 That
machine has a 25 Mhz MIPS R3000
