Hello netters

Sorry I dont know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing
probably should be a CFV but since I dont have tha ability to create a 
news group myself I just want to start the discussion 

I enjoy reading cg very much but I often find it difficult to sort out what
Im interested in Everything from screendrivers graphics cards graphics
programming and graphics programs are discused here What Id like is a 
compgraphicsprogrammer news group
What do you other think

often disregarded Seldom you hear them beeing prized as seldom as you hear 
a seeing man prizeing what he sees Per Lagerkvist The Fist
