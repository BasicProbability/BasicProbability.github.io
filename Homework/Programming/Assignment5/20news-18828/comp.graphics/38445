Subject Re 24 bit Graphics cards

I am looking for EISA or VESA local bus graphic cards that support at least 
1024x786x24 resolution  I know Matrox has one but it is very
expensive All the other cards I know of that support that
resoultion are striaght ISA 

What about the ELSA WINNER4000 S3 928 Bt485 4MB EISA or the
Metheus Premier4VL S3 928 Bt485 4MB ISAVL 

Also are there any X servers for a unix PC that support 24 bits

As it just happens SGCS has a Xserver X386 14 that does
1024x768x24 on those cards Please email to infosgcscom for more
details
