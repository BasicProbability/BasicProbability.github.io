Subject Re Rumours about 3DO 

First off Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the
68070 I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for
further enhancements to the Motorola line rather than meted out to
another company Ah well I guess thats what I get when I assume the
computer industry will operate in a logical manner

   Sean I dont want to get into a miniwar by what I am going to say
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris youll see why please noflames I reserve
those for csma  

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show and Apple had
a
booth there  I walked by and they were showing realtime video capture
using a Radious or SuperMac card to digitize and make right on the
spot
quicktime movies  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
15

Version 15 of Quicktime is as has been stated the current version of
the software The older version is 10 and 16 is on the horizon in the
not too distant future

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something  It played
back quite
nicely and in real time  The guy then expanded the window resized to
25x by
3xx 320 in y I think and the frame rate decreased enough to notice
that it
wasnt 30fps or about 30fps anymore  It dropped to like 15 fps  Then
he
increased it just a bit more and it dropped to 1012 fps 

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies Apparently the process of expanding
each frames image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processorintensive There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size but if you drop to 19x
size or increase to 21x size performance suffers dramatically

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using He was using a Quadra
dont know
what model 900 to do it and he was telling the guys there that the
Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII

He lied  Quicktime is very CPU dependent He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine However an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture

   Well I spoiled his claim so to say since a 68040 Quadra Mac was
having
a little bit of trouble  And this wasnt even from the hardisk  This
was
from memory

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime or some
hardware assisted Centris or another software product running the 
animation like supposedly MacroMinds Accelerator

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 10  I
was using was 15 One of the new codecs in v15 allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 10 could handle
The Centris 650 I saw was a plainvanilla with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound and the software was Movie Player
the QT player Apple includes with the software

   Dont misunderstand me I just want to clarify this

No problem  it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the
things it does as well as it can
