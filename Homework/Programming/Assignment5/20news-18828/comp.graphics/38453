Look in the pubSPACE directory on amesarcnasagov  there are a number
of earth images there You may have to hunt around the subdirectories as
things tend to be filed under the mission ie APOLLO rather than under	
the image subject	

For those of you who dont need 24 bit I got a 32 colour Amiga IFF
of a cloudless Earth scanned Looks okay when mapped on a sphere
Email me and Ill send it you
