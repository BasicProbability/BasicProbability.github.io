Hello netters

Sorry I dont know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing
probably should be a CFV but since I dont have tha ability to create a 
news group myself I just want to start the discussion 

I enjoy reading cg very much but I often find it difficult to sort out what
Im interested in Everything from screendrivers graphics cards graphics
programming and graphics programs are discused here What Id like is a 
compgraphicsprogrammer news group
What do you other think

This sounds wonderful but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing
this or they dont have the power to do so  For example I would like
to see a compgraphics architecture like this

compgraphicsalgorithms2d
compgraphicsalgorithms3d
compgraphicsalgorithmsmisc
compgraphicshardware
compgraphicsmisc
compgraphicssoftwareapps

However that is almost overkill  Something more like this would probably
make EVERYONE a lot happier

compgraphicsprogrammer
compgraphicshardware
compgraphicsapps
compgraphicsmisc

It would be nice to see specialized groups devote to 2d 3d morphing
raytracing image processing interactive graphics toolkits languages
object systems etc but these could be posted to a relevant group or
have a mailing list organized

That way when someone reads news they dont have to see these subject
headings which are rather disparate

System specific stuff  should be under compsys or composprogrammer 

	Need help programming GL
	ModeX programming information
	Fast sprites on PC

Hardware technical stuff

	Speed of Weitek P9000
	Drivers for SpeedStar 24X

Applications oriented stuff

	VistaPro 30 help
	How good is 3dStudio
	Best image processing program for Amiga

Programming oriented stuff

	Fast polygon routine needed
	Good morphing alogirhtm wanted
	Best depth sort for triangles
	Which C library to get

I wish someone with the power would get a CFD and then a CFV going on
this stuffthis newsgroup needs it

Brian
