DETAILED DESCRIPTION


    Artists designers scientists engineers and educators share the
    problem of moving information from one mind to another
    Traditionally they have used pictures words demonstrations
    music and dance to communicate imagery  However expressing
    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well
    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far
    exceed their technical skills

    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression
    tools has compounded this problem  In hypermedia multimedia and
    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the
    observer or participant  Wading through a multitude of
    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar
    representions a confounded user asks What does it all mean

    Since image construction transmission reception decipherment and
    ultimate understanding are complex tasks strongly influenced by
    physiology education and culture and since electronic media
    radically amplify each processing step then we as electronic
    communicators must determine the fundamental paradigms for
    composing imagery for understanding

    Therefore the purpose of this conference is to bring together a
    breadth of disciplines including but not limited to the
    physical biological and computational sciences technology art
    psychology philosophy and education in order to define and
    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the
    computer graphics context
