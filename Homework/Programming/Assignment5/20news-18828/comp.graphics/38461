The most ridiculous example of VRexploitation Ive seen so far is the
Virtual Reality Clothing Company which recently opened up in Vancouver As
far as I can tell its just another chic clothes spot Although it would be
interesting if they were selling virtual clothing

Email me if you want me to dig up their phone  and you can probably get
some promotional lit

I understand there have been a couple of raves in LA billing themselves as
Virtual Reality parties What I hear they do is project GIF images around
on the walls as well as run animations through a Newtek Toaster

Seems like we need to adopt the term Really Virtual Reality or something except
for the nonimmersive stuff which is Virtually Really Virtual Reality


etc
