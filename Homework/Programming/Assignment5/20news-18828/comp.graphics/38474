Subject Re Newsgroup Split

 Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in favor of
 doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
 this group from code to hardware to algorithms  I just think making 5
 different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts
 a week per group  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
 for discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
 Just curious
