Subject Re detecting double points in bezier curves

In article ia522B1w165woeinckwaterlandwlinknl ferdinanoeinckwaterlandwlinknl Ferdinand Oeinck writes
 Im looking for any information on detecting andor calculating a double
 point andor cusp in a bezier curve
 
 An algorithm literature reference or mail about this is very appreciated

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors Sorry not to be more specific I dont have the
reference here with me

The article actually was more general than this giving a way to decide
whether a given cubic Bezier curve contains cusps intersection points
or whatever wierdness The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH 89
course notes for the course called Math for Siggraph or something like
that
