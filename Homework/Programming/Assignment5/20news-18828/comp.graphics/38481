Im getting ready to buy a multimedia workstation and would like a little
advice  I need a graphics card that will do video in and out under windows
I was originally thinking of a Targa but that doesnt work under Windows
What cards should I be looking into

Thanks

 You should still consider the Targa I run windows 31 on it all the
 time at work and it works fine I think all you need is the right
 driver
