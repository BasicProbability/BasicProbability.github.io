Could anyone tell me if its possible to save each frame
of a gl grasp animation to gif jpg iff or any other
picture formats

 
     If you have the GRASP animation system then yes its quite easy
You simply use GLIB to extract the image each frame in a GL is
actually a complete PCX or CLP file then use one of MANY available
utilities to convert it  If you dont have the GRASP package Im afraid
I cant help you  Sorry
     By the way before you ask GRASP GRaphics Animation System for
Professionals is a commercial product that sells for just over US300
from most mailorder companies Ive seen  And no I dont have it
