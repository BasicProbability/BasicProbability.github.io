 Im building a CAD package and need a 3D graphics library that can handle
 some rudimentry tasks such as hidden line removal shading animation etc
 
 Can you please offer some recommendations

I think APDA has something called MacWireFrame which is a full
wireframe and supposedly hiddenline removal library
I think it weighs in at 99 but Ive been wrong on an order
of magnitude before


 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today The cost is 299 but there
 are no license royalties His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento CA phone
 9167371550 He doesnt have email Very nice guy very knowledgeable about
 graphics Seems like he may have a decent package Its an Object Pascal Framework
 that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes 
 Im going to check it out and see if its got what I need for my CAD package

 I also found another package 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle
 The number is 2068685418 also no email The package is strong at ray tracing
 Im not too sure about its geometry creation tools I also need to look into this
 package some more I also spoke with the author Mark Owens another nice
 guy that seems to know his business The price is 249 no royalties
