 Can you please offer some recommendations

Its really not that hard to do  There are books out there which explain
everything and the basic 3D functions translation rotation shading and
hidden line removal are pretty easy  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht
he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel

 Yes I want to concentrate on other development issues  Ive created graphics
 libraries before its too time consuming lifes too short

	Also Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in and Think pascal
can access them and I would expect that THINK C could as well  If you can
find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent
choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the Mac so should be
fast

Just to clarify the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray not the ROM of the mac  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot  However it is quite
limited in the sense that its a lowlevel 3D library your code still has
to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum  It has nothing
on GL for example where you can handle objects

 Thanks for the clarification Before posting my original request I had looked
 into the Macs 3D capabilities and dismissed them as low grade
