   And CDIs CPU doesnt help much either  I understand it is
a 68070 supposedly a variation of a 6800068010 running at something
like 7Mhz  With this speed you truly need sprites

Wow A 68070 Id be very interested to get my hands on one of these
especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
68060 which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup 8D

Dont get too excited Signetics not Motorola gave the 68070 its number
The 68070 if I understand rightly uses the 68000 instruction set and has
an onchip serial port and DMA  It will run at up to 15 MHzIm typing
at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate so I know that it can
do soso I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardorchlandvnetibmcom
claims
