Hello netters
 
I have a fairly weak question to ask everybody in netland  Ive looked though
the last FAQ for compgraphics but I didnt find my answer  Thus the post
 
Ill keep it short
 
QUESTION  How do I display any raster files gif files iff or tiff images
that I have on my root window or background  I have a sun ipc openwindows
30 Sun OS 413 if that helps any
 
Ive compiled POV for the sun and would like to display some of the work I have
done as a backgroundtile  Thanks for any help or information that you
provide  Have a good day
