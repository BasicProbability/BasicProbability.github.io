Gday all

Can anybody point me at a utility which will readconvertcropwhatnot
display HDF image files  Ive had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA 
and it must take an award for odd directory structure strange storage
approaches and minimalist documentation 

Part of the problem is that I want to look at large 5MB HDF files and
crop out a section Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility from
which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily I can convert the cropped
part into another format for viewinganimation

Otherwise can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation SW
for HDF 32r5 or 33beta and do the above croppingetc This is for
Suns with SunOS 412

Any help GREATLY appreciated Ta muchly 

Cheers
	Markus
