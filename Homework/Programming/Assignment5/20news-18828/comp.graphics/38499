Subject Re TIFF philosophical significance of 42

ulrichgalkitoppointde wrote

 According to the TIFF 50 Specification the TIFF version number
 bytes 23 42 has been chosen for its deep philosophical 
 significance

 When I first read this I rotfl Finally some philosphy in a technical
 spec But still I wondered what makes 42 so significant

 Last week I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy and rotfl the
 second time After millions of years of calculation the secondbest
 computer of all time reveals that 42 is the answer to the question
 about life the universe and everything

 Is this actually how they picked the number 42

Yes

 Does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from

I dont know where Douglas Adams took it from but Im pretty sure hes
the one who launched it in the Guide Since then its been showing up 
all over the place
