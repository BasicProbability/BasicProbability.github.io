    And CDIs CPU doesnt help much either  I understand it is
 a 68070 supposedly a variation of a 6800068010 running at something
 like 7Mhz  With this speed you truly need sprites
 
 Wow A 68070 Id be very interested to get my hands on one of these
 especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
 68060 which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup 8D
 
 Dont get too excited Signetics not Motorola gave the 68070 its number
 The 68070 if I understand rightly uses the 68000 instruction set and has
 an onchip serial port and DMA  It will run at up to 15 MHzIm typing
 at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate so I know that it can
 do soso I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardorchlandvnetibmcom
 claims

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesnt mean the CDI
is running at that speed  I said  I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz  I am not sure but I think I read this a long
time ago

   Anyway still with 15Mhz you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
making cool awesome games read psygnosis
