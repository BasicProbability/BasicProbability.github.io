 Why so up tight  FOr that matter TIFF6 is out now so why not gripe
 about its problems  Also if its so important to you volunteer to
 help define or critique the spec

Ive got the 60 spec obviously since I quoted it in my last posting 
My gripe about TIFF is that its far too complicated and nearly
infinitely easier to write than to read which I think hurts your
acceptance by anything that will need to read those images eg
paint programs

In a nutshell I dont think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is
trimmed significantly and then it wouldnt be TIFF anymore  They
keep trying to cut it back but its late now  Maybe they will fix it
and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility 
That would probably make me happy
