Hi

The RTrace ray tracer supports 3D text as a primitive not collections of
spheres cylinders and so on
The 3D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded

Please have a look at asterixinescnpt 1923524617 in directory
pubRTrace
In pubRTracetmp there are some demo images with high quality text
All of them are called Textjpg JPEG encoded See them first and then
tell me what you think

Regards
Antonio
