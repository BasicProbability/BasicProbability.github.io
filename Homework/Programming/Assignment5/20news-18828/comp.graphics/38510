Subject RTrace 820

There is a new version of the RTrace raytracing package 820 at
asterixinescnpt 1923524617 in directory pubRTrace
Check the README file

RTrace now can use the SUIT toolkit to have a nice user interface
Compile it with DSUIT or modify the Makefile
SUIT is available at suituvacscsvirginiaedu
I have binaries of RTrace with SUIT for SUN Sparc SGI Indigo
and DOSGO32
Please contact me if interested



The MAC RTrace 10 port is in directory pubRTraceMacintosh
Thanks to Reid Judd reidjuddeastsuncom and

Small changes were done since version 810 mainly

1 Now it is possible to discard backface polygons and triangles
   for fast preview

2 The support program scn2sff has been reworked to use temp files
