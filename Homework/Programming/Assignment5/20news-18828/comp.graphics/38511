Beware  There is only one such copyrighted image and the company
that generated is known to protect that copyright  That image took
hundreds of manhours to build from the source satellite images
so it is unlikely that competing images will appear soon

So they should sue the newspaper I got it from for printing it
The article didnt say anything about copyrights
