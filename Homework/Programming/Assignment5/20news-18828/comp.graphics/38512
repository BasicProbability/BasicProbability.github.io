   CH Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in
   CH favor of doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of
   CH graphics by reading this group from code to hardware to
   CH algorithms  I just think making 5 different groups out of this
   CH is a wate and will only result in a few posts a week per group
   CH I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for
   CH discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
   CH Just curious
 
 I must agree  There is a dizzying number of csamiga newsgroups
 already  In addition there are very few issues which fall cleanly
 into one of these categories
 
 Also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
 groups is already plagued with megacrossposting thus the groupsplit
 would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured
 environment

Hi
It might be nice to know whats possible on different hard ware platforms
But usually the hard ware is fixed  in my case either Unix or DOS PC 
So Im not much interested in Amiga news 

In the case of Software I wont get any comercial software mentioned in this
newgroup to run on a Unix platform so Im not interested in this information

I would suggest to split the group I dont see the problem of crossposting
Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size 

BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
TRAFFIC A LOT
