 Does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from
I dont know where Douglas Adams took it from but Im pretty sure hes
the one who launched it in the Guide Since then its been showing up 
all over the place

Douglas Adams once said paraphrased from memory I just picked it  It
seemed like the sort of number you wouldnt be afraid to take home to meet
your parents  Nice and even perfectly normal
