Subject Antialiasing utility wanted

I am currently using POVRay on Mac and was wondering if anyone in netland
knows of public domain antialiasing utilities so that I can skip this step
in POV very slow on this machine  Any suggestions opinions about
posttrace antialiasing would be greatly appreciated
