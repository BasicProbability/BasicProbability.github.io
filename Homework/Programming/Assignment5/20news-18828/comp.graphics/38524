Subject Another CVIEW question was CView answers


	Has anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident
8900c hicolor card At best the colors come out screwed up and at worst the 
program hangs I loaded the VESA driver and the same thing happens on 2 
different machines

	If it doesnt work on the Trident does anybody know of a viewer that 
does

Thanx
