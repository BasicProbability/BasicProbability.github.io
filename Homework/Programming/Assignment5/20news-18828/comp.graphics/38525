Subject Re Sun IPX root window display  background picture


Im not sure if you got the information you were looking for so Ill
post it anyway for the general public  To load an image on your root
window add this line to the end of your xsession file

 xloadimage onroot fullscreen giffilename 

This is assuming of course you have the xloadimage client and as
for the switches I think they pretty much explain what is going on
If you leave out the  the terminal locks till you kill it
You already knew that though

Hope this helps
