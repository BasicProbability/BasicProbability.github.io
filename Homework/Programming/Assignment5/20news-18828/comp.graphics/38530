Subject Re images of earth

I downloaded an image of the earth reconstructed from elevation data taken
at 12 degree increments The author not me wrote some ccode included
that read in the data file and generated bw and pseudo color images They
work very well and are not incumbered by copyright They are at an aminet
site near you called earthlha in the amigapixmisc area

I refer you to the included docs for the details on how the author sorry I
forget his name created these images The raw data is not included
