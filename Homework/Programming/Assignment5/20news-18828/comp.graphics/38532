So they should sue the newspaper I got it from for printing it
The article didnt say anything about copyrights

	The newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its
entirety  Newspapers generally employ legal staffs which make sure
they get permission to use a copyrighted image or text  Did you
do the same
