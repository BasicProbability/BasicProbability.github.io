 However that is almost overkill  Something more like this would probably
 make EVERYONE a lot happier
 
 compgraphicsprogrammer
 compgraphicshardware
 compgraphicsapps
 compgraphicsmisc

Thats closer but I dislike apps  software vs hardware
would be better  Would that engulf altgraphicspixutils  Or would
that be programmer

I dont know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup
split  Look how busy compgraphicsresearch is not

Its true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing FAQs and
discussing things that would probably be better diverted to
systemspecific groups but I dont know whether a split would help
or hurt that cause

Maybe we need a compgraphicsRTFB for all those people who cant be
bothered to read the fine books out there  Right Dr Rogers
