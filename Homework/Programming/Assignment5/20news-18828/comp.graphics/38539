  CH Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in
  CH favor of doing this  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of
  CH graphics by reading this group from code to hardware to
  CH algorithms  I just think making 5 different groups out of this
  CH is a wate and will only result in a few posts a week per group
  CH I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for
  CH discussing all aspects of graphics  Anyone else feel this way
  CH Just curious

I must agree  There is a dizzying number of csamiga newsgroups
already  In addition there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories

Also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with megacrossposting thus the groupsplit
would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured
environment


   
      Michael Nerone   I shall do so with my customary lack of tact and

Maybe I should point out that we are not talking about csamiga
Only compgraphics
