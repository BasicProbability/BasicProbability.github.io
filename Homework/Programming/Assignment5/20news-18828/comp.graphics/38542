 Lets be serious Im working on a radiosity package written in C
 I would like to make it public domain  Ill announce it in cg the minute

 That were the good news The bad news Itll take another 2 months at least
 to finish it


 Are you using the traditional radiosity method progressive refinement or
  something else in your package

 If you need to project patches on the hemicube surfaces what technique are
  you using  Do you have hardware to facilitate the projection



 In the meantime you may have a look at the file
