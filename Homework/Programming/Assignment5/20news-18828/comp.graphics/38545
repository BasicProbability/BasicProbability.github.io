 According to the TIFF 50 Specification the TIFF version number
 bytes 23 42 has been chosen for its deep philosophical 
 significance

 Last week I read the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy and rotfl the
 second time After millions of years of calculation the secondbest
 computer of all time reveals that 42 is the answer to the question
 about life the universe and everything

 Is this actually how they picked the number 42

Yes

 Does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from

   At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in
his notebook called out Silence and read out from his book
Rule Fortytwo All persons more than a mile high to leave the court
   Everybody looked at Alice
   Im not a mile high said Alice
   You are said the King
   Nearly two miles high added the queen
   Well I shant go at any rate said Alice besides thats not
a regular rule you invented it just now
   Its the oldest rule in the book said the King
   Then it ought to be Number One said Alice
