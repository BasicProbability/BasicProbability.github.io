Subject Re Fast polygon routine needed

What kind of polygons  Shaded  Texturemapped  Hm  More comes into play with
fast routines than just polygons  It would be nice to know exaclty what
system VGA is a start but what processor and a few of the specifics of the
implementation  You need to give  more info if you want to get any answers P

I dont want texture mapped cause if I did Id asked for them   Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons  As for the processor itd
be for a minimum of a 286 maybe 386 if I cant find a good one for 286s
Ideally I want a polyn function that can clip to a userdefined viewport
and write to an arbitrary location in memory  Of course the chances of
finding something like that are pretty remote so I guess Id need the source
with it  Oh and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise itd be too
slow  Ive seen some polygon routines in C and theyve all been waaay too
slow  Its for a 3D vector graphics program  Ive been hunting high and low
for a polyn function in ASM and I cant find one anywhere that I can use
Ive found one or two polyn functions but my ASM is pretty bad so I wont
even try to rewrite them
