Subject Re SGI sales practices Was Crimson Was Kubota Announcement

 What I am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
 we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
 Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck

It should have been made fairly clear that the most Crimson would
ever get was a 150 75 old style MHz CPU upgrade  Certainly this
was mentioned on compsyssgi on more than one occasion as being
likely  If our sales folks were saying otherwise they were either
confused or less than honestethical or somebody further up the
chain inside SGI was misleading them

 Im also annoyed about being sold several Personal IRISes at a
 previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around
 for a while rather than being flushed

There were 4 versions 20 25 30 35 although admittedly the 30 came
out at the same time as the 35 over a period of 2 12 years  The
chassis simply couldnt be pushed any further  Id say 4 years was
a pretty good lifespan myself for a system design in this day and
age  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our
minds to push it further and I know that was made clear almost
from the day the 35 started shipping  We had one last kicker in
the form of the Elan graphics which made 3 graphics versions over
its lifespan which I also think is pretty good

 Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
 keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that I found myself
 pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
 just before the end of the quarter but Im just a little tired of
 getting boned in the process

Please by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support
or sales on your concerns  There should be no reason for sales folks
to misrepresent future upgrades to customers sure sometimes there
will be confusion for a while over whether an upgrade will be available
but that shouldnt last too long and doesnt seem to be what you
are referring to

Yes the sales folks do get bonuss at the end of some all quarters
but that is pretty common industry wide and sometimes that can result
in good deals for customers sometimes it probably pushes folks into
systems that arent what they need Im sure but nobody is forcing
you to buy at end of quarter after all

 Maybe its because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies so we
 arent entitled to a peek under the covers as the Big Kids NASA
 for instance are  This lab and I suspect that a lot of other labs

They dont get all that long a lead time either although certainly
they get presentations on possible new products and their opinions
may well influence the end product but that also is life in the
industry  We cant design systems that meet just their needs or we
wont sell too many systems after all which is not to say that we
dont have some niche products like Reality Engine

 and organizations doesnt have a load of money to spend on computers
 every year so we cant be out buying new systems on a regular basis
 The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
 entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond  That
 means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
 have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one
 previous posters words to fill a niche to compete with some other
 vendor  Im going to be looking at this box for the next five years
 And every time I look at it Im going to think about SGI and how I
 could have better spent my money actually your money since were
 supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars

But surely you dont expect a system you buy now for a five year
period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year
period  Thats a rather unreasonable expectation in my experience
with workstationsmicrocomputers  Supported and parts available
yes but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest

 Now youll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a
 corner somewhere and think dark libelous thoughts

I missed your first posting but as I say by all means share your
frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might
have an effect not immediate Im sure but complaints arent
going to be ignored and may affect future plans if we 
hear similar things from more than one personsite

All of the above is as usual my personal opinion not SGIs
