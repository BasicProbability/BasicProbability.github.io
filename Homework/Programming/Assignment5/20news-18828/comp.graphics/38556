 Im looking for any information on detecting andor calculating a double
 point andor cusp in a bezier curve
 
 An algorithm literature reference or mail about this is very appreciated

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors Sorry not to be more specific I dont have the
reference here with me


Stone DeRose Geometric characterization of parametric cubic curves
ACM Trans Graphics 8 3 1989 147  163


Manocha Canny Detecting cusps and inflection points in curves
Computer aided geometric design 9 1992 124
