  Does anyone have any  other suggestions where the 42 came from

    At this moment the King who had been for some time busily writing in
 his notebook called out Silence and read out from his book
 Rule Fortytwo All persons more than a mile high to leave the court
    Everybody looked at Alice
    Im not a mile high said Alice
    You are said the King
    Nearly two miles high added the queen
    Well I shant go at any rate said Alice besides thats not
 a regular rule you invented it just now
    Its the oldest rule in the book said the King
    Then it ought to be Number One said Alice

Does anybody have a collection of occurances of 42 before and after
The Guide If not I would like to receive any odd bits you might know
