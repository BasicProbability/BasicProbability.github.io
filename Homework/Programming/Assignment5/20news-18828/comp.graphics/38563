 file check in the graphics directories under grasp  The problem 
 is that the clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
 the many pd format converters I have used Any hint welcome

    The gl2p1lzh stuff under gfxshow on the Aminet sites includes a
    utility called pic2hl that is a filter for HamLab that can handle
    the most commonly used kinds of PIC and CLP files

    The biggest problem is that the CLP files dont usually contain a
    palette so you need to convert a PIC with the right palette
    first which creates a rampicpal file and then convert the
    CLP files
