 We have been using Iterated Systems compression board to compress 
 pathology images and are getting ratios of 401 to 701 without too
 much loss in quality It is taking about 4 mins per image to compress
 on a 25Mhz 486 but decompression is almost real time on a 386 in software 
 alone

How does that compare with JPEG on the same images and hardware as far
as size speed and image quality are concerned

Despite my skeptical and sometimes nearly rabid postings
criticizing Barnsley and company I am very interested in the
technique  If I werent I probably wouldnt be so critical
