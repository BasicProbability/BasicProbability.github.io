 Lets be serious Im working on a radiosity package written in C
 I would like to make it public domain  Ill announce it in cg the minute
 I finished it

 That were the good news The bad news Itll take another 2 months at least
 to finish it


 Are you using the traditional radiosity method progressive refinement or
  something else in your package


My package is based on several articles about nonstandard radiosity and
some unpublished methods

The main articles are

  Cohen Chen Wallace Greenberg  
    A Progressive Refinement Approach to fast Radiosity Image Generation
     Computer Graphics SIGGRAPH V 22No 4 pp 7584 August 1988

  Silion Puech
    A General TwoPass Method Integrating Specular and Diffuse Reflection
    Computer Graphics SIGGRAPH V23No 3 pp335344 July 1989 

 If you need to project patches on the hemicube surfaces what technique are
  you using  Do you have hardware to facilitate the projection


I do not use hemicubes I have no special hardware SUN SPARCstation



 In the meantime you may have a look at the file
   RadiositycodetarZ
 located at
   compute1ccncsuedu


  What are the guest username and password for this ftp site


Use anonymous as username and your email address as password



 there are some other locations have a look at archie to get the nearest

 Hope thatll help

 Yours
