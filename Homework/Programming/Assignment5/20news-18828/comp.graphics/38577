WHAT IS OTIS

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny    
and distribution  Digital immortality

The basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around nearforever  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future  Perhaps theyll be put in different
formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapesbut theyll be
thereand someone will dig them up  
 
If that doesnt interest you OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your worksa virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors  Suddenly life is 
breathed into your workand by merit of its stimulus it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons
 
Spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when youve got the gumption
thats what theyre here for

HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE
              
What happens isyou draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo get it scanned into an image file then either FTPput
it in the CONTRIBIncoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
email addresses at eof in email  After the image is received
it will be put into the correct directory  Computer originated works
are also welcome

OTIS directories house two types of image files GIF and JPG  
GIF and JPG files require oddly enough a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find  If you cant find one but do have a GIF viewer  
you can obtain a JPGtoGIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format 

OTIS also accepts animation files      

When you submit image files please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people
to view  Also include some biographical information on yourself well
be having infofiles on each contributing artist and their works  You 
can also just upload a textfile of info about yourself instead of 
emailing

If you have pictures but no scanner there is hope  Merely send
copies to

The OTIS Project
co Ed Stastny
PO BX 241113
Omaha NE 681241113

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back  
Also include information on each image preferably a 13 line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where its finally put  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named include those as well  
 
Conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please
contact me and well arrange things

If you want to submit your works by disk peachy  Merely send a 35
disk to the above address Omaha and a SASE if you want your disk back
This is good for people who dont have direct access to encoders or FTP
but do have access to a scanner  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format  If possible please submit image files as GIF or
JPG  If you cantwe can convert from most formatswed just rather
not have to

At senders request we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand  Even if you dont have stuff to contribute you can send
a blank disk and an SASE or 250 for disk postage and packing to 
get a slaboOTIS

As of 042193 were at about 18 megabytes of files and growing  
Email me for current archive size and directory



DISTRIBUTION

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to
another  In fact we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such  If you could please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images  
 
It would also be nice if youd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is

Its the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible  If you have the time please upload a few to your favorite
BBS systemor even just post this infofile there  It would be
keen of you



USE

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory
youll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or
full address credit  You will either find this in the rm file for    
the image or series of imagesor in the Artists directory under the 
Artists name  If permission isnt explicitly given then youll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it  If no info is available email
me edcwisunomahaedu and Ill get in contact with the artist for 
you or give you their contact information
 
When you DO use permitted work its always courteous to let the artist
know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files



NAMING IMAGES

Please keep the names of your files in dos format  That means keep
the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or
four digit code for the series of images plus the series number
Thus Leonardo DeVincis fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like
 
	ldmek5gif     OR    ldmek5jpg    OR    ldmech5gif   ETC

Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems  


 

CREATING IMAGE FILES

When creating image files be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture  This gives people a reference in
case theyd like to contact you  You may also want to include a title
address or other information youd like people to know



HMMM

Thats about it for now  More guidelines will be added as needed
Your input is expected
