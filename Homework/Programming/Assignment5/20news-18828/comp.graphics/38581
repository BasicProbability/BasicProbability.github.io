A fast polygon routine to do WHAT
To draw polygons of course  Its a VGA mode 13h 320x200 game 

Hi Ive come across a fast triangle filldraw routine for mode 13h  By
calling this routine enough times you have a fast polygon drawing routine

I think I ftped from wuarchivewustledupubMSDOSUPLOADSprogramming
I have a copy of it so I reupload it there  The triangletxt file has this
to say 

  C and inline assembly source for a VGA mode 13h triangle drawer

Another source  Theres a poly blitter for mode y mode x in 320x200
at suneeuwaterlooca  Also there is REND386 an even faster 3D
renderer with VR extensions
