Subject ray tracing spline surfaces


Hi net
Due to further investigation I would like to study the following article
	Peterson Ray tracing general BSplines
	Proc ACM Mountain Regional Conference April 1986
Unfortunately I didnt find it in any librarys register
If there is anyone having access to this paper or knowing about a
library containing those proceedings preferrably in Germany please 
let me know Any help would be appreciated 

Thanks a lot 
Joerg Haber
