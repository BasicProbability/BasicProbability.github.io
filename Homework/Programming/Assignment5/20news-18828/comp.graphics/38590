Subject SCF files help needed



Ive got an old demo disk that I need to view It was made using RIX Softworks  
The files on the two diskette set end with scf

The demo was VGA resolution 256 colors but I dont know the spatial  
resolution

First problem When I try to run the demo the screen has two black bars that  
cut across horizontally the screen in the top third and bottom third of the  
screen The bars are about 1inch wide Other than this the demo the  
animation part seems to be running fine

Second problem I cant find any graphics program that will open and display  
these files I have a couple of image conversion programs none mention scf  
files

The system I am using 486clone Diamond Speedstar 24 Sony monitor

Any suggestions

Thank You
