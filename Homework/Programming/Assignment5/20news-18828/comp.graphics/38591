Subject QUESTION Video Projector

I am setting up a videoaid for a computer room for the teacher to share his
display with the class

I have seen people using video projector TV sets and large monitor to do
presentations before I am told that there are three ways to connect video
projector composite YC  RGB

Can anyone explain to me the difference and their likely costs

Please reply to my INETNET Email account as well as posting in bulletin

I also like to know if there are TELNET or KERMIT for windows
