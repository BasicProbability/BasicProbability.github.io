Subject Re Need specsinfo on Apple QuickTime

I need to get the specs or at least a very verbose interpretation of the
specs for QuickTime  Technical articles from magazines and references to
books would be nice too

I also need the specs in a format usable on a Unix or MSDOS system  I cant
do much with the QuickTime stuff they have on ftpapplecom in its present
format

Apple just released the Quicktime volume of the new Inside Macintosh series
Any bookstore with reasonable technical stock should have it
