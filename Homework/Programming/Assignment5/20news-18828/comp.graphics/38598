 Im looking for shading methods and algorithms
 Please let me know if you know where to get source codes for that

Illumination and Color in Computer Generated Imagery by Roy Hall contains c
source for several famous illumination models including Bouknight Phong
Blinn Whitted and Hall illumination models If you want an introduction to
shading you might look through the book Writing a Raytracer edited by
Glassner Also the book Procedural elements for Computer Graphics by Rogers
is a good reference Source for code in these book are available on the net i 
believe you might check out nicfunetfi or some site closer to you carrying 
graphics related stuff 

Hope this is what you were asking for
