I have an ATI Graph Ultra Pro VLB w2 megs and have a small question
about Graphics Workshop for Windows  When I exit from it it says my
current driver can handle on 32768 colors when I am actually in 
1024x768x65000 color mode  Is this a driver problem a GWS error or
what  I am using the 1559 driver under Win 31  It correctly
states that I can display 16M colors when I switch to 800x600x24bit
though
Another question Anybody know of any Viewers that support this card
other than Windows viewers
Any help would be appreciated
