Sorry for the repeat of this request but does anyone know of a good
freeshareware program with which I can create raytraces and save
them as bitmapped files  Of course if there is such a thing 

Thanks in advance

There are 2 books published by MT BOOKS that come with C source code on
floppies  They are

Programming In 3 Dimensions 3D Graphics Ray Traycing and Animation
by Christopher D Watkins and Larry Sharp

Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C
by Christopher D Watkins Stephen B Coy and Mark Finlay

I have the first book and it is a great intro to 3D Ray Tracing and
Animation  Most of the programs are on the disk compiled and ready to run

I have only glanced at the second book but it also appears to be good

Hope this helps
