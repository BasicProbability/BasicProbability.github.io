Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this

	I was crusing the net earlier this year and came upon something called 
Color pict of spinning earth  I am assuming it is a animation sequence of the 
earths rotation or revolution I always get those mixed up  At the time I 
found it my sysem would not even support color graphics so I didnt bother to 
get the pict  Now I have a fairly nice system and cant find the pict again
If anyone can help please post here or Email me 
Thanks in advance
