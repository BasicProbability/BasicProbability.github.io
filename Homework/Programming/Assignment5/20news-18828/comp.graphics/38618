Subject Re SCF files help needed

Second problem I cant find any graphics program that will open and display  
these files I have a couple of image conversion programs none mention scf  
files

RIXs files with the extension  sci and scf are just a RAW file with
a 256 color palette
The first 10 bytes is a kind of header with the name RIX among 7bytes unknown stuff The you have 768 bytes of palette info 3256 for the colors RGB
and then you have the picture in raw format
If you dont know how to make a viewer of of this description you can get VPIC
it is able to read the files

regards
Thomas
