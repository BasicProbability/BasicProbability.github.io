Subject 3D display software



   I have the need for displaying 2 12 D surfaces under X using only
Xlib Xt and Xm  Does anyone know of a package available on internet
which will be able to do the work

   I am looking for a STANDALONE package providing similar functions
to xprism3 available with Khoros but without the numerous libraries
required for it  I want to be able to recompile it and run it on
various platforms from SGIs to i486s UNIX

   Any help will be appreciated
