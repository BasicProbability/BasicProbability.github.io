 Why not use the PD C library for readingwriting TIFF files It took me a
 good 20 minutes to start using them in your own app

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF and it usually works
very well  Thats not my point  Im philosophically opposed to it
because of its complexity

This complexity has led to some programs poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files other programs inability to load TIFF
images though theyll save them of course and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF

As the saying goes Its not me Im worried about its all the
other  assholes out there  Ive had big trouble with misuse and
abuse of TIFF over the years and I chalk it all up to the immense and
unnecessary complexity of the format

In the words of the TIFF 50 spec Appendix G page G1 capitalized
emphasis mine

The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible at the expense of simplicity  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB
and that is currently the only way you can be sure that you will be
able to import any TIFF image since there are so many
imagegenerating applications out there now


If a program or worse all applications cant read every TIFF
image that means there are some it wont some that I might have to
deal with  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format  I
dont and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning not
that anyone does of course
