Subject Marching Cubs
From abildbertcsbyuedu

 Hello

Hello

     I was wondering if anyone knew of a PC or MAC
implementation of the marching cubes algorithm that will output
the individual faces  If there is no such application might there
be some C source code that I could modify to implement the
algorithm and get to the individual faces

Thanks in advance
Sincerly
