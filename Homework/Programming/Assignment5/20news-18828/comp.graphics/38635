Subject Epson HPGL 4 pen plotter W340 Pens 500  BO

Greetings
    I have an Epson HI80 4 pen plotter forsale  It emulates an HP 7570
or 7574  Im not sure which  It has an option board on it that does
the emulation  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake I
also have 340 Pens for it as follows  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based 16
packs of 4 RedGreen Blue and Black pens 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black
7 packs of 4 Aqueous RGBlueBlack  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color
pens  and 114 assorted nonpackaged pens mostly colored

    The plotter is used  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for
HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine  It accepts either A or B
sized paper 85 x 11 or 11x17

    I figure that the plotter is worth about 300 and the pens are worth at
least another 200 more  One thing is certain you wont need to
purchase any pens for quite a while  All of the packaged pens were
sealed so they are all still fresh  The rest were capped and seem to
function as well

    Id be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
just them

    Im selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I dont need color

    Id like 350 or best offer
