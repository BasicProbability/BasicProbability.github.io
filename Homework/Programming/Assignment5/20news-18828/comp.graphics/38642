re majority of users not readding from floppy
Well how about those of us who have 1400picture CDROMS and would like to use
CVIEW because it is fast and it works well but cant because the moron lacked
the foresight to create the temp file in the programs path not the current
didrectory


  Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or
 TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable  This is pretty much a standard for DOS Windows and OS2
 applications

Unfortunately cview does not pay attention to the temp environment variable
