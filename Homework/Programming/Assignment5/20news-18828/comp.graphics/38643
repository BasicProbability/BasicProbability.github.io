 Ive got the 60 spec obviously since I quoted it in my last posting 
 My gripe about TIFF is that its far too complicated and nearly
 infinitely easier to write than to read
 
 Why not use the PD C library for readingwriting TIFF files It took me a
 good 20 minutes to start using them in your own app
