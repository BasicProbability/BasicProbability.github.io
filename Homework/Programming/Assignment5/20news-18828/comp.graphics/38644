Subject Need info on ccMail file format

I need the file format for ccMail file formats  it seems to be PCXbased
but with a twist only the first page of a multipage fax will come out
readable The other pages disappear The format seems to be proprietary

Anybody got any clues I have to give my email FAXes to my secretary in
order to get em unscrambled I want a filter from ccMail to pnbm

Come to think of it pnbm to ccMail would be nice too
