 Im looking for any information on detecting andor calculating a double
 point andor cusp in a bezier curve
 
 See

 Ive used that reference and found that I needed to go to their
 original tech report

First thanks to all who replied to my original question

Ive implemented the ideas from the article above and Im very satisfied
with the results I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine
In some cases generating offset curves loops can occur I now have a
fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop Although
I did not follow the article above strictly The check if the fourth control
point lies in the the loop area which is bounded by two parabolas and
one ellips is too complicated Instead I enlarged the looparea and
surrounded it by for straight lines The check is now simple and fast and
my approximation routine never ever outputs selfintersecting bezier curves
again
