 Certainly you read the other answer from Kevin Martin He write about DVX 
  
 
     What is it  Could Someone answer 

Funny thing the InterNet I have no idea what xv221 might be  except that it
might be something to do with Xwindows on PCs  If you know and have used
it and think that it is good email me ryanphmrldstogovau

DVX is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporations DesqviewX
software

I have not used DVX yet but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me it
sounds pretty great
	 allows multiple DOS machines  the way that OS2 does but without
requiring 10 MB of RAM to get OS2 going
	 preemptive multitasking
	 network computing  a proper Xwindows clientserver application 
this means that DOS program can be used on other Xwindows computers on your
network and that Xwindows programs can be used on your DVX computer
	 although it is NOT a version of Unix it effectively has many of
Unixs features and mostly you will be able to compile unixtype programs
using the djgpp or gnu c compilers

They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
magazines They also have InterNet support online supportqdeckcom
