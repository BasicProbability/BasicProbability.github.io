  Are there significant differences between V201 and V200 
  Thank you for helping
 
 
 No  As I recall the only differences are in the 3dsset parameters  some
 of the defaults have changed slightly  Ill look when I get home and let
 you know but there isnt enough to actually warrant upgrading

Wrongthe major improvements for 201 and 201a are in the use of IPAS routines
for 3d studio  They have increased in speed anywhere from 30200 depending
on which ones you use

All the Yost group IPAS routines that you can buy separate from the 3d studio
package require the use of 201 or 201a  They are too slow with 200
