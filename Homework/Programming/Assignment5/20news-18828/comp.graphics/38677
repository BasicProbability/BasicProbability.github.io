  Has anyone got multiverse to work 
  
  I have built it on 486 svr4 mips svr4s and Sun SparcStation
  
  There seems to be many bugs in it  The dogfight and dactyl simply do nothing
  After fixing a bug where a variable is defined twice in two different modules  One needed
  setting to static  else the client coredumped

 I built it on a rs6000 my only Motif machine works fine  I added some objects
 into dogfight so I could get used to flying  This was very easy 
 All in all Cool

The RS6000 compiler is so forgiving I think that if you mixed COBOL  pascal
the C compiler still wouldnt complain
