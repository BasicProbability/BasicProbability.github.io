 	Could somebody let me know of a drawing utility that can be
 used to manipulate postscript filesI am specifically interested in
 drawing lines boxes and the sort on Postscript contour plots
 	I have tried xfig and I am impressed by its features However
 it is of no use since I cannot use postscript files as input for the
 programmeIs there a utility that converts postscript to xfig format
 	Any help would be greatly appreciated

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator There are a few Unix versions
for it available depending on your platform I know of two Unix versions
One for Mach NeXT and for Irix SGI There may be others such
as for Sun SparcStation but I dont know for sure
