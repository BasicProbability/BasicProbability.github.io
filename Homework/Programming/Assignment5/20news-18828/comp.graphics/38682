1 Introduction
  This program can let you READ WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats It also let you do some special effectsROTATION DITHERING 
  on image Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts
  Include simple file management system
  Support slide show
  There is NO LIMIT on image size
  Currently this program supports 8 15 16 24 bits display
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor you must have VESA driver
  If you want to modify video driver please read section 8


2 Hardware Requirement
  PC 386 or better MSDOS 33 or higher
  min amount of ram is 4M bytesMaybe less memory will also work
  I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance
  Hard disk for swappingvirtual memory

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP

  Supported Wares

   Up to 128M of extended memory expanded under VCPI
   Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
   SuperVGA 256color mode up to 1024x768
   80387
   XMS  VDISK memory allocation strategies
   VCPI programs such as QEMM DESQview and 386MAX

  Unsupported

   DPMI
   Microsoft Windows

  Features 80387 emulator 32bit unixish environment flat memory
  model SVGA graphics


3 Installation
  Video drivers emu387 and go32exe are borrowed from DJGPP
  If you use Western Digital VGA chips read readmewd
  This GO32EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version
   But some people report that this go32exe is not compatible with
      other DJGPP programs in their system If you encounter this problem
      DONT put go32exe within search path

   Please read runmebat for how to run this program

  If you choose xxxxxgrn as video driver add nc 256 to environment
    GO32

  For example go32driver xxxxxxxxxxxgrn nc 256

  If you dont have 80x87 add emu xxxxxxemu387 to environment GO32

  For example go32driver xxxxxxxxxxxgrd emu xxxxxxemu387

   Notes 1 I only test tr8900grn et4000grn and vesagrn
                 Other drivers are not tested
              2 I have modified et4000grn to support 8 15 16 24 bits
                 display You dont need to use vesa driver
                 If et4000grn doesnt work please try vesagrn
              3 For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display
                 please use vesagrnexcept et4000 users
                 You can find vesa BIOS driver from 
                   wuarchivewustledu mirrorsmsdosgraphics

7 Detail

   Initialization
      Set default display type to highest display type
      Find allowable screen resolutionfor grn video driver only

   1 When you run this program you will enter read menu Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key except F5 If you move or copy
      files you will enter write menu the write menu is much like
      read menu but only allow you to change directory
       The header line in read menu includes dxxfxxtxx
         d  display type f number of files t number of tagged files
      pressing SPACE in read menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file
      pressing RETURN in read menu will let you reading current file This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is
        The procedure is First check magic number If fail check
        standard extension Still fail report error
      pressing s or S in read menu will do Slide Show
        If delay time is 0 program will wait until you hit a key
          except ESCAPE
        If any error occurs program will make a beep
        ESCAPE to terminate
      pressing Ins in read menu will change display type
      pressing ALTX in read menu will quit program without prompting

   2 Once image file is successfully read you will enter screen menu
      Within this menu F5 is turn on You can do special effect on image
      pressing RETURN show image
        in graphic mode press RETURN SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode
      pressing TAB change processing target This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8bit or 24bit image
      pressing LeftRight arrow change display type 8 15 16 24 bits
      pressing SPACE save current image to file
        BW Dither save as blackwhite image1 bit
        Grey Scale save as grey image8 bits
        Full Color save as color image8 bits
        True Color save as 24bit image

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file Some questions are formatdependent Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory please press SPACE after
        pressing SPACE you will enter write2 menu You can change
        directory to what you want Then

        pressing SPACE this program will prompt you original filename
        pressing RETURN this program will prompt you selected filename
                      filename under bar


  3 This program supports 8 15 16 24 bits display

  4 This Program is MEMORY GREEDY If you dont have enough memory
     the performance is poor

  5 If you want to save 8 bits image 
       try GIF then TIFFLZW then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then 

     If you want to save 24 bits image lossless
       try TIFFLZW or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       No one is better for true 24bits image

  6 I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images even 8 bits images

  7 Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8 This document is not well written If you have any PROBLEM SUGGESTION
     COMMENT about this program
     Please send to u7711501bicmoseenctuedutw 1401131113
     I need your suggestion to improve this program
     There is NO anonymous ftp on this site


8 Tech information
  Program user interface and some subroutines written by JihShin Ho
  Some subroutines are borrowed from XV221 and PBMPLUSdec 91
  TiffV32 and JpegV4 readingwriting are through public domain
    libraries
  Compiled with DJGPP
  You can get whole DJGPP package from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites
    For example wuarchivewustledu mirrorsmsdosdjgpp


9 For Thoese who want to modify video driver
   1 get GRX source code from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites
   2 For HiColor and TrueColor
        15 bits   of colors is set to 32768
        16 bits   of colors is set to 0xc010
        24 bits   of colors is set to 0xc018


Acknowledgment
  I would like to thank the authors of XV and PBMPLUS for their permission
    to let me use their subroutines
  Also I will thank the authors who write Tiff and Jpeg libraries
  Thank DJ Without DJGPP I cant do any thing on PC
