 Hi Im just getting into PoVRay and I was wondering if there is a graphic
 package that outputs POV files  Any help would be appreciated
 Thanks
 

A very good modeling package I found is irit look for irittarZ
However there is no converter from its format to POV format I postet 
a request for such a converter in this group but got no response
so Im considering to write such a program myself
