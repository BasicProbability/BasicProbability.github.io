 	Could somebody let me know of a drawing utility that can be
 used to manipulate postscript filesI am specifically interested in
 drawing lines boxes and the sort on Postscript contour plots
 	I have tried xfig and I am impressed by its features However
 it is of no use since I cannot use postscript files as input for the
 programmeIs there a utility that converts postscript to xfig format
 	Any help would be greatly appreciated

Have you checked out Adobe Illustrator There are a few Unix versions
for it available depending on your platform I know of two Unix versions
One for Mach NeXT and for Irix SGI There may be others such
as for Sun SparcStation but I dont know for sure

You can include postscript epsi files in xfig encapsulated postscript
info files You cant actually edit the postscript file but youre able
to draw over the postscript file

There a eps to epsi converter eps2epsi perl program

Succes
