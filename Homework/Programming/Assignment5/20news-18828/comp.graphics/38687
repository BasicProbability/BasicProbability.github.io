Subject Any good Morphing Anims


Has anyone created any interesting animations using Dmorph
I seem to be unable to create anything that looks remotely
realistic although this is probably due to the crappy GIFs
at I am using One of Captain Kirk and One of Spock im a
bit of a Trekker  What are the best type of pictures to use
thanks
