Subject Hiddenline removal program

Im posting this for a friend

  I have an immediate need for a polygonbased hiddenline removal  
  program  I can deal with any inputoutput format but I need to be able  
  to do perspective views in any orientation and range

  Is there a publicdomain hiddenline program around  It seems like  
  there should be but I have not been able to locate one

Email replies and I will summarize
Thanks
