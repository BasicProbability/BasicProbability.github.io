 An review of both the Mac and Windows versions in either PC Week or Info
 World this week said that the Windows version was considerably slower
 than the Mac  A more useful comparison would have been between PhotoStyler
 and PhotoShop for Windows  David
 

I dont know about thatIve used Photoshop 25 on both a 486dx50 and a Quadra
950Id say they are roughly equal  If anything the 486 was faster

Both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of RAM 16 megs
I also believe the quadra had one of those photoshop accelerators

I went back and looked at the review again  They claim there were
significant differences in manipulating a 27 meg test file but with
smaller files the two platforms were the about the same  David
