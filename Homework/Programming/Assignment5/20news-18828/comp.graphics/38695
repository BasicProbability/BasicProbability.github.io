Subject Re Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly

Ive been trying to figure out a way to get Adobe Illustrator
to autotrace exactly what I see on my screen But it misses
the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more  resulting in images
that are useless   I need exact tracing not approximate

Ive tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace
tolerances but it doesnt help Any suggestions

Ive had exactly the same problems in Aldus Freehand  I think autotracing
is one of those features that barely works but everybody feels compelled
to throw it in because the other guys are doing it
