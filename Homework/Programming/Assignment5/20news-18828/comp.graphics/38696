Subject Rayshade query

Hi there

I am very interested in Rayshade 400 I have managed to make a chessboard
for Rayshade Unfortunately I still have to do the knight horse Any ideas
I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces The board is marble
Unfortunately black wont work very well for the one side Anybody with ideas
for nice surfaces

I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
command Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this and I dont have
Craig Kolbs email address Anybody with ideas because this is essential
for my next venture into raytracing

Where should I post the finished chessboard

Is there anybody else using rayshade on nonUnix systems

How fast does Unix render

Thanks

Rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics but have no
artistic talent
