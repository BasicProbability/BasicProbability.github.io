 Hi netters

 	I am currently doing some investigations on Developable Surface
 Can anyone familiar with this topic give me some information or sources
 which can allow me to find some infomation of developable surface
 	Thanks for your help

A developable surface is st you can lay it or roll it flat on the
plane it may require you to give it a cut though

Eg a cylinder a cone a plane of course or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian intrinsic curvature ie with singular
Hessian the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch
are developable In more technical words a developable surface is
locally isometric to a plane at all points


Think also of the sphere or the earth which in a nondevelopable
whatever ways you cut it you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing

For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry
which treats surfaces 2D manifolds eg M do Carmos book

BookCarmo76Differential
  author       do Carmo Manfredo P
  title        Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces
  year         1976
  publisher    PrenticeHall
  note         503 pages

Enjoy
