 	I have seen several raytraced scenes from MTV or was it 
 RayShade with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image
 The fontschars had color depth and even textures associated with
 them  Now I was wondering is it possible to do the same in POV
 

Hi Noel

Ive made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts
triangulates them bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
3d object which could be used with PoV fi

The problem Im currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls Constrained delaunay may be okay but I have no code
example of how to do it

Another way to do the bartman may be

 TGA2POV
 A selfmade variation of this using heightfields

  Create a bw picture BIG of the text you need fi using a PostScript
  previewer Then use this as a heightfield If it is white on black
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts its still open
  on the backside To close it mirror it and compound it with the original

Example

object 
   union 
      heightfield  gif abp2gif 
      heightfield  gif abp2gif scale 1 1 1
   
   texture 
      Glass
   
   translate 05 0 05      center
   rotate 90 0 0              rotate upwards
   scale  10 5 100             scale bigger and thicker
   translate 0 2 0             final placement



abp2gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ABP black on white in
