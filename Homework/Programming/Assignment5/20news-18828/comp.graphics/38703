   Anyway still with 15Mhz you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
making cool awesome games read psygnosis

Speaking of Psygnosis they have licensed games to Philips Interative
Media International for CDI

The following was recently posted in a message in the CDI section of
the Multimedia Forum

Seventh Guest has been licensed by Virgin Games to Philips Interactive
Media International for worldwide CDI rights Were also licensed to
PIMI Litil Divil from Gremlin Graphics UK and Microcosm from
Psygnosis UK Those three titles will be adapted on CDI using the full
potential of the FMV cartridge meaning using the additional memory as
well as the motion video capabilities Those titles have been negociated
in Europe but will be available worldwide

Also Lemmings 1  2 have been licensed from Psygnosis as well as Striker
Soccer from Rage UK

I dont know when these titles will be available or when work on them even
started so dont expect your CDI retailer to have them yet

There was also some mention of future Nintendo CDI games in an issue of the
UK magazine ERT  Mario Hotel was mentioned as having 75 levels
