Subject Re SCF files help needed

From article 1993Apr210138461374cx5com by tlccx5com
 
 
 Ive got an old demo disk that I need to view It was made using RIX Softworks  
 The files on the two diskette set end with scf
 
 The demo was VGA resolution 256 colors but I dont know the spatial  
 resolution
 

According to my ColoRIX manual SCF files are 640x480x256

 First problem When I try to run the demo the screen has two black bars that  
 cut across horizontally the screen in the top third and bottom third of the  
 screen The bars are about 1inch wide Other than this the demo the  
 animation part seems to be running fine
 
 Second problem I cant find any graphics program that will open and display  
 these files I have a couple of image conversion programs none mention scf  
 files
 

You may try VPIC I think it handles the 256 color RIX files OK
