Subject Problems grabbing a block of a Starbase screen

At the moment im trying to grab a portion of a Starbase screen and store it
in an area of memory The data needs to be in a 24bit format which
shouldnt be a problem as the app is running on a 24 bit screen though
im not too fussy about the exact format

I actually intend to write the data out as a TIFF but that bits not the
problem

Does anyone out there know how to grab a portion of the screen The
blockread call seems to grab the screen but not in 24 bit colour
whatever the screenwindow type i get 1 byte per pixel 

thanks in advance

Martin
