Subject Re XV under MSDOS 

 Hi  Recently I found XV for MSDOS in a subdirectory of GNUCC GNUISH I 
 use frequently XV on a Sun Spark Station 1 and I never had problems but when I
 start it on my computer with h option it display the help menu and when I
 start it with a GIFFile my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come
 back
 
 My computer is a little 38625 with copro 4 Mega rams Tseng 4000 1M running
 MSDOS 50 with HIMEMSYS and no EMM386SYS I had the GO32EXE too but no
 driver who run with it
 
 Do somenone know the solution to run XV  any help would be apprecied
 		

You probably need an X server running on top of MS DOS  I use DesqviewX
but any MSDOS X server should do
