   CH Concerning the proposed newsgroup split I personally am not in

 Also it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
 groups is already plagued with megacrossposting thus the groupsplit
 would not in all likelihood bring about a more structured
 environment

Am I glad you write that I got flamed all along because I begged NOT to
crosspost some nonsense articles

The problem with crossposting is on the first poster I am aware that this
posting is a crossposting too but what else should one do You never know
where the interested people stay in

To split up newsgroups brings even more crossposting
