Subject Help  Miro Crystal or ATI GUP 



Im planning to buy a new VLBEISA system with a good graphic performance
So far I looked at the ATI GUP VLB as my favorite graphicscard But 
recently I heard something about a new card from  Miro It was the Miro
Crystal 24s with 3 MB and True Color support up to 1024x768 It costs just a
little more than the ATI So cant decide which one matches better my needs
Any technical references and performance comparisons especially from the
Miro card would be greatly appreciated
