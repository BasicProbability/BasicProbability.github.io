Subject POV problems with tga outputs

I cant fiqure this out  I have properly compiled pov on a unix machine
running SunOS 413  The problem is that when I run the sample pov files and
use the EXACT same parameters when compiling different tga outputs  Some
of the tgas are okay and others are unrecognizable by any software
