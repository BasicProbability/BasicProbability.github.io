Subject 48bit graphics


	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a
48bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or
something akin to that  Anyway he claimed it had 48bit color  a 12bit alpha channel  Thats
60 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  Specifically the 48bit color  Thats 280
trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an antialiasing thing  Or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor

	Also to settle a bet with my roommate what are SGIs flagship products  I know of
Iris Indigo and Crimson but what are the other ones and which is their topoftheline
sadly I have access to none of them  Just a DEC 500025  Sigh
