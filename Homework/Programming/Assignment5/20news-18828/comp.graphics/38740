Subject RE VGAScrolling 

Hi 

If you want to have SoftScrolling on your VGA you have to change some 
intern registers of the CRTC But it is a little bit difficult to explain 
so I would suggest you take a look at The Programming of the 
EGAVGAAdapter by AddisonWesley You will find all useful descriptions 
for every available VGARegister
