Subject Q TIFF description

Sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question but Im not
an computer graphic expert I want to read TIFFFiles with a PASCALprogram
The problem is that the files I want to read are in compressed form 
 code 1 eg Huffman  All books  articles I found describe only the
plain uncompressed format I dont know where to get the original
TIFF specification furthermore I havent any access to a realy complete
library Can anybody direct me to a good book or even better to an 
specification available via ftp 

Thanks in advance  Thomas Wolf

ps direct mail would be prefered
