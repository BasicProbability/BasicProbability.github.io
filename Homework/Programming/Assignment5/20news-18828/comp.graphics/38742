Yeah Corel Draw and WordPerfect Presentations pretty limited here too
	Since theres no not really such thing as a decent raster to
vector conversion program this tracing technique is about it  Simple
stuff like bw logos etc do pretty well while more complicated stuff
goes haywire  I suspect even though I dont write code that a good
bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most
of these application softwares were using  but even so how come one
hasnt been written to my knowledge  I mean even Hijaak one of the
commercial industry standards of file conversion hasnt attempted it yet
