Subject Povray problem  Please Help

Hello
    Ive recently had Povray draw about 10 sample files The problem is that
I accidently erased the command in my povraydef that made the image a targas
file So now the files are the dump format How do I fix these files with out
having to retrace them By fix I mean turn them into targas Thanks in
advance
                                                Jerry
