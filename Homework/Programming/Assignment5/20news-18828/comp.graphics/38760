Subject Re 3D2 files  what are they

doughparc0aushpcom Doug Parsons writes

I was chaining around in the anonymous ftp world looking for 3D Studio
meshes and other interesting graphical stuff for the program and found
a few files with the extension 3D2  My 3DS v201 doesnt know this type
of file so what are they

They are 3D object files for CAD 3D 20 a program written by Tom Hudson
for the Atari ST computers  Dont know much more about them except that
they are stored with the points first then the surfaces are next and are
made by listing 3 point numbers that make up the triangle surface Then
theres a header that describes coloring lighting etc  Dont know much
more than this hope this helps
