	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a
48bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or
something akin to that  Anyway he claimed it had 48bit color  a 12bit alpha channel  Thats
60 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  Specifically the 48bit color  Thats 280
trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an antialiasing thing  Or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor

Hmm 48 bit aye
Well it beats a 32bit design for thee sake of ellegance
48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour
The 248 nr of colours is a bit misleading It makes more sense to see it
as 65536 possible shades of pure red
This might actually make some sense since 256 shades of red 24 bit colours 
may produce visible jumps in intensity
Then again a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 
of doing colour graphics because it leaves ya such a tidy and fast program
code

	Take care
