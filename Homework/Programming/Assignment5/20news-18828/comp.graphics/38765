of these application softwares were using  but even so how come one
hasnt been written to my knowledge  I mean even Hijaak one of the
commercial industry standards of file conversion hasnt attempted it yet

Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years It does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs Of course a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace The problem that Ive run into though is that when it
creates a detailed trace it produces WAY more points than are necessary
If I trace something manually I use many less es points The problem
with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down especially
printing
