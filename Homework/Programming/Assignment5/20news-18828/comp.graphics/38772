Subject Hallusion info

Has anyone seen hallusions  You can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern
when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture  Im looking for
a program that generates these pictures  Theres a company in Texas that makes them but I 
doubt if theyre giving the program away  Any help would be appreciated
