Does anyone have any real experience with the Kubota KenaiDenali
series of graphics workstations  They pretty much blow the pants
off SGI machines and Sun machines in the same price point which
is about 50000 bucks  Real nice stuff but Ive only seen the
stuff on paper  Im wondering is there anything NOT to like  The
specs are too massive to get into here but if a summary is desired
I could be coaxed into uploading the spec sheet
