What kind of polygons  Shaded  Texturemapped  Hm  More comes into play with
fast routines than just polygons  It would be nice to know exaclty what
system VGA is a start but what processor and a few of the specifics of the
implementation  You need to give  more info if you want to get any answers P

I dont want texture mapped cause if I did Id asked for them   Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons  As for the processor itd
be for a minimum of a 286 maybe 386 if I cant find a good one for 286s
Ideally I want a polyn function that can clip to a userdefined viewport
and write to an arbitrary location in memory  Of course the chances of

Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters 
The polygons are all convex 
They have less than N sides you are drawing meshes walls doors etc

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave  self intersecting polygons 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line
Complex figure 8 type polygons can be a bit trickier

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons  

finding something like that are pretty remote so I guess Id need the source
with it  Oh and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise itd be too
slow  Ive seen some polygon routines in C and theyve all been waaay too
slow  Its for a 3D vector graphics program  Ive been hunting high and low

It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms
If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be


for a polyn function in ASM and I cant find one anywhere that I can use
Ive found one or two polyn functions but my ASM is pretty bad so I wont
even try to rewrite them
