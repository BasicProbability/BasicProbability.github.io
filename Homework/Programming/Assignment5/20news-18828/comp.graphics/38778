2 Drawing threedimensional objects on a twodimensional screen

The simple answer is you divide by the depth  For a more verbose
explanation see any of the above references starting with

The Foley  Van Dam  Feiner  Hughes Computer Graphics book is certainly
a good start  Chapter 6 is Viewing in 3D then read chapter 15
VisibleSurface Determination  For more information go to chapter 16 for
shading chapter 19 for clipping and branch out from there


3 Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits

Find a copy of Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display by
Paul Heckbert SIGGRAPH 82 Proceedings page 297  There are other
algorithms but this one works well and is fairly simple  Implementations
are included in most raster toolkits see item 7 below

A variant method is described in Graphics Gems p 287293  Note that
the code from the Graphics Gems series is all available from an FTP site
as described above

Check out John Bradleys Diversity Algorithm which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual

The ImageMagick package see section 7 for where it is contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the
other algorithms but slower

Theres also an implementation of

Wan Wong and Prusinkiewicz An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data
Clustering Transactions on Mathematical Software Vol 14 2 June 1988
pp 153162

avialable as princetonedupubGraphicscolorquantshar  This code
in modified form appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well


4 Converting color into grayscale

The NTSC formula is

    luminosity  299 red  587 green  114 blue


5 Quantizing grayscale to blackwhite

The only reference you need for this stuff is

    Digital Halftoning Robert Ulichney MIT Press 1987 ISBN 0262210096

But before you go off and start coding check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item 7 below  All of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to bw conversion


6 Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle

The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination
This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination  Instead
loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse
transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source
This method is quite general and can be used for any onetoone
2D mapping not just rotation  You can add antialiasing by doing
subpixel sampling

However there is a much faster method with antialising included
which involves doing three shear operations  The method was originally
created for the IM Raster Toolkit see below an implementation is
also present in PBMPLUS  Reference A Fast Algorithm for Raster
Rotation by Alan Paeth awpaethwatcglwaterlooedu Graphics
Interface 86 Vancouver  An article on the IM toolkit appears in
the same journal  An updated version of the rotation paper appears
in Graphics Gems see section 1 under the original title

Please do not post or mail messages saying I cant FTP could someone
mail this to me  There are a number of automated mail servers that will
send you things like this in response to a message  See item 13 below for
details on some

Also the newsgroup altgraphicspixutils is specifically for discussion
of software like this  You may find useful information there


8 Format documents for TIFF IFF BIFF NFF OFF FITS etc

You almost certainly dont need these  Read the above item 7 on free
image manipulation software  Get one or more of these packages and
look through them  Chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there  But if you still want one of the
format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhofcsriceedu in directory pubgraphicsformats

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct
This archive includes pixel formats and two and threedimensional object
formats  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as Mark
Hall foocsriceedu will apparently no longer be maintaining it

A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by Quincey Koziol koziolncsauiucedu  The latest version exists at
ftpncsauiucedu in miscfileformatsgraphicsformats  Apparently
neither of these is complete you might want to check both

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System Its a file format most
often used in astronomy  Despite the name it can contain not only images
but other things as well  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and
information posting on sciastrofits  read it if you want to know more



9 Converting between vector formats

A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript or MacDraw
to CGM or whatever  It is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item 7  Converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you
get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel  the basic objects
are the same for all image formats  This is not so for vector formats
The basic objects  circles ellipses dropshadowed patternfilled
roundcornered rectangles etc  vary from one format to another
Except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do
a onetoone conversion between vector formats

There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftppscedu  The
contributor states that it runs on Unix MSWindows and possibly the Mac
A better more specific blurb would be most welcome

On the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another
As far as I know no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
posted to compsourcesmisc  Check the index on your nearest archive
site

A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image  from PostScript to Sun raster format or HPGL to
X11 bitmap  For example some of the commercial PostScript clones for
PCs allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer  Also
the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Suns X11NeWs can
be used to render to a file if youre clever  But in general the
answer is no  However if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial

GNU ghostscript from the FSF  current version 252 includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as
a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter  It implements
essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript
and level 2

Allan Braunsdorf has this to say

At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts
for 25  That was a sale price  You can get it for slightly
more than that normally  35 maybe  I believe its
available from RenderMan Retail at Pixars address

    Pixar

    Richmond CA 94804
    510 2364000 
    510 2360388 FAX

You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains Luxo Jr Reds
Dream Tin Toy and Knicknack for 2500 plus 250 for shipping They
will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card I 
ordered mine just last week and received it several days later Dont expect 
to be able to rent a copy from your local video store According to the license
agreement printed on the back cover of the case it cannot be rented


11 How do I draw a circle as a Bezier or Bspline curve

The short answer is You cant  Unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle  The approximation may look acceptable
but it is sensitive to scale  Magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies  Deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large  If you want to
do the job right consult the article

  A Menagerie of Rational BSpline Circles
  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller
  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications volume 9 number 9
  September 1989 pages 4856

For rough nonrational approximations consult the book

  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture
  by I D Faux and M J Pratt
  Ellis Horwood Publishers Halsted Press John Wiley 1980

For the best known nonrational approximations consult the article

  Good Approximation of Circles by Curvaturecontinuous Bezier Curves

12 How to order standards documents

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards and also
ISO international standards  Their sales office is at 12126424900
mailing address is 1430 Broadway NY NY 10018  It helps if you have the
complete name and number

Some useful numbers to know

CGM Computer Graphics Metafile is ISO 86324 1987  GKS Graphical
Kernel System is ANSI X31241985  PHIGS Programmers Hierarchical
Interactive Graphics System is ANSI X31441988  IGES is ASMEANSI
Y1426M1987  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers
for example the GKS FORTRAN binding is X312411985

Standardsinprogress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public this includes you  ANSI can let
you know where to order them most are available from Global Engineering
at 18008547179


13 How to FTP by email

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like send compsourcesunixfbm
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail

In addition there is at least one FTPbymail server  Send mail to
ftpmaildecwrldeccom saying help and it will tell you how to use
it  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse


14 How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon

Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way
the point is within the polygon  If the ray crosses an even number of
edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges  This idea is known in
the trade as the Jordan curve theorem see Eric Haines article in
Glassners ray tracing book above for more information including
treatment of special cases

Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon  If the sum is 2 pi the point is inside
if the sum is 0 the point is outside  However this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly

Code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in
the Ray Tracing News Vol 5 No 3 available from princetonedu
pubGraphicsRTNewsRTNv5n3Z


15 How to tessellate a sphere

One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles  The
base of the recursion is an octahedron and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones  Jon Leech leechcsuncedu
has posted a nice routine called spherec that generates the coordinates
Its available for FTP on ftpeelblgov and princetonedu

19 Graphics mailing lists

There are a variety of graphicsrelated mailing list out there each
covering either a single product or a single topic  I have been an
active participant in one of these for some time now and find the
focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
to be nothing short of amazing

20 Specific references on file formats

    Graphics File Formats David Kay and John Levine WindcrestMcGrawHill
      1992 ISBN 0830630597 paper ISBN 0830630600 3695 hardcover
      ISBN 0830630597 2495 paper  Comments  26 formats no software
      this is good IMHO  I prefer books which are nonplatformdependent
      Questions about this book may be sent to gbookiecccambridgemaus


21 What about GIF

GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format  It is portable and usable upon
a wide variety of platforms  It is quite limited in some ways yes the
keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all and in fact I dont like
it much  However it looks to me like the mostFrequently Asked Question
which was not previously covered in this list  The following is a list
of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF

22 What is morphing

Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new
location Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one
Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
morphing This is available for anonymous ftp from marshcscurtineduau
in the directory pubgraphicsbibliographyMorph There are three files

        morphintropsZ     PostScript version many pictures  15M
        morphintrotxtZ    text version
        mresponsesZ        Responses to morphing questions

The files are compressed so you must use binary transfer and
uncompress them afterwards


23 How to raytrace height fields

Height fields are a special case in raytracing  They have a number of uses
such as terrain rendering and some optimization is possible  Thus they
get their own FAQ section  Note that further references can no doubt be
located via the raytracing bibs in section 16 above

The following paper seems to be the definitive reference

F Kenton Musgrave
Grid Tracing Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields
July 1988
musg88psZ

This is available as Research Report YALEUDCSRR639 from Yale University
its also in the SIGGRAPH 91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and
Imaging course notes and best of all its available on the net

24 How to find the area of a 3D polygon

	The area of a triangle is given by in C notation

     area  05    x0  y1    x1  y2    x2  y0  
	             x1  y0    x2  y1    x0  y2  

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

     area  00

     for  i  0 i  n  1 i 
         area   xi  yi  1    xi  1  yi 
     area   xn  1  y0    x0  yn  1 
     area  20

If the area is a negative number the polygon or triangle is
clockwise if positive it is counterclockwise

From Ronald Golmans Gem in Graphics Gems II  see section 1 above Area
 of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra

The area of a polygon P0 P1 P2  Pn not in the xy plane is
given by

     AreaPolygon  12   N  Sigma  Pk x Pk1  

where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal
vertex  The  represents the dot product operator and the x
represents the cross product operator  Sigma represents the summation
operator    represents the absolute value operator  Pn1 is equal
to P0


25 How to join ACMSIGGRAPH

Probably the easiest way to join ACMSIGGRAPH is to trot over to your
local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM
Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank
Fill it out and mail it in  ACM membership for students costs 2300

SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional 1600 2600 for
Voting or Associate Members also yearly  To get TOG Transactions
on Graphics its another 2600 for students and 3100 for Voting or
Associate Members

If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM itll cost you
5900 no student discount

There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications
