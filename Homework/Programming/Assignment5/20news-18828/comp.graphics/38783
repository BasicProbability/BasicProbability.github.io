Hi Folks

   Does anyone have a copy of Playmation theyd be willing to sell me  Id 
love to try it out but not for the retail 

Playmation is available direct from Anjon  Associates for 299  Its hard
to beat that price  Also youd be better off with a newer version than
an older version that had bugs that have long since been clobbered  


   Thanks in advance
