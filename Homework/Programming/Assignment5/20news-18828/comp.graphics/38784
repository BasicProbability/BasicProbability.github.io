 	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a reference to a
 48bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to remember it being called IMAGE or
 something akin to that  Anyway he claimed it had 48bit color  a 12bit alpha channel  Thats
 60 bits of infowhat could that possibly be for  Specifically the 48bit color  Thats 280
 trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an antialiasing thing  Or
 is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor


	Im pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific 
systems ie photo processing gear use as much as 96 bits of color info
Why Why not oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the
hardwares only task is image manipulation and profressional photographers
demand professional results

 	Also to settle a bet with my roommate what are SGIs flagship products  I know of
 Iris Indigo and Crimson but what are the other ones and which is their topoftheline
 sadly I have access to none of them  Just a DEC 500025  Sigh

	Strange question but anyway theres the VGX line the newer
Indigo2 and the Onyx systems are the new big boys on the block you
can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance of
a reality engine Theres more but I dont have my handy periodic 
table of sgis on me
