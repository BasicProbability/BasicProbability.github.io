 Has anyone seen hallusions  You can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern
 when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture  Im looking for
 a program that generates these pictures  Theres a company in Texas that makes them but I 
 doubt if theyre giving the program away  Any help would be appreciated 
 
There is a program included with the book Virtual Reality Playhouse which
will let you generate these pictures  Its not a very powerful program but
it does an acceptable job for experimentation purposes
