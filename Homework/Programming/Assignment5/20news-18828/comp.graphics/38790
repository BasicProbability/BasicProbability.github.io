Subject RE 48 bit graphics


A good reason which is why many companies use it for 48 bits  pixel
is so you can use double buffering for animating scenes  ie you have
2  24bit planes You write to the one in the background and then FLIP 
 the entire screen updates to the second imageplane The screen updates 
in one refresh and you dont see different objects appearing in the order 
that theyre drawn as in the CADMacDraw effect Now your ready to update 
the image that used to be in the foreground

About the SG product line who can even keep track nowadays Every co seems
to as their ads  press releases claim redefine computing etc etc as
we know it with each new product Progress and competition are great but who
wants to invest in a system thats obsolete by the time it reaches your desk
