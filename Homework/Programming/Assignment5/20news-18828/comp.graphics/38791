Subject Re Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly

In article 0010580BvmcbrtdiabloUUCP diabloUUCPcboesel Charles Boesel writes
Ive been trying to figure out a way to get Adobe Illustrator
to autotrace exactly what I see on my screen But it misses
the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more  resulting in images
that are useless   I need exact tracing not approximate

Ive tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace
tolerances but it doesnt help Any suggestions


Buy Adobe Streamline  Problem solved
