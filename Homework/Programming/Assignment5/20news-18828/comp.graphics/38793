Subject Re Fast polygon routine needed

In article 1rguqoINNrcednaccswineduau alansaturncsswinOZAU Alan Christiansen writes
I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave  self intersecting polygons 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line
Complex figure 8 type polygons can be a bit trickier

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concavemulti outline
algorithm but not tremendously faster  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about 10 faster  This is
all C on HP PARISC the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as
fast as possible as far as I could tell  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex  Definitely the
way to go

ps sorry but my code CANNOT be made public domain
