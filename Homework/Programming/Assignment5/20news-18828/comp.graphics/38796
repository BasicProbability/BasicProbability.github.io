 Has anyone got multiverse to work 
 
 I have built it on 486 svr4 mips svr4s and Sun SparcStation
 
 There seems to be many bugs in it  The dogfight and dactyl simply do nothing
 After fixing a bug where a variable is defined twice in two different modules  One needed
 setting to static  else the client coredumped

Ive tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 222  After
fixing up a few bugs 3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
other things I got it to compile  link but after starting client
 server I just get a black window sometimes the client core dumps
sometimes the server sometimes I get a broken pipe sometimes it
just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
cursor to become a crosshair in dogfight but thats it  Ive
sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week but
no reply as yet
