Wow A 68070 Id be very interested to get my hands on one of these
especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
68060 which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup 8D

The 68070 is made by someone other than Motorola Signetics perhaps
and was if memory serves me correctly a 68000 compatible single chip
micro type chip IE built in extra toys like serial ports ram
interfaces etc So laugh all you want but there is such a critter
