Subject patches for SUNGKS41 




Due to a number of bugs in GKS41 under SUNOS 413 I installed
patches 10053315 and 10075501 Patch 10053315 appears to
work fine and has fixed a number of problems Patch 10075501
however which is required to fix a number of other annoying
bugs breaks with our applications

Is there a more recent revision of patch 10075

Any other ideas
