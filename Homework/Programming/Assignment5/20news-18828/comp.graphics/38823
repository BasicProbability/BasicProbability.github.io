Subject Re Adobe Photo Shop type software for UnixXMotif platforms


In article C5w8xBIv6worldstdcom wdmworldstdcom Wayne Michael writes

    I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and
    manipulation package for UnixXMotif platforms that is comparable
    to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac

Corel Draw 4 will be able to do this as it will include the Photopaint stuff that 
the PC version got with version 3 Dont hold your breath though
