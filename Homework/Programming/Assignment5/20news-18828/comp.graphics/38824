	I was recently talking to a possible employer  mine   and he made a
reference to a 48bit graphics computerimage processing system  I seem to
remember it being called IMAGE or something akin to that  Anyway he claimed
it had 48bit color  a 12bit alpha channel  Thats 60 bits of infowhat
could that possibly be for  Specifically the 48bit color  Thats 280
trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve  Is this an
antialiasing thing  Or is this just some magic number to make it work better
with a certain processor

Well 48 bit colour could be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision More than that would seem to be wasted

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range  RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding

Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit 8 bits per component
frame buffers This set up called double buffering allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous
frame is displayed This makes for smoother animation

sadly I have access to none of them  Just a DEC 500025  Sigh

Well hey if you want to brag about numbers the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo
card with 96 bits per pixel Full double buffering Two 24 bit buffers a 24
bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation
