Subject Re Turning photographic images into thermal print andor negatives

    Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear
from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you
use andor any peripherals or software  It seemed the Quadra 800 would be
my best bet to modify photographic images  I am planning on buying a Quadra
800 with 32Megs of RAM a 510Meg Hard Drive a 1200 dpi scanner 17 Sony 
monitor and a 88Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM  I am new to
computers and any advice would be great
 
well i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering
them  as for changing them back into negatives is that really possible
scanning and altering is no big deal i dont know what types of
features you have in your version of photoshop  but the one i use
which incidentally is on a quadra has gallery effects and all types
of other neato stuff
im just wondering why you would want to put your images back into
negatives because once you print the image outthats your print
do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this  like are you
doing this just for fun for a business to gain more computer
knowledge for a project youre working on
otherwise i guess i dont know if id be helping or not by posting info
on scanning and stuff
ok  cool
