Subject re TIFF complexity


	Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasnt dealt with
	CGM ASN1 CDA DCA SGML or any one of a number of other
	very successful file format  People seem perfectly capable
	dealing with these others  Dealing with the format of TIFF
	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the DCT LZW and
	FAX encoding of the image data  The majority of the libraries
	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather
	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters

	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather
	simpleminded formats such as GIF PCX and BMP but to suggest
	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous

	That doesnt mean that GIF isnt fine but dont even thing about
	using it in many instances  GIF is very nice for use in lowend
	photos applications and for screen grabs and such but it would
	never do for highvolume or highresolution systems  FAX is nice
	but it doesnt do color and GIF doesnt do BW all that well
	JPEG is nice for highresolution color but is slow for lowend

	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle
	all these situations and then some  Naturally its more complex
	But Ild rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging
	systems based on having to deal with 34 file formats anyday

	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes
	but please dont wrail against its complexity  The complexity
	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and
	doesnt come close to the complexity found in most commercially
	viable file formats


	If were in philosophical arguments against complexity lets all
	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length
	encoding
