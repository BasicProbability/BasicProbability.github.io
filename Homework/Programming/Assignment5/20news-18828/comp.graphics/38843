rendering include

        o  Pencil and graph paper doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using
             Painters algorithm
             BSP trees
             Z buffer
             Other

        o  Raytracing

        o  Radiosity

        o  Holographic projection to film
