                          Request For Discussion
                                for the
                          OPEN  TELEMATIC GROUP

                                  OTG

I have proposed the forming of a consortiumtask force for the
promotion of NAPLPSJPEG FIF to openly discuss ways method
proceduresalgorythms applications implementation extensions of
NAPLPSJPEG standards  These standards should facilitate the creation
of REALTIME Online applications that make use of Voice Video
Telecommuting HiRes graphics Conferencing Distant Learning Online
order entry Faxin addition these dicussion would assist all to
better understand how SGML CALS ODA MIME OODBMS JPEG MPEG
FRACTALS SQL CDrom cdromXA Kodak PhotoCD TCL VFAST and
EIATIA562 can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
TELEMATICMultimedia applications

We want to be able to support DOS UNIX MAC WINDOWS NT OS2
platforms  It is our hope that individuals developers corporations
Universities R  D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor

This would be a NOTFORPROFIT group with bylaws and charter Already
many corporations have decided to support OTG Open TELEMATIC Group so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject  If
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below

This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPSJPEG
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version  We urge all who wants to
see CMCs HiRes based applications  the NAPLPSJPEG G R O W decide to
join and mutually benefit from this NOTFORPROFIT endeavor

NOTE Telematic has been defined by Mr James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice Video Hires Graphics Fax IVR Music over telephone
      linesLAN
