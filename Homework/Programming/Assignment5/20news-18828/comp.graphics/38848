From steinwatsonibmcom Arthur Stein
Subject Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists
Similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using dataflow programming
IBM Visualization Data Explorer software and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources including video
recording equipment
 
Audience  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating stateoftheart
           computer graphics into their research computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           firstcome firstserved basis
 
Level     Graduateadvanced undergraduate 1 or 2 Credits May be taken
           without credit as a workshop Calculus linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required Familiarity with Unix
           Xwindows and C is useful but not required
 
Date   June 1425 1993  2 Credits
        June 1418 1993  1 or 0 credits
 
Time   MonFri 900 am to 1200 pm and 100 pm to 400 pm
 
Cost   0 or 1 credit       410
        2 credits           820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered
