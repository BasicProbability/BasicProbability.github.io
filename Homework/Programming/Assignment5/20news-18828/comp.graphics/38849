	Hi
	Does anybody know any reliable utils to read english texts with scanner
	I want some analysis on quality of recognition because I want to read
	texts which I get by fax  you know  quality on faxes is rather bad 
	The scanner I have is BW and 300dpi But if there exist any good software
	that needs other specifications that will be OK
	
	Please send messages to my Email or on conference server Ill summarize
	them and consider your recomendations
	
	THANK YOU
