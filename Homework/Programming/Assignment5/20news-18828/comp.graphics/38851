Items Changed


REARRANGED the subjects in order to fir better in the 63Karticle limit
I PLAN ON CHANGING HEADERS SOON SO BE CAREFUL ONLY THE Resource Listing
keys are sure to remain in the Subject line

This is mainly a guide for computer graphics software
I would suggest reading the Comp Graphics FAQ for image analysis stuff

Its entitled 
 date compgraphics Frequently Asked Questions FAQ

 John T Grieggs grieggsjpldevvaxjplnasagov is the poster of the
 official compgraphics FAQ

I have included my comments within braces  and

To get help type help
You can get xarchie or archie which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session
Xarchie is on the X11R5 contrib tape and archie on compsourcesmisc
vol 27

To get information on how to use Archie via email send mail with
subject help to archie account at any of above sites

Note to JanetPSS users  the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host docicacuk 000005102000
Connect to it and specify archie as the host name and archie as
the username



2 Notes

Excerpted from the FAQ article

Please do not post or mail messages saying I cant FTP could
someone mail this to me  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like send compsourcesunixfbm
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail

TDDD

Its a library of 3D objects with translators tofrom OFF NFF
Rayshade Imagine or vort objects
Edited copy of the announcement follows from Raytracing News V43

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP by Steve Worley
  worleycupportalcom

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD These objects range from human figures to airplanes
  from semitrucks to lampposts  These objects are all freely
  distributable and most have READMEs that describe them

  In order to convert these objects to a humanreadable format a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB officially
  on hubcapclemsonedu that will convert ala PBM tofrom various
  object formats  Imagine TTDDD extension of TDDD OFF NFF
  Rayshade 40 or vort Source included for AmigaUnix as executables
  for the Amiga Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript

P3D

  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store threedimensional models A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release so there is no need to
  have access to any vendors lisp to run this software

  The mousedriven user interfaces for Motif Open Look and Silicon
  Graphics GL and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers  They are
  Painter  Painters Algorithm Dore Silicon Graphics Inc GL language
  Generic Phigs Sun Phigs DEC Phigs Rayshade ART ray tracer from
  VORT package and Pixar RenderMan

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftppscedu directory pubp3d and nicfunetfi directory
  pubgraphicsprogramsp3d

RenderMan

  Pixars RenderMan is not free  call Pixar for details



8 Solids description formats


a EECs ESPRIT project 322 CADI CAD Interfaces has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data curves surfaces and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA Computer Aided
  Analysis an CAM Computer Aided Manufacturing

b IGES v 51 now tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models  Brep and CSG The current standard number is ANSI Y1426M1987
  For documentation you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards 18002256242 ext 325
  and the cost is 100
  This standard is not available in electronic format

c PDESSTEP  This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information but also for things like FEM etc
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptservercmenistgov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body NOT the Subject area of the message

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab  are also working
  on STEP tools they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser
  both available in source form and for free for research purposes
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESSbased database system
