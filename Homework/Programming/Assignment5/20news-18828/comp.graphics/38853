 From DrDobbs 198 March 1993 

      The US Defense Mapping Agency in cooperation with their counterpart
agencies in CANADA the UK and Australia have released the Digital Chart
of the World DCW This chart consists of over 15 gigabytes of reasonable
quality vector data distributed on four CDROMS  includes coastlines
rivers roads railrays airportscities towns spot elevations and depths
and over 100000 place names

It is ISO9660 compatible and only 20000 available from

Fractal Landscape Generators


Public Domain

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourkeccu1aukuniacnz Paul D Bourke
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers Check with Archie

CIA World Map II

  NOTE this database is quite out of date and not topologically structured
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World This 11M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agencys ONCs and will be available together with
  searching and viewing software on a number of CDROMs later this summer 

  Check into HANAUMASTANFORDEDU and UCSDEDU see ftp list above
  The CIA database consists of coastlines rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes Also on hanaumastanfordedu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude
 
  A program for decoding the database mfil can be found on the machine
  pi1arcumnedu 1376613011
  Theres another program which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance but you can use regular polylines Ask
  Joe Stewart joeslpiliantcom
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it
  was posted in compsourcesunix To be more exact youll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines not the whole package

NCAR data

  NCAR National Center for Atmospheric Research has many types of
  terrain  data ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions to information about soil types vegetation etc
  This data is not free  they charge from 40 to 90 or more depending
  on the data volume and media exabyte tape 3480 cartridge 9track tape
  IBM PC floppy and FTP transfer are all available  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented not hobbyist oriented  For more information
  email to ilanancarucaredu

UNC data tapes with voxel data

  There are 2 public domain tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms mainly MRI and CT
  scans These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC  Chapel Hill
  softlabcsuncedu

  The data sets volume I and II are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicroncsuncedu 128109136159 in pubsoftlabCHVRTD

 First check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above

24bit scanning

  Get a good 24bit scanner like Epsons Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News Volume 4 3 
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings etc from doll
  house supplies
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that dont have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area

Books with textures

  Find some housesbooksmagazines that carry photographic material
  Educorp 16195369999 sells CDROMS with various imagery  also
  a wide variety of stock art is available
  Stock art from bigname stock art houses such as Comstock
  UNIPHOTO and Metro Image Base is available

  In Italy theres a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work Their address is
	Edition Belvedere Co Ltd
	00196 Rome Italy
	Piazzale Flaminio 19
	Tel 06 3604488 Fax 06  3602960

14 Introduction to rendering algorithms


a RayTracing


  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics No Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains For RayTracing I would
  suggest
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing Andrew Glassner ed Academic Press
     1989 ISBN 0122861604
  Note that I have not read the book but I feel that you cant be wrong
  using his book An errata list was posted in compgraphics by Eric Haines
  ericheyecom

Theres a more concise reference also

  Roman Kuchkuda  UNC  Chapel Hill An Introduction to Ray Tracing in
  Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD ed RAEEarnshaw
  NATO AS Vol F40 pp 10391060 Printed by SpringerVerlag 1988

It contains code for a small but fundamentally complete raytracer

b Zbuffer depthbuffer


A good reference is

        Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics David F Rogers
        McGrawHill New York 1985 pages 265272 and 280284

15 Where can I find the geometric data for the


a Teapot 


Displays on Display column of IEEE CGA Jan 87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newells teapot The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot

IEEE CGA Sep 87 in Jim Blinns column Jim Blinns Corner describes
an another way to model the teapot Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects so youre advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution around 8x8x4 triangles meshing per patch
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution

b Space Shuttle 


Tolis Lerios tolisnovastanfordedu has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles Heres a summary From his scispace list

model1
A modified version of the newsgroup model model2

406 vertices 296 useful ie referred to in the polygon descriptions
389 polygons 233 3vertex 146 4vertex 7 5vertex 3 6vertex
Payload doors nonexistent
Units unknown

Simon Marshall SMarshallsequentcchullacuk has a copy He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it

model2
The newsgroup model in OFF format You can find it in

gondwanaecrmuozau  file puboffobjectsshuttlegeo
hanaumastanfordedu   pubgraphicsCompgraphicsobjectsshuttledata

model3
The triangles model

This model is stored in several files each defining portions of the model

Greg Henderson hendersinfonodeingrcom has a copy  He did
not mention any restriction on the models distribution

model4
The NASA model

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations

x offset y offset z offset

From then on the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices
2748 polygons 407 3vertex 2268 4vertex 33 5vertex 14 6vertex
 10 7vertex 8 8vertex 8 12vertex 2 13vertex 2 15vertex
 17 16vertex 2 17vertex 2 18vertex 3 19vertex 8 24vertex
Payload doors closed
Units inches

Jon Berndt jonl14h11jscnasagov seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info unknown

model5
The old shuttle model

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

104 vertices
452 polygons 11 3vertex 41 4vertex
Payload doors open
Units meters

We have been using this model at STAR Labs Stanford University for
some years now Contact me tolisnovastanfordedu or my supervisor
Scott Williams scottstar5stanfordedu if you want a copy



16 Image annotation software


a Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good  It reads in
  rasterfiles but even if your image isnt normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile

b Idraw part of Stanfords InterViews distribution can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool  Im not
  sure exactly what they are
  You can ftp the idraws binary from interviewsstanfordedu

c Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap xbm
  and X11 pixmap xpm formats  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm
  Tgifs sources are available in the pub directory on csuclaedu
  Version 212 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9

d Use the editimage facility of KHOROS see below
  This is just one utility in the overall system you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdrawtype graphics using this package

e You might be able to get by with PBMPlus  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image

f ice requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3Its a PostScriptbased
  graphical editorand its available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eosoesthawaiiedu 12817115112 Requires Sun C 20 and

  ice means Image Composition Environment and its an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing

g Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pulldown menu  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats  ImageMagick is available as
  exportlcsmitedu contribImageMagicktarZ or at your nearest

WIT

  In a nutshell its a package of the same genre as AVSExploreretc
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system IMHO
  Major elements are

   a visual programming language which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
   a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point filter io transform
  morphological segmentation and measurement operations
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast merge
  synchronization conditional and sequencing control strategies

  WIT delivers an objectoriented distributed visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CADlike workspace by adding their
  own operators C functions objects data structures and servers
  specialized hardware WIT runs on Sun HP90007xx SGI and supports
  Datacube MV20200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in realtime

IDLSIPS

  A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS This was
  developed at the University of Colorado Boulder by some people working
  for Alex Goetz  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it  Its a few thousand dollars American I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free  Those are the general
  purpose packages Ive heard of besides what TerraMar has
  SIPS was written for AVIRIS imagery  Im not sure how general purpose
  it is  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask  I
  have another piece of software PCW that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification you can compute an image using selected components  Ive
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card  It will work without it but large
  images take quite a while 5070 times as long to process  Thats a
  freebie if you want it

  My  favorite is IDL Interactive Data Language from Research Systems
  Inc  IDL is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier Its
  programming language is very strong and easy  very Pascallike It
  handles the numbercrunching very well also Personally I like doing
  the numbercrunching with IDL on the VAX or Mathematica Igor or even
  Excel on the Mac if its not too hairy then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldnt handle and the speed and ease of use
  compared to IRAF was incredible By the way its mostly astronomical
  image processing which Ive been doing This means image enhancement
  cleaning up bad linespixels and some other traditional image
  processing routines Then for example taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse then doing a curve
  fit to that line which I might do like in KaleidaGraph 

 For IDL call Research Systems  for PVWAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado  Boulder  From what I can
 understand you can get packaged programs from Research Systems though

GVLware Distribution
        Bob   An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz   A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol  Motif color editor


The Army High Performance Computing Research Center AHPCRC has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab GVL we are using
these tools along side standard packages such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit to render 3D volumes and create digital movies
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called GVLware

GVLware currently consisting of Bob Raz and Icol is now available
via ftp  The most interesting program is probably Bob an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen enabling movies larger than memory to be played  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz  Source and
prebuilt binaries for IRIX 405 are included

To acquire GVLware anonymous ftp to
        machine  ftparcumnedu

        Motif interface SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 01 to 10 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering in perspective
            only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris
        Data must be a Brick of Bytes on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation subvolumes subsampling stereo

Some Raz features
        Motif interface SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition then streams to screen
            requires an empty disk partition to be set aside

19 GIS Geographical Information Systems software


GRASS

  Geographic Resource Analysis Support System of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab CERL It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because its public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration  You then compile the source code for your machine using
  scripts provided with GRASS  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget GRASS is not very
  userfriendly compared to Macintosh software A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines fft Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp in
  Boulder CO is a primary user of GRASS   This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multispectral 238 bands  volumetric
  rendering full color on Suns and Stardents It was a really effective
  interface  Vexcel Corp currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps You can call them
  at 303 4440094 or email care of gregvexcelcom 192929068

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run AUX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data GRASS  is publicdomain and can run on a highend PC
  under UNIX It is rasterbased has some imageprocessing capability
  and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment I have used GRASS V3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use It is best of course for data that are well represented
  in raster gridcell form

Microstation Imager

  Intergraph based in Huntsville Alabama sells a wide range of GIS
  softwarehardware Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GISremote sensing flavor

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations flip mirror rotate generalized affine
  Rectification Affine 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion  Principal component analysis
  Classification Kmeans and isodata  Fourier Xforms Forward filtering
  and reverse  Filters High pass low pass edge enhancing median
  generic  Complex HistogramContrast control  Layer Controller manages
  up to 64 images at a time  user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle
  VERY LARGE images and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun
  though there  were rumors there are always rumors that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment

PCI

  A company called PCI Inc out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada makes
  an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard
  formats LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget  The software is available in versions for MSDOS Unix
  workstations among them HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly
  other platforms by now  I use the VMS version

  The PCI software consists of several classesgroupspackages of
  utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common PCI
  database disk file  The Tape IO package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remotesensing industry tape
  formats INTO or write those formats out FROM the PCI database file
  this is the only package I use or know much about  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCIsupported thirdparty color displays output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer eg an Epsontype
  dotmatrix graphics printer  You might be more spe cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and
  Fourier analysis equalization userspecified operations eg
  multiply channel 1 by 3 add channel 2 and store as channel 5 and
  God only knows what all else  theres a LOT  I dont have and dont
  use these so cant say much about them you only buy the packages your
  particular applicationinterest calls for

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from
  a common parameter file which must be in VMS anyway in your default
  directory  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBMPC BASIC but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions  In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure  Theres
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with read fromwrite to the PCI
  data structures database file parameter file

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remotesensing images but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the
  level where you can handle rs images you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well  For instance the Tape IO package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multiband what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different
  interleave orders This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphicarts industrys CT2T format would probably I havent tried
  handle Targa and so on Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOURE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over  Its worth noting that the PCI database file is designed to
  contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table landuse and all manner of
  other information I observe that a remotesensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude
  longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this
  can go into the PCI database

  I believe that on workstations the builtin display is used  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  thirdparty display systems the name GouldDeanza seems to come to
  mind  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI database file to a Peritek VCTQ Qbus
  24bit DirectColor display subsystem  PCI software COULD be overkill
  in your case it seems designed for the very high end
  applicationsusers ie those for whom a MacPC largely doesnt suffice
  although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time  Its
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada a country which
  does a LOT of its landresource management via remote sensing I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas

SPAM Spectral Analysis Manager

  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM Spectral Analysis
  Manager which got a fair amount of use at the time  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery byte data  256 pixels
  across by  512 lines by  256 bands a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer which uses much larger images

  Spam does none of these things rectification classification PC and
  IHS transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays
  Actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  stretching  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR an executive based on TAE and may also require a frame
  buffer  I can refer you to people if youre interested  PCW requires X
  for display
