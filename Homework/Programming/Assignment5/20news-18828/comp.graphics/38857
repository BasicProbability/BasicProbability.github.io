Subject Raytriacing and animation


Now I have a couple raytracing questions
Just so you know Im using PovRay 10 both MSdos and Unix and Im generating Targa files of varying size

1 ok so I can view these wonderful pictures on my screen  Whats the best way  to get them on to paper  Would it be possible to take it to Kinkos and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it

2 I was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced 
frames  Is this a bad idea  Any tricks to it

 How would I get a sequence of targa files made into an animation 
that I could put on a videotape  Is there a cheap way
