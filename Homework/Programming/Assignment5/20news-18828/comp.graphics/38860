Hello
I have some problem in converting tga filegenerated by POVray to
rle file When I convert I do not get any warning message But
if I use xloadimagegetx11 something is wrong

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but I do not spend
time to install them Even I do not want to generate rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle if possiblergb to rle works but
it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file say cat  rawtorle  rleflip 
Does any body out there have same experienceproblems 


Well for starters why use rle files  You might have a specific program that
needs them OK but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format thus a 24meg
24bit targa file becomes a 80k or less 24bit jpeg

The latest versions of XV 221  and xloadimage 303 both handle jpeg files
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the cdjpeg suit  Even at 90
quality you cant see the difference the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an 8bit gif

Laterish
