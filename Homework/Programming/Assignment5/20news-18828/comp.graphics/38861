Subject Kubota KenaiDenali specs


Okay I got enough replies about the Kubota KenaiDenali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities  I havent actually used one
or seen one so take the specs with a grain of salt  Id like to see
an independent review of one against say an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something

Basically the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF1  DECs  and will likely run Windows NT in the future  They are
binary compatible with Digitals OSF1 Alpha AXP implementation  Denali
is their graphics subsystem which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding transformation engines

The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation
and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation


			3400			3500

GRAPHICS

Transform Modules	16			16
Frame Buffer Modules	51020			51020
Frame Buffer		1280x1024x24bit		1280x1024x24bit
			double buffered		double buffered
Zbuffer		24bit			24bit
Alphastencil		8bit			8bit
Stereo support		yes			yes
Other				both machines will double buffer or do
				stereo output per window  Both have an
				auxiliary video output that is RS170A
				NTSC and PAL

STORAGE

Internalfixed		2 35			4 35
Internalremovable	1 525			2 525
Max capacity		95GB			116 GB

IO

Both have TurboChannel 100MBsec SCSI2 Ethernet and FDDI

APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

Both have libraries for Xlib Motif MIT PEXlib DECPEXlib DECPHIGS and GL

Okay now the real stuff  The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as Denali  The Denali comes in three models the E P and V  They
use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz  Their
capabilities are as follows

As you can see these are pretty powerful workstations and the best part
is the pricing  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information
Their number is 4087278100  Im sure theyll send you an information you
may want  Oh some prices

Lowend

Kenai 3400 E Series w 1 TEM and 5 FBM  27795 dollars US
Kenai 3500 E Series w 1 TEM and 5 FBM  45345 dollars US

Highend

Kenai 3400 V Series w 6 TEM and 20 FBM  61795 dollars US
Kenai 3500 V Series w 6 TEM and 20 FBM  79345 dollars US

If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or
something I would appreciate it

Hope this helps someone out there

PS I am not affiliated with Kubota in any way  Hell I thought they made
tractors or something
