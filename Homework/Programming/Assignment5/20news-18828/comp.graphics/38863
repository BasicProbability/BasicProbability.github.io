Subject Looking for code to brake image into subbands


Hi all
	I am working on a project in which I need to brake an image
into subbands and then work with them  Since I have never done
anything like this dont even understand the concept of subbands I
was wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me
to do this  Any hints
Thanks
