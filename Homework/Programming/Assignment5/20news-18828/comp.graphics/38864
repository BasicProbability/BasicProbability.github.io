 Ive tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 222  After
 fixing up a few bugs 3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
 other things I got it to compile  link but after starting client
  server I just get a black window sometimes the client core dumps
 sometimes the server sometimes I get a broken pipe sometimes it
 just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
 cursor to become a crosshair in dogfight but thats it  Ive
 sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week but
 no reply as yet

Ive discovered a bug in the librariesparserparserc loadcolour function where it was generating a segmentation fault  It appears the colourList is geting corrupted somehow  I had it return random colours instead and everything worked great except for a few colour problems so I know its the only thing wrong

The colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the name of the colours are compared it crashes  I havent found the problem yet maybe someone else can
