   OK with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime
   the effects of scaling and so on I thought Id do some more tests

   First of all I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
   realistic The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it it was a
   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor
   I decided something a little longer would give closer to realworld results
   for better or for worse

   I pulled out a copy of 2001 A Space Odyssey that I had recorded off TV
   a while back About fifteen minutes into the movie theres a sequence where
   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station Specifically I digitized
   a portion of about 30 seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space
   station I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
   frames To increase the differences between frames I digitized it at only
   5 frames per second to give a total of 171 frames

   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384288 pixels with the Spigot
   card in my Centris 650 quartersize resolution from a PAL source I then
   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor
   keeping the 5 fps frame rate I created two versions of the movie one scaled
   to 320240 resolution the other at 160120 resolution I used the default
   200 quality setting in Premiere 201 and specified a key frame every ten
   frames

   I then ran the 320240 movie through the same Raw Speed Test program I used
   for the results Id been reporting earlier

   Result a playback rate of over 45 frames per second

   Thats right I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
   test movie Just for fun I copied the 320240 movie to my external hard
   disk a Quantum LP105S and ran it from there This time the playback rate
   was only about 35 frames per second Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
   also a Quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback

   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
   scaling factors and tried playing back the 160120 movie scaled to 320240
   size This time the playback speed was over 60 fps Clearly the poster who
   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 10 in
   action not 15 Id try my tests with QuickTime 10 but I dont think its
   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 71

   Unscaled the playback rate for the 160120 movie was over 100 fps

   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320240 movie with
   preferred playback rates greater than 10 and seeing how well they played
   from within MoviePlayer ie with QuickTimes normal synchronized playback
   A preferred rate of 90  45 fps didnt work too well the playback was
   very jerky Compare this with the raw speed test which achieved 45 fps with
   ease I cant believe that QuickTimes synchronization code would add this
   much overhead I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac systems task
   switching

   A preferred rate of 70  35 fps seemed to work fine I couldnt see
   any evidence of stutter At 80  40 fps I think I could see slight
   stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell

   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
   key frames to make the stutter more noticeable Of course this will also
   improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance
   even more

Im afraid I missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that
can significantly affect QuickTimes playback speed that you may want to take
into account

1 playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually 8 or 16
bit but other depths are of course possible

2 type of scaling QT is optimized for double size scaling other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder

3 playback window position MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default Im not sure about Premiere

Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance  Image size
is of course another biggie  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also
make a real difference

Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread
