Hello
I have some problem in converting tga filegenerated by POVray to
rle file When I convert I do not get any warning message But
if I use xloadimagegetx11 something is wrong

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm but I do not spend
time to install them Even I do not want to generate rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle if possiblergb to rle works but
it will mess up my directory with so many files and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file say cat  rawtorle  rleflip 
Does any body out there have same experienceproblems 


Well for starters why use rle files  

Exactly

I didnt want to mess with tga or rle  So I wrote the following script 
All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities 

This script is a pov to jpg converter  Just run it like this

  pov2jpg 1280 1024 fredpov 

You will need to modify the paths in the script to reflect where you put
povray and its include files  If you have a problem with disk space you
can use named pipes instead of temporary files

I hope you find it useful
