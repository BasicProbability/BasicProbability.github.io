RHIve noticed that if you only save a model with all your mapping planes
RHpositioned carefully to a 3DS file that when you reload it after restarting
RH3DS they are given a default position and orientation  But if you save
RHto a PRJ file their positionsorientation are preserved  Does anyone
RHknow why this information is not stored in the 3DS file  Nothing is

    This is because the PRJ Project format saves all of your settings
    right down to the last render files name

RHId like to be able to read the texture rule information does anyone have
RHthe format for the PRJ file

    Sorry Dont have anything on that or the CEL format
