Subject POV 286  Where

Sorry if this is a FAQ but 

    Where can I get a 286 16 bit version of POVRay  

Any help would be greatly appreciated

I need the 286 version since Turbo Pascal wont let me run a 32 bit
program from within my program  Any info on this would also be a
great help

                                Thanks
