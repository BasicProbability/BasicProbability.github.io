Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is
available via ftp  For those of you who dont know it is a composite
photograph of the entire earth with cloudcover removed  I just think
its really cool  It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project so I would assume its in the public domain

Thanks for any info
	Ryan
