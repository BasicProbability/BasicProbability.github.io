 Are there any TIFF to anything programs out there for the IBM
 Our scanner works into TIFF and I can view it on CSHOW 81 but 
 all of my other programs read errors  Are there any basic Tiff to 
 JPEG GIF PCX BMP etc
  Try WinJPEG on oakoaklandedupubmsdoswindows3winjp210zip
  It has more TIFF support than graphics workshop  It also converts to
  all the above formats
