RHIve noticed that if you only save a model with all your mapping planes
RHpositioned carefully to a 3DS file that when you reload it after restarting
RH3DS they are given a default position and orientation  But if you save
RHto a PRJ file their positionsorientation are preserved  Does anyone
RHknow why this information is not stored in the 3DS file  Nothing is

    This is because the PRJ Project format saves all of your settings
    right down to the last render files name

RHId like to be able to read the texture rule information does anyone have
RHthe format for the PRJ file

    Sorry Dont have anything on that or the CEL format

Well I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the PRJ file as much
as I needed to  extracted the mapping icon information  which is
when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs I need
a mapping icon per applied texture  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture
ruleplane to be specified in 3Space ie positionorientation of the
mapping rule  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply
textures to ALL objectsfaces it renders no pun intended 3DS totally
unsuitable for my needs

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a
PC  I must be able to specify texture rules one per texture and this
must be saved in a file which I can read  I havent found any info on Alias
in the copy of the faq that I have
