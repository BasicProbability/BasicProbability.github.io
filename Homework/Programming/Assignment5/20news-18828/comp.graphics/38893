 Thanks to the people who helped me with the problem of
 displaying 24 bit images All the viewers like xli
 xloadimage and display are converting the 24 bit images
 to 8 bit before display them on the screen
 
 What I really want is a viewer with make use of the 24 bit
 framescreen buffer in our case the Parallax one
 

Try ImageMagick I cannot test it but one told me it does 24bit
Anyway are you SURE your Xserver supports 24bit TrueColor visuals
