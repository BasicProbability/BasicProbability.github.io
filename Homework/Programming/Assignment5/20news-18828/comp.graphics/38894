I have not seen articles in compgraphicsresearch for a long time
Does ithe work anymore

I have seen many conference related postings in compgraphics
and it is hard to believe that people have not tried to post them to
cgresearch

If somebody has not got his article to compgraphicsresearch then
write to me or post here
