 Could someone please tell me the Best FTPable viewer available for MSDOS
 I am running a 486 33mhz with SVGA monitor
 I need to look at gifs mainly and it would be advantageous if it ran
 under windowsthanks

FTP to wuarchivewustledu
change into mirrorsmsdosgraphics
get grfwk61tzip
This is the DOS version of Graphic Workshop  There is a Windows version which
you could probably find in the mirrorsmsdoswindows3 directory but I dont 
know what the file name is
