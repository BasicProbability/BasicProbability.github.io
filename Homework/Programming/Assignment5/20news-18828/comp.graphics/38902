I use Aldus Photostyler on the PC and I can turn a colour or black and white
image into a negative or turn a negative into a colour or black and white
image  I dont know how it does it but it works well  To test it I scanned
a negative and used Aldus to create a positive  It looked better than the
print that the film developers gave me
