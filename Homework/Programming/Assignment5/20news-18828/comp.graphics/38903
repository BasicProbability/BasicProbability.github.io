Subject Interesting conversion Problem


	I have a very large 3x5 feet file in Macintosh Canvas v2something
which I need to import into AutoCad 12 in the least diskspace intensive
way possible  ie EPS is a big problem since it took 13 MEG to encode
one page of the document  The file is entirely lines and words  I have
access to networked Macs  PCs and ftp  Can anyone suggest how this might
be accomplished  Email replies if you would I dont read this group much
Thanks in advance
