Of course the Question has not yet been discovered
But the Question was later revealed to be  What is 9 x 6  In the
base 13 system of course

If you read the last couple of books in the series closely well 3 and 4
at least there are at least two points at which the real Question is
implied  Conversations proceed much like

Zaphod What is the ultimate Question I wonder
Arthur not paying much attention to Zaphod but needing a random seed for
  the Infinite Improbability Drive Think of a number any number

Actually it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well and
everytime its arranged such that Think of a number any number could be
an answer to someones question about the Question

I kind of like it  Very mystifying  Its not even pick a number or
tell me a number just think of one
