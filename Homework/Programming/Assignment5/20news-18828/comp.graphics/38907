Subject re GeoSphere Image

Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is
available via ftp  For those of you who dont know it is a composite
photograph of the entire earth with cloudcover removed  I just think
its really cool  It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project so I would assume its in the public domain

Thanks for any info
	Ryan


 I have a copy of The EarthFrom Space on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots Inc LA CA  800 2722779  As printed on the
poster the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project
The image IS copyrighted so I doubt that youll find it legally in
the public domain  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project an environmental education thing and the cost is
nominal so crack a 20 and buy one  Also I dont think its always
safe to assume that just because the government funded a project any
products will be provided for free  Many government agencies NASA NOAA
and some private groups National Geographic provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public rather than pure research
