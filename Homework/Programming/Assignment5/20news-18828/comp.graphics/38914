Does anyone know if a digitized version of the GeoSphere image is
available via ftp  For those of you who dont know it is a composite
photograph of the entire earth with cloudcover removed  I just think
its really cool  It was created with government funds and sattelites
as a research project so I would assume its in the public domain

This image is copyrighted Early in another news group it was being
used as a texture map in a planet orbiting simulation That program
was being freely distributed but the texture map picture for the 
earth had to be pulled because of copyright infringement issues
