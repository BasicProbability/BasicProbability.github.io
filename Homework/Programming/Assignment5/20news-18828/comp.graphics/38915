 Okay I got enough replies about the Kubota KenaiDenali systems that I
 will post a summary of their capabilities    
 
 GRAPHICS
 
 Transform Modules	16			16
 Frame Buffer Modules	51020			51020
 Frame Buffer		1280x1024x24bit		1280x1024x24bit
 			double buffered		double buffered
 Zbuffer		24bit			24bit
 Alphastencil		8bit			8bit
  

Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling but not both
simultaneously

 Stereo support	yes			yes
 Other			both machines will double buffer or do
                                                                 
 				stereo output per window  Both have an
 				auxiliary video output that is RS170A
 				NTSC and PAL

Same question again does this mean they can either do double
buffering or stereo but not both simultaneously
