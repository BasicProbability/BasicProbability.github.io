 Im looking for a program which is able to display 24 bits
 images We are using a Sun Sparc equipped with Parallax
 graphics board running X11
 
 Utah raster toolkit using getx11 Convert your sun raster files presumably to 
 ppm with the pbm toolkit then convert ppm to utah rle format with ppmtorle which
 is provided in the toolkit

Or just use the URT tool rastorle

 
 I seem to remember that Xloadimage can do 24 bit servers too

Yes both it and the newer xli can
