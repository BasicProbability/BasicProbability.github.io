Subject gif to wpg or tiff converter

I am looking for an available program that would convert gif
files to other formats usable on DOSbased software such
as WordPerfect Presentations which will handle wpg and tiff
among others  

Any suggestions would be appreciated  Thank you very much for
your time and help
