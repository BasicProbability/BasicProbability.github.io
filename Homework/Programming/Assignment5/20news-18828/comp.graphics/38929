Subject PC paint program NeoPaint v11Help

I am looking for a shareware graphics package called NeoPaint v11  I 
saw it in a shareware catalog and was hoping that I could FTP it from 
the net but have been unable to locate it  I have tried Archie and I 
have gone through the entire compgraphics newsgroup looking for some 
reference to it and have found none  I have  also looked through the 
FAQ and also no reference  The program is called NeoPaint v11 and if 
anyone has heard of it or knows where I can get it I would appreciate 
it

Suggestions for other PC based shareware paint programs would also be 
appreciated Email me your responses

Much thanks
Sean
