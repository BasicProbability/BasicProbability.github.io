 Does this mean they can either do alpha or stenciling but not both
 simultaneously

 Stereo support              yes                     yes
 Other                      both machines will double buffer or do
                             stereo output per window  Both have an
                             auxiliary video output that is RS170A
                             NTSC and PAL

 Same question again does this mean they can either do double
 buffering or stereo but not both simultaneously

    For both these questions its an inclusive or  Alpha plus stencil is
supported theyre separate as is doublebuffered stereo
