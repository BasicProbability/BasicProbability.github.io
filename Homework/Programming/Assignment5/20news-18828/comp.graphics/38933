                FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE

          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 2124
          in Orlando Florida  The conference was organized by the Rensse
          laer Design Research Center in cooperation with  IEEE  and  SIG
          GRAPH   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con
          tinents   A  good  crosssection  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users workstation vendors thirdparty PHIGS implementors stan
          dards  committee  members  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia  The opening speaker Dr Richard Puk challenged PHIGS
          users  to  take  charge of your PHIGS by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors    The   closing  speaker  Dr  Andries  Van  Dam
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  beyond
          PHIGS

          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
          topics  PHIGS  and  X Application Toolkits Application Issues
          Texture Mapping NURBS  PHIGS  Extensions  and  ObjectOriented
          Libraries and Frameworks  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX PHIGS
          NonRetained Data RealWorld CAD Applications Using  PHIGS  and
          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
          a good forum for exchange of ideas needs and experiences   The
          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang
          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  objectoriented  tools
          based on PHIGS

          Next years conference is planned for March 1994

          PHIGS EVERYWHERE

          At the conference PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers from PCs to
          mainframes

          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including
          conditional traversal composite logical input devices texturing
          and translucency

          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO  PRO  the  Photo
          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS  FIGARO  PRO  is designed to add
          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS API with features like
          ray   tracing  materials  antialiasing  and  texture  mapping
          Radiosity support is also planned

          FIGARO is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging
          graphics  features to their products  FIGARO supports immediate
          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL  HP  Starbase
          and SGI GLOpenGL FIGARO for NT will be released this summer

          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph a  powerful
          2call  charting  system  based on PHIGS and FIGt an object
          oriented utility library for PHIGSPEX developers

          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on
          Silicon  Graphics  workstations Scheduled for summer 1993 Ver
          sion 30 of GPHIGS the companys  PHIGS  library  for  worksta
          tions  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS
          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS
          internal  state  G5G  also  described  their NonDuplicated Data
          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS
          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory In addition G5G described
          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions
          during  GPHIGS traversal  GPHIGS and PHIGURE G5Gs data visual
          izer and application development toolkit are currently available
          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL X Windows PEX or
          Starbase

          Wise Software presented a slide show of  ZPHIGS  for  MSWindows
          and ARENA a PHIGS based modellerrender ZPHIGS implements most
          of the PHIGS primitives  In addition ZPHIGS has built in  many
          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping shadow genera
          tion area quick updates and ray tracing A demo disk of  ZPHIGS
          or ARENA is available on request

          ATC exhibited GRAFPAKPHIGS their fullfeatured PHIGS  implemen
          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS GRAFPAKPHIGS is available on most
          workstation platforms with C FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor
          porates PEX support

          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center Digital
          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V24 running on the
          DEC 3000400 AXP PXG ATCs GRAFPAKPHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS
          DEC  PHIGS  V24 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with
          support for PEX V51  protocol  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most
          GMEDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  posttoview  as  well  as
          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and
          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment

          The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340
          workstation running graPHIGS and PEX

          Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference A
          Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics
          PEX terminal HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance
          ments


          PHIGS USER GROUP

          The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS
          applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and
          PHIGS standards bodies  For more  information  about  the  PHIGS
