Subject Re NTSC data to RGB   For Video Capture



Usually you apply

R     1     0        1402   Y
G    1  034414   071414 U
B     1    1772     0       V


after unlevelshifting U and V subtracting 128 from them

This matrix multiplication may give results out of RGB space so you
have to clamp the resulting bytes to 0255
The conversion should be done with arbitrary big integers not floats 

This applies to YUV data whereas NTSC may have YIQ where a 33 degree
rotation to UV is buid in
