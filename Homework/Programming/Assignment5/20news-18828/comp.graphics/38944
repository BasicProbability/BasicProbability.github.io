Subject Kubota vs ES Freedome


More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics
workstations so here is some more info on the KenaiDenali vs the
ES Freedom


Here is the text of a Denali vs ES Freedom done by DH Brown Associates



Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its highlevel design  Both products use
a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations  Both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors  As a result Denali and Freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality  Both design teams also appear to have 
similar philosophies with respect to modularity scalability and market
penetration

There remain however several important differences between the KPC and
ES products  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a highend
developers dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility  In its favor Freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than Denali  All Freedom
systems include a large fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions  The Freedom
design treats its entire image memory as generalpurpose memory allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of specialpurpose
applications  Finally ES provided Freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications  Note
that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not
require an external video encoder  ES programmable output features
however will remain much more flexible

The KPC design team in contrast made Denali more of an endusers system
Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than lowend
Freedom configurations and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because
it uses a deeper scanconversion pipeline to support each one resulting
in better costperformance characteristics  Although both products provide
strong support for 3D imaging and volume rendering KPC recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities  Denalis
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately and to upgrade
them separately as needed

Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack SGIs more expensive
VGXT and RealityEngine systems  the only other products to provide
this capability  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy trilinear interpolated mipmapping method  On balance however Denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than ES for most applications
Aside from being much more affordable KPC solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more offscreen memory for general graphics
data storage  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules ES foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance  Kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules providing a lowercost more scalable
solution

Hope this helps
