Hi there
I am interested in facial animation and want to implement some program about this area
But I dont have any 3D information for the face
I am looking for some 3D images of face

Try getting the Cyberwaredemo via ftp which contains 3D images of the
face


What is the copyright status of this data  Are there restrictions regarding the
uses they can be put to
