Subject Re Why does Illustrator AutoTrace so poorly


I use Arts  Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences
it traces beautifully BUT  theres a trick to tracing Ive traced entire
cartoon images into custom clip art but you cant expect to just point to
the image and get it just like that it takes a little work in some cases
a lot of work You need to trace a drawing piece by piece and then put it 
together its kinda hard to explain in type but if youre ever in Reno
I can give you a little demonstration
