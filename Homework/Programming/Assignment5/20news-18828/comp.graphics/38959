Subject Re Turning photographic images into thermal print andor negatives

In article 1993Apr2816234314513sequncwiledu hawkssequncwiledu David Hawks writes

It is for a business and the end product has to be a photograph
I take damaged black and whites usually old some very and repair them
by hand at present  I would like to do this by using a computer
I am just trying to find a vendor who can convert my computer stored
images to negatives or thermal print  The customer will want hisher
copy as much as possible like a brand new original photgraph

There are several CRTtofilm writers around Agfa has some they also might
be called Matrix and I am pretty sure other companies sell the same
equipment You might want to talk to any company in your area that does
presentation slides or offers graphics services They should have those
machines and they might point you to a local vendor From there on its all
a question of money They units are essentially high res CRTs plus a filter
wheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hookup
