	Hello
	can anybody help me to find a program that converts a format named
	raw also known as img to the gif format or jpeg one
	Its desirable to be for a unix machine than for a PC

	
	Raw format of a NN image is a file that contain a tail of 
	NN characters each one referencing to the kNj pixel of the 
	monocrome image where k and j lies between 0 and N1
