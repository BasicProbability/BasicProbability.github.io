Subject IBM Writing to screen memory graphics

Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information not
books Im too poor regarding programming the standard graphics modes
320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough but Im not so sure about the
rest  Something about planes or something and writing to ports and the
like but I dont know the numbers or anything  for the 16 color modes I
think  If Im wrong let me know  Also 320x200x256 is just one bytepixel
thats easy enough but are there any other ways to write to the screen
perhaps bytes at a time or something like that

Of course Id appreciate any information about any mode  which reminds
me of another question  do the SuperVGA modes work the same generally
as the normal 16 and 256 color modes or is not only the mode numbers
for various cards different but the methods for writing to the screen
different as well

Thanks for any help you can give me  Im developing a screen class for
C and find myself searching for information  Oh I do have Ralf Browns
Interrupt List which has given me tons of invaluable information already
It just doesnt go into the screen programming details except for the
readwrite pixel BIOS calls

Thanks again
