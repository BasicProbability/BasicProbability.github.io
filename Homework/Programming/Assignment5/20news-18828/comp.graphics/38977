Subject Intels PCI standard

       I read a mesg somewhere on GENIE about Intel coming out with a 
graphics standard called PCI which would supplant VESA standards  Is
this a rumor or is there some substance to it If any of yall have
heard of this standard please email me on how I might obtain more info

Thanks in Advance
