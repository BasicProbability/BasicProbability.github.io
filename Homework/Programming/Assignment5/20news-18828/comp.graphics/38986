 Hi

 Im looking for a program which is able to display 24 bits
 images We are using a Sun Sparc equipped with Parallax
 graphics board running X11

    xli xloadimage or ImageMagick  exportlcsmitedu 1824012 contrib


xv 30 shareware supports 24bit displays and has lots of other
improvements over earlier versions  Definitely worth checking out
