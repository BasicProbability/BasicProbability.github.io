 Earlier today I read an ad for REAL3D animation  raytracing software
 and it looked very convincing to me

Yes it looks like very good indeed

 However I dont own an Amiga and so I began to wonder if theres a PC
 version of it

Nope


	Did I not hear that there maybe some ports of Real3D Version2
   	in the pipeline somewhere Possibly Unix Not too sure though
        please put me straight
