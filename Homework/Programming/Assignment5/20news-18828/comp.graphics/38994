Subject Re POVRay for VAX computer



Get the generic version for Unix and VMS and build it IMHO a
VMS com file to build it is supplied
As the distribution comes as tarZ you should either have uncompress
and tar on VMS or a UNIX flavoured machine handy
Usually you wont find this on IBMPC specific archives but on the better
ones
