Does anyone on this group use this program It stacks up pretty well to
Corel Draw and since I dont have a CDROM it was the best buy

Maybe someone would be interested in trading tips and tricks

Yes I have both Arts  Letters and CorelDraw  I personally like
Arts  Letters better but there are things I like about Arts  Letters
that CorelDraw doesnt do an viceversa  I havent found the perfect
graphics program that does everything yet  

My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different
formats  Arts  Letters does not  I like the thousands of clipart
available with Arts  Letters  However I do find looking them up
in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying

One of my major problems is that there isnt any programs available on
the market for the artistically deprived
