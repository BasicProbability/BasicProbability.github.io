Subject Software Development Libs for Old TARGA16 Boards

I am revamping some computeraided visual inspection systems which
use the old ATT Targa16 Board Set 2 cards to display images from
a color CCD camera to a color monitor providing the option to overlay
text or a crosshair No image capture or manipulation is performed 
just display I would like to know if there is still a source for 
development libraries which would allow me to embed commands in my
own software to enable the camera draw crosshairs print text etc
Ill be glad to pay if they are commercially available EMail if
possible
