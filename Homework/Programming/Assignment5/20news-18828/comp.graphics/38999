 But surely you dont expect a system you buy now for a five year
 period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period

	Whats sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much
it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendors
hardware  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors  Apple
DEC and SGI  and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendors
hardware  Currently it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about
dropping support for the Personal Iris DEC customers are pissed at DEC for
dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes and Apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced thats faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought  When I used to be a Sun customer
years ago I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386
and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along

	Whats really interesting is that from what I can tell the MIS
folks in the basement with their ES9000 dont seem to be pissed at IBM
Why  I have no idea  Either IBM really does take care of their customers
better or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the
smaller vendors do
