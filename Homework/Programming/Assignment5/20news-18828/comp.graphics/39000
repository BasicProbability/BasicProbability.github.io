Subject LCD VGA display

Please help

I have an IBMcompatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen  While I
was working with it this morning the screen started to flicker a little
which I thought was odd since I do use a surgeprotector for my computer and
all peripherals  It only did this for a second and then stopped

I left the room for several minutes and when I returned the screen was
completely dim not blank but very very dim  The contrast slider still
worked so that I could adjust it to where I could faintly make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect

I was pluggedin at the time ie not using the battery but I still
tried switching the battery changing the powersaver features etc etc
all to no avail

Has anyone else experienced anything like this  If this just means that I
need to replace the screen then I guess Ill have to but I thought that the
death of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened  I didnt want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
net about this because I already know what theyll say Yep you gotta have
this replaced and its gonna cost you 

Ive only had the computer for about 21 months  Is that a reasonable life
cycle for a LCD display  Oh I guess I ought to give specifics here the
brand is Compudyne Is this a reputable company its a 386SX  20 MHz
I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today

If anyone can help me PLEASE give me any advice you might have  Im not
opposed to having it replaced but Id rather not if its not absolutely
necessary  If you wouldnt mind please email me at mikemikukyedu
but if youd rather post Ill be checking back here in a couple of days

BTW if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere feel
free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and
name of the FAQ if you dont mind

Thanks in advance for any help
