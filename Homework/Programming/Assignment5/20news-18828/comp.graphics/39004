Subject Drivers for Diamond Viper Card

Ive been away for a couple of weeks and have become out of touch with the 
latest information on the Diamond Viper Card  Does anyone know if Diamond 
has come out with any Vesa Driver updates lately  Also I was wondering 
what the latest Windows Driver version is up to now

				Thanks in advance
