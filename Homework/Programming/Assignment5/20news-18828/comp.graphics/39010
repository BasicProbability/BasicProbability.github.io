    re a true 24 bit XV

 If you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of
 precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them

Dont mind if I do
As someone who would love to see XV go to 24 bit this
would be plenty for me

    a XV can Load a 24 bit image and display it in all its
24 bit glory on 24 bit X displays
    b All other operations Crop Dither Smooth etc are not
supported on 24 bit images

how hard would this be
