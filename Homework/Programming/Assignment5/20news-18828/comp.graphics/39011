 Im using rayshade on the uw computers here and id like input
 from other users and perhaps swap some ideas  I could post
 uuencoded gifs here or ray code if anyones interested  Im having
 trouble coming up with colors that are metallic ie brass steel
 from the RGB values

Sorry Im not a rayshade user  but hey it looks like this group could
use some traffic  My guess is that metallic isnt a color in the RGB
sense  Rather its a matter of how the surface reflects light  Im not
sure what property metallic materials have that makes them recognizable
as such but Im pretty sure any color material can look metallic
