I am interested in finding 3D animation programs for the Mac
I am especially interested in any programs that dont exist
in a PC port and are so good that they would make me go buy
a Mac  Do any such exist

Thanks in advance

Howdy  I think you would be interested in InfiniD 25 for the Mac  There
is no DOS or Windows version  Its quite an amazing program

Some of the features

  Bevel Text
  Timeline based animation sequencer
  Realtime bounding box preview
  Object linking
  Phong Shading
  Ray Tracing
  Bounding Box shading
  Wireframe shading
  Ghourad shading
  Flat shading
  Antialiasing none low medium high
  Environment maps
  Quicktime support wrap a QT movie around an object
  Procedural surfaces
  Composed surfaces for layering surfaces
  Alpha channel support
  Import EPS DXF and Swivel 3D files
  Export DXF and Swivel 3D files
  Spline based animation
  Animation assistant for creating smooth movements and other stuff
  Object morphing surfaces and bevels morph too

 And lots more that I cant remember right now

Anyway its not as expensive as some of the other animationrendering
packages  I think you can get it for around 699 from MacWarehouse
They also have educational discounts

Well hope that helps a bit

See ya
