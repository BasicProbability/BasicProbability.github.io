Subject Company info for graphics software

Within the next several months Ill be looking for a job in computer
graphics software  Im in need of info on graphics software companies 
Ive checked the FAQ the resource list and siggraphorg havent found
anything  The last Computer Graphics Career Handbook that Im aware of
was published in 1991  It has a list of 40 companies in it but no
tremendously specific information on any of them

Can people please steer me towards more current and indepth informational
resources  Thanks  Ill post a summary if theres interest
