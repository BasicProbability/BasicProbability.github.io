Subject Universal VESA Driver

        Some time ago about 1 month there was a bit of discussion
        about a universal VESA driver for  8bit cards  It was in
        the file uvesa32zip  Well i cant find it does anyone know
        where it is gorillasomethingsomethingau and what sort
        of cards it works for 

        Also would it be pushing my luck to ask for someone to post
        it to some appropriate group
