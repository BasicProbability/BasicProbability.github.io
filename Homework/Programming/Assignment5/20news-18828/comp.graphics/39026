Subject Re REAL3D

I heard a friend who just return from NAB from Las Vegas confirm
that RealSoft will be releasing a Windows version of REAL3D 20
this summer  He was told that the rendering speed on the DX50 isnt
as fast as A4000  However he was also told that they are switching
from Microsoft C to Watcom to gain more speed  For people who is
looking for a powerful 3D animation software for PC  The wait
shouldnt be too long  Real 3D 20 is absolutely the most powerful and
flexible 3D package out there that sells for less than 1000

ps I heard a Indigo version is also under development
