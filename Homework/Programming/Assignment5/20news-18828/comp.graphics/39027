Subject Source to create FLI or FLC 


Does anyone know if the source is available to create FLI
or FLC animations I would ideally like DLLs for Windows
but would settle for C source  Ive heard they might be 
available on Amiga forums somewhere  The libraries
currently distributed by Autodesk AAWIN AAPLAY do NOT
have FLI creation capability only playback

Any pointers would be appreciated thanks
