Subject VIDEO SPEED

I am using an ibm dx50 with EISA and local busand I need to get a
local bus video card

The only hitch is that I need one that will allow me to do the fastest
anims or flics from ram I have 64megs of ram in 16meg simms

I am using 3DStudio from Autodesk and Imagine from Impulse
They both write out in the FLC format

So does anyone know what would be the best card for showing fast anims
from ram ie like the orchid Diamond Stealth Viper ATIetc

any help would be appreciated  I am trying to circumvent the single
frame route

email me at trb3ramsstateedu
or just post back up herethanks
