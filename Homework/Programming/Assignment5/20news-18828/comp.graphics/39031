Subject Fractal terrain generator

	Does anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for Mac something
	I could hopefully import into a 3D program like Swivel or Stratavision
	I know InfiniD has built in capabilities but I dont have access to
	InfiniD I downloaded two programs from Umich in graphicsfractals
	but both were from 199091 and crashed under System 7 I think they
	were Black and white anyway Please email me if you know of anything
	as I dont check the newsgroups very often
		Thanks in advance
