 Has anyone else experienced anything like this  If this just means that I
 need to replace the screen then I guess Ill have to but I thought that the
 death of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
 happened  I didnt want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
 net about this because I already know what theyll say Yep you gotta have
 this replaced and its gonna cost you 

 Ive only had the computer for about 21 months

Only  Thats a long time echoing above posting  The way the market
is going nowadays your machines obsolete two weeks before you buy it 
Sounds like youll have to sink some money into it for repair but
thats sometimes necessary for equipment

 Is that a reasonable life
 cycle for a LCD display

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong but thats a moot
point perhaps
