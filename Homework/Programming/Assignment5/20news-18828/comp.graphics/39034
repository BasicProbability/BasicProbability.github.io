 Ive only had the computer for about 21 months  Is that a reasonable life
 cycle for a LCD display

My Toshiba T1100 LCD CGA 1986 died in 11 months  Replaced under the 12
month warranty fortunately  When it died it died instantly and completely

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600s in a short space of time They were all around 2 years old
Some screens went completely as above others were just dodgy

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of maybe 100 They were fairly reliable up
to then and I dont think it was a special problem with Toshs no link to the
company So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable  just
unlucky
