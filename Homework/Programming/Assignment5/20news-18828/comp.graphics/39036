  I put it to you thus  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone  If it still exists
where  And if it DOES exist why are those who call themselves hackers
allowing this to perpetuate itself  Why are they not creating new innovative
interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry

How about the GNU people handing out very good free software  Ive also
distributed two decentsized programs myself the Go player Fumiko at
ftpuwashingtonedu and the Genetic Neural Network Programmer CEREBRUM
somewhere out there

Ive only had time to write these programs because of scholarships and
grants  The intended benefit to society or a loophole in the system
