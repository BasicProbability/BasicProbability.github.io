Subject Re Adobe Photo Shop type software for UnixXMotif platforms


In article C5w8xBIv6worldstdcom sciimageprocessingcompgraphics wdmworldstdcom Wayne Michael writes
    I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and
    manipulation package for UnixXMotif platforms that is comparable
    to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac stuff deleted

I understand that Adobe is working on making Photoshop available for
the SGI Indigo but that is just rumor and I wouldnt bet on it
until I see it But they are going to release Illustrator for the SGI
real soon now
