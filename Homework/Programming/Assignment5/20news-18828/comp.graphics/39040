XV allows this feature but I dont recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images

Ah now we see thew problem First you want to extend xv to allow
editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images Then I point out problems
with this Now you are saying there is no problem because you
personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause
the problem
 see previous article on this debate for the rests 

I can see XV300 agree with my view in cases you dont  even I say
my personal opinion as above it doesnt mean that it is not most
obvious thing
Please if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument
please do read them  you have not saw them at all you just
refered to text from which I wrote something  and you make
hard decisions from that without reading what exactly I have written

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and dont understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning You seem to be one such

You also start replying to my articles even you dont understand what
is going on you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV 221 even I posted them within the article you did reply
to Believe me it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place

XV300 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didnt Im sure you just didnt undertand what about I
wrote We can blame my writing skills in English for that or

Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV300 gives
I allready mailed one to Bradley
