	Does anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for Mac something
	I could hopefully import into a 3D program like Swivel or Stratavision
	I know InfiniD has built in capabilities but I dont have access to
	InfiniD I downloaded two programs from Umich in graphicsfractals
	but both were from 199091 and crashed under System 7 I think they
	were Black and white anyway Please email me if you know of anything
	as I dont check the newsgroups very often
		Thanks in advance

Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain
surfaces for exactly the purpose you require importing into 3D
modelling packages Be warned the data content is high and brings
many packages to their knees We use it primarily for MicroStation
but it exports DXF as well as other formats so you should be OK
You can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US
It is
   wuarchivewustledu
my stuff is located in the
   mirrorsarchitec
directory Please FTP the README file first
