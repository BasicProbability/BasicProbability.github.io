    I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and
    manipulation package for UnixXMotif platforms that is comparable
    to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac stuff deleted

I understand that Adobe is working on making Photoshop available for
the SGI Indigo but that is just rumor and I wouldnt bet on it
until I see it But they are going to release Illustrator for the SGI
real soon now

I was at an Adobe seminarconferencepropaganda forumwhateveryouwantto
callit a couple months ago where they announced that Display Postscript was
going to be included in the next release of Suns OS presumably Solaris
Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint and in return for this
Adobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun  Other than the
articles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after I havent
heard a peep about it  I hope its still in the works
