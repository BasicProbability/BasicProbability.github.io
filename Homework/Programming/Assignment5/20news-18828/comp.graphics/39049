Subject Re Looking for polygon convexifier

Does anyone know where I can find a code which would take concave
polygons and break them up into a set of convex polygons
O

I also would like code or algorithms to do this

In fact I am interested in sources for code andor algorithms that
convert 2D graphical objects into other 2D graphical objects that
will render into the same image ie Bezier curves to B splines
or splines to circular arc segments or B splines to polgons etc
