Subject Re Easy to translate JPEG code

In article 1rfsqbINNc2pshelleyuwashingtonedu stusofthardyuwashingtonedu Stuart Denman writes

Does anyone out there have any JPEG decompression code in pretty much any
language that I can read and understand  I have trouble understanding the
JPEG Groups code that I got from an FTP site  If any one can send me
some good code I will appreciate it a lot  Thanks

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated  The IJGs code is
pretty good if you ask me and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision

Try getting a good book on the subject that will explain the algorithms

Specifically JPEG Still Image Compression Standard by Pennebaker  Mitchell
VNR 1993 ISBN 0442012721

BTW I presume your comment about good code wasnt meant to sound as offensive
as it does
