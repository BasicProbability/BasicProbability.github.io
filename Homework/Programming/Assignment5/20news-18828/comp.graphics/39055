Subject jpeg fif specification



I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF JFIF file
format I was looking thru it but I didnt get the idea how
to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image

How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF

How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture

I wrote a small tool lsgif for GIF that returns the
filesize picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks The output looks like this

  157605  blagif                                  640x 480  248C24

I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a
similar tool for JFIF with an output like this

   57605  blajpg                                  640x 480     C24

Please respond by email because I dont read this news
group very often Ill post a summary if it is useful

Thanx in advance
