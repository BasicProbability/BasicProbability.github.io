This is a heavily editedmodified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to
give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a
client and jump into Gopherspace  a complete version can be obtained
as described below  Once you have a gopher client point it at 
merlotwelchjhuedu and welcome to gopherspace

Q0  What is Gopher

A0  The Internet Gopher clientserver provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a worldcampuswide
     information system CWIS can readily be constructed   While
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information  Gopher
     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers
     throughout the world 


Q1  Where can I get Gopher software

A1  via anonymous ftp to boomboxmicroumnedu  Look in the directory
     pubgopher


Q2  What do I need to access Gopher

A2  You will need a gopher client program that runs on your local PC
     or workstation

     There are clients for the following systems  The directory
     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
     ftp site boomboxmicroumnedu 134841322 in the directory

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         jobacsohiostateeduXGOPHERCLIENTSHARE


      Note these Macintosh clients require MacTCP

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself  Put the following on a gopher server

       Type1
       Hostboomboxmicroumnedu
       Port70
       Path
       NameGopher Software Distribution

 
     Or point your gopher client at boomboxmicroumnedu port 70 and
     look in the gopher directory


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     consultantmicroumnedu 134841324 See Q3 for more
     information about this  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine mouse
     scroll bars etc  A local client is also faster


Q3  Where are there publicly available logins ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher for Gopher

A3  Here is a short list use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag

     Telnet Public Logins

     Hostname                  IP              Login   Area

     gannccgojp             160190101     gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine mouse scroll bars etc
     and gives faster response  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients  saving a file to your hard drive printing a file
     to a local printer viewing images retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc are not available by the telnet logins




Q4  Who Develops Gopher Software

A4  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer Workstation Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions  

     It has since grown into a fullfledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world

     Many people have contributed to the project too numerous to
     count 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via email at gopherboomboxmicroumnedu or via paper mail
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
      100 Union St SE 190
      Minneapolis MN 55455  USA

     Or via FAX at

Q5 What is the relationship between Gopher and WAIS WWW ftp

A5 Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to 
     
        Search local WAIS indices
        Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients
        Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients
        Be queried by WWW World Wide Web clients either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying


Q6 Are papers or articles describing Gopher available

A6 Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in

Q7 What is veronica

A7 veronica  Very Easy RodentOriented Netwide Index to 
     Computerized Archives

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopherserver menu titles
     in the entire gopher web  As archie is to ftp archives veronica 
     is to gopherspace  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client it is easy
     to use and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol

     To try veronica select it from the Other Gophers menu on 
     Minnesotas gopher server or point your gopher at
