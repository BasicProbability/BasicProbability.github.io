 Ive only had the computer for about 21 months

Only  Thats a long time

 Is that a reasonable life
 cycle for a LCD display

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable  If
you had bought a Compaq or Toshiba you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong but thats a moot
point perhaps

Maybe Ive had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine The only problem it
has and ever has had is the arm of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it
round a bit But other than that its been perfect So whats that
about um 60 months
