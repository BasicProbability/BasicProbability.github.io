How can I find these files and graphics that people
are downloading from their Unix systems Then how
do I download them I am a complete beginner in
this obviously so please babystep me through
the process First of all I dont see amongst
these newsgroups where there is anything remotely
like a GIF TIF or compiled shareware program

that will allow me to do this but first I
need to know where to go to find the file
