 Hi  sorry if this is a FAQ but are there any conversion utilities
 available for Autodesk DXF to Amiga IFF format  I
 checked the compgraphics FAQ and a number of sites but so far
 no banana  Please email
 

	DXF can not be changed over to IFF format what it can be changed
to is an object format used by one of the 3D programs on the Amiga The
only tools around are comercial for that conversion
