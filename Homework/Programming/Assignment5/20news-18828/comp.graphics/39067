 Hi  sorry if this is a FAQ but are there any conversion utilities
 available for Autodesk DXF to Amiga IFF format  I
 checked the compgraphics FAQ and a number of sites but so far
 no banana  Please email
 

       DXF can not be changed over to IFF format what it can be changed
to is an object format used by one of the 3D programs on the Amiga The
only tools around are comercial for that conversion

Hijaak claims to convert dxf to iff although Hijaak claims some stuff
that I have never gotten to work for example not long ago I tried to
convert some iff files from an Amiga video toaster using CrossDos so my
PC could read the disks int Targa files  Hijaak made some gorgeous 15
megabyte Targa files from the iffs  all totally black
