	DXF can not be changed over to IFF format what it can be changed
to is an object format used by one of the 3D programs on the Amiga The
only tools around are comercial for that conversion

Actually IFF is a format standard  It is not a picture file format sound
file format but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM or just ILBM
The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD which is used by Imagine and
its predecessor Turbo Silver   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another IFF spec but I dont know of any  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORMs I believe
