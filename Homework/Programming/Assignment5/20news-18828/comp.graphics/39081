     I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and
     manipulation package for UnixXMotif platforms that is comparable
     to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac stuff deleted
 
 I understand that Adobe is working on making Photoshop available for
 the SGI Indigo but that is just rumor and I wouldnt bet on it
 until I see it But they are going to release Illustrator for the SGI
 real soon now
 

Illustrator for SGI is a shipping product Adobe and SGI have announced that  
Photoshop is being ported to SGI machines A simillar announcement has been  
made by Adobe and Sun for Sun platforms No dates have been announced to the  
best of my knowledge
