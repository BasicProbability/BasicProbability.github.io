WHAT IS ACCESSbus

ACCESSbus is a new open industry standard for computer 
peripheral connectivity  ACCESSbus is a serial protocol that 
uses simple lowcost I2C technology to link multiple devices to 
a single PC port  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
keypads locators Mice Trackballs Joysticks printers VR 
gloves digitizers sensors actuators or data transmitters and 
others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC  Applications 
such as CADCAM Data Acquisition Simulation Virtual Reality 
MultiplePlayerSingle PC Games Education and many many more 
can now take advantage of ACCESSbus the technology that puts 
Plug and Play on every PC

The ACCESSbus offers advantages to endusers and developers of 
systems and peripherals  Multiple devices connect to the host 
computer with only one port  Common communication methods for a 
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
development  As an open standard ACCESSbus enables cross
platform use of the same device

ACCESSbus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION


ACCESSbus technology is an open specification enabling anyone 
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
fee or royalty
ACCESSbus has a bus topology architecture  That is a single 
host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices  ACCESSbus 
data rate is 100 Kbitssec

ACCESSbus Physical Layer

ACCESSbus is a serial bus architecture based on I2C hardware 
protocol with one data line and one clock line
Standard lowcost I2C microcontrollers handle bitlevel 
handshaking including automatic arbitration and clock 
synchronization  

ACCESSbus Software Protocols

The ACCESSbus communication protocol is composed of three 
levels I2C Protocol Base Protocol and Application Protocol

I2C PROTOCOL This simple and efficient protocol defines 
arbitration among contending masters without losing data  I2C 
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
different clock rates  Bus transactions include addressing 
framing of bits into bytes and byte acknowledgment by the 
receiver  

BASE PROTOCOL Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
a host computer and multiple peripherals  The host becomes the 
ACCESSbus manager  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 
ACCESSbus message envelope which is an I2C bus transaction with 
additional semantics including checksum
Unique features of the Base Protocol are autoaddressing and hot 
plugging  Autoaddressing assigns devices with unique bus 
addresses without the need for setting jumpers or switches  Hot 
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
system is running without rebooting

APPLICATION PROTOCOL This is the highest level of the ACCESSbus 
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
types of devices  Each type requires a different Application 
Protocol  Three broad device types have been identified 
keyboards locators and text devices

ACCESSbus support on the PC

All three levels of the ACCESSbus protocol are supported on the 
PC  An addon card implements the physical layer and uses the 
base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESSbus devices  
An ACCESSbus Manager  TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 31 
 controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 
the ACCESSbus device drivers  Drivers are available for 
multiple ACCESSbus keyboards locators and printers for DOS and 
Windows 31  Also available are C language source code examples 
of the interface from applications to the device drivers
