Hi Everyone 

I was woundering if someone could answer a simple
query for me on RayTracing and antialiasing 

stuff deleted

I have a similiar question relating to antialaising that my friend has asked
to have posted to the more knowledgable in this group Im sorry if this is
an FAQ

   What antialaising methods do Persistance Of Vision  Polyray use

Thank you in advance You can either email me or reply or flame me if it is
an FAQ
