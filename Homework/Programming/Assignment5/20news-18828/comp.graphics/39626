Hi

Id like to know if there is any system CPU  HD array  framebuffer
which can play and record HDTV quality moving picture in realtime

HDTV has about 6MBframe so recordingplaying moving picture will need
about 180MBsec bandwidth Im thinking to treat the raw data not
compressed 

Finding a disk array that can do 180MBsec will be difficult The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy IBM also sells these They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MBsec 64 bit For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections Their latest model the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MBsec but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster They are also not
idle must be working on newer products that might be faster and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces They
still marketed the older faster model as of a few mongths ago

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times  sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate

Interesting problem Tell us more if you can

If anyone can advise me what kind of product I should look into please
email me I will appriciate it The vendors email address price of
the products actual performance data of the products any info will 
help me

Thanks in advance
