Im having a slight problem with the POV raytracer  Im not sure if
this is the correct group to post to or not  I create tga files on
a unix machine using pov  Then when i download them to display on my pc
theyre listed as bad files  But when I create the file on my pc it displays
fine  Are unix tgas incompatible with the pc  An easy solution to this
problem would be a unix targagif converter  Anyone know where I could
find one  Any help on this subject is appreciated  

 Kevin
