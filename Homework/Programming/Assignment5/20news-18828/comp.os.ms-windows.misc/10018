Recently Windows has starting giving me the error Sound Blaster Pro
Requires newer version of Windows 31  It has worked correctly for a long
time and dont know what the problem could be  Thanks


I had this problem when I initially installed my sound blaster pro and heres
what the tech support told me

They told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from
the win31 subdirectory of the soudblaster directory Now look in the systemini
file and if any of them say devicexxxxxxx386 than change it to 
devicexxxxxxx
Thats should work Was your systemini file erased for some reason That would
be the only reason that I would think that Windoes is giving you the error now
