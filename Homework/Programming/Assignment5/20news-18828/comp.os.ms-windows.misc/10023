Subject Why Im not using Dos 6 anymore

Ive been running Dos 6 for about a month  I was generally impressed with
the improvements  the multiple boot configurations were great the
new commands were nice and DoubleSpace worked fine twice as slow for
large data transfers twice as fast for small with SmartDrv

Until now

This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper I had to
reboot a hung Dos program that did no disk io from within Windows 31
When my machine finished rebooting I found my windows directory and about two
thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted

I cannot afford problems like this  Im returning to Dos 5

PS  Ive also noticed bad sector errors from DoubleSpace where none should
      exist
