Subject Re Video cards with BNC connectors

Hello

I just recently bought a NEC 6FG  In order to get the highest possible quality
and refresh rates Id like to know if there are any accelerator cards with
BNC connectors as opposed to the usual dsub connector 

I do not know of any VGA type cards that have BNC outputs but EXTRON
sells a VGA to BNC cable set that works good with my 5FG  If you are
trying to optimize the display with a good video card try contacting 9
 1800getnine  I use and like the level 9 card

Thanks for any information
