 What exactly does the windows bitmap format look like I mean how is
 the data stored width height no of colours bitmap data I couldnt
 find anything in ths user manual is there any other reference material
 which would give me this information

 Well this is only a guess  If it goes by the true meaning of bit
 map then it holds xyc where x pixel number in th exdirection y
 pixelnumber in the ydir c colour

Come on fellows The format is quite plainly explained in the manuals
Its in the Programmers Reference Volume 3 Messages Structures
and Macros MSCDevkit for 31 should be also in the Borlands
manuals pages 232241 depending what you need

First there is the BITMAPFILEHEADERstruct then the BITMAPINFO which
contains the BITMAPINFOHEADER and the RGBQUAD and then the bitmap
data AND there is also a example among the example files MSSDK
Hope this helps


      Yes I do have some prior knowledge in this
      There is nothing dangerous in these dragons
                       they are totally harmless But my opinion
                   is that kicking them might not be the right
               way to test it So shut up and RUN

If its possible that there are some opinions above they must be all MINE
