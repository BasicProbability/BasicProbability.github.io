 Hello
 
 	Who can tell me   Where can I find the PD or ShareWare   
 Which can CAPTURE windows 31s output of printer mananger
 
 	I want to capture the output of HP Laser Jet III
 
 	Though the PostScript can setup to print to filebut HP cant
 
 	I try DOSs redirect programbut they cant work in Windows 31
 
 		Thankx for any help
 

You CAN print to a file from an HP or any other printer  Just go into
the Printers section of your Control Panel  Select the printer you want
to redirect to a file and click on Connect  Then choose FILE as the
port to connect the printer to

When you print from any application to that printer Windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout

Its pretty easy

Good luck
