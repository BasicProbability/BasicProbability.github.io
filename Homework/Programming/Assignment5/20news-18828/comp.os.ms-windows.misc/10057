    What is the procedure used to specially compress the BMP file  I would
                                          to a rle file   
love to use some of my BMP files I have created as a logo screen  Thanks

Chris

 I thought Id reply to this though I aint brad  AT any case a lot
of picturefile viewers that will convert say between gifetc to
bmp will convert to rle  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
shareware from cica desktop I think filename psVVVzip I think
where VVV is the ver number  If thats not true let me know and Ill
post a corection


This however will write your rle file with a bmp extension so you
have to rename it

NOW another thing
this is from the windows FAQ

your file has to be less than 64 K
 at least thats what the faq says but Mine wont work for more than
about 30maybe they mend 32K I dont know

Your file has to fit VGA size 480  860 or whatever standard vga size
is  If you use a nonvga screen eg Cga ega svga there is also a
way to do it but I thing instead of vgalogolgo you use another file
such as cgalogolgo egalogolgo or something  Im not sure about
this as I have a vga but im sure you could find it in the faq a
windows help ver of which is available at cica but dont konw the
filename 

ALSOyour bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less

These specs rule out some of the good bmps  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory

Finally REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WINCOM before and put your
new wincom in the windows directory  Also dont start windows from a
directory where another wincom is present as that is used instead of
the one in the windows dir and win wont start


Share this fairly but dont take a slice of my pie PF
