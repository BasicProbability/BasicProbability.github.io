We are using pkzip V204 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these
Which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst
the rest

Well I got  WINZIP from cica dont know which version but I think
its the latest as this is not long ago and I was initially imressed
But heres the lowdown

WINZIP is a great progra as long as you only unzip  It lets you
vew files unzip only selected files and even puts the files in a
checkout directory and creates a checkout grp and group if you want
to check the program out  It even prompts for deletion of these on
exit if you didnt like the program

HOWEVER big however over here  I have problems zipping  I dont
konw specifics on this or ammount of consistency but sometimes when I
zip a few files or add a file to a zip dos will violate something
or other and Ill be asked in a kind microoft kind of way to quit
all applications quit windows and restart my computer  I dont know
as I said how consistent this is as I jdont zip much and when I do
now I just go to dos and use it from there or just use the run cmd
but I do know its happened when I added files to an existing zip
file and when I created a new zip file using selected files only
I dont know if its happened when I zip an entire dir

Still it has a rather nice interface and quite useful unziping
functions  If the above is fixed Ill be the first to register the new
ver  as for now a good old rununzip zip will work

PS if a new ver is out that fixes these please let me know

peace
