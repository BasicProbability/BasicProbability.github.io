    What is the procedure used to specially compress the BMP file  I would
love to use some of my BMP files I have created as a logo screen  Thanks

I dont know the specifics of the compression algorithm but Ive used the
shareware program PaintShop to convert between the two  You can download
it from ftpcicaindianaedu but I dont know what the file is called
or what directory it is in you can start by looking in pubpcwin3 or try
scanning the index files

To convert a BMP file to a RLE file you just load the BMP file and do a
Save as  Select Windows bitmap and Compressed or is it RLE
Whatever it is its fairly intuitive

Sorry I dont have all the details but Im currently on an IBM3151 dumb
terminal and cant do much researchingGood luck
