We are using pkzip V204 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these
Which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst
the rest
Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS 
PKZIPPKUNZIP commands

Do you mean a prog that doesnt jump to the DOS display and then back or 
create a temp DOS window

If yes then I might recommend WinZip from ftpcicaindianaedu  Im afraid 
I dont have the file name or version but you should be able to find it

Its fully compatible with ver 204g and very functional
