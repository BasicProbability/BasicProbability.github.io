    Hi
      Ive been using Plannet Crafters Plugin for Program Manager
      Its listed in most BBSes as PLUGIN13  Its an addon which gives
      some needed features to Progman such as the ability to better
      manage your groups change your cursor and icons on the fly
      constant status of RAM and resources Quickmenu a dropdown
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher plus some other neat stuff
      Used it liked it and even regd it G

      If you cant find it anywhere let me know and Ill zip it up and
      mail it to you shareware version of course g

Aloha
