Subject Re Why Im not using Dos 6 anymore

Regarding the horror stories about DOS6DOUBLEDISK and STACKER 2
killing hard drives

I was wondering if the dos 6 MIRROR command works on the doubled
drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table
If it records the vital DoubleDisk info then using it daily
should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
type of catastrophic failure discussed  If it doesnt then
shame on Microsoft
