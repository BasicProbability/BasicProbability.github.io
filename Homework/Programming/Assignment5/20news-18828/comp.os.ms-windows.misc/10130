Can anyone tell me where to find a standard VESA display driver that will 
support the onthemotherboard XGA video of a 486 50Mz DX2 IBM Model 95
85950LF  I need to use 640 x 480 and higher resolutions under both 
Windows 31 and MSDOS  Minimum colors 256 at highest resolution with 64K 
colors needed at 640 x 480

The IBM XGA SVGA VESA driver is on the 202 reference diskette available
from the IBM BBS  Its also on Compuerve or you can bang on your sales
rep to get you a later version
