 Hello
 
 	Who can tell me   Where can I find the PD or ShareWare   
 Which can CAPTURE windows 31s output of printer mananger

If you are planning on using this on a regular basis conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because Windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create Ive found that putting a line in systemini in the
ports section with just a path and filename works The only problem is that
if you send more than one job the second one deletes the first
