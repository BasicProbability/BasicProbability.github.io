Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft supporters

  has MS innovated ANYTHING 
 
  Really when you come down to it who cares I just hope MS keeps doing
  what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses

Lets see what MS products dont have major bugs in them  Oh but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up even if their
customers must buy new releases from them that are little more than
bug fixes  Anyone who buys a 2500 computer system and then runs MS
Windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy  

Oh wait MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mousedidnt
they  Logitech Inside

 Personally Ill be blasphemous and say that if Microsoft keeps doing
 what it does so well I hope to see much harsherstricter copyright
 and patent laws for computer algorithms concepts interfaces and
 other intellectual properties to protect real innovators Id hate to
 be one who actually does innovate and then have Microsoft come in
 like a huge vulture and use their brute mass development staff
 marketing etc to get fat off of my innovation I dont have all
 that much sympathy for Apples complaint against Microsoft since
 they just took the ideas from Xeroxs PA Research Center when the
 Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over
 antitrust fears However for other companies and individuals who
 have a great idea yet get it borrowed by larger corporations who
 can afford to quickly bring it to market without any licensing from
 the original innovator I feel much sympathy

You cant even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knockoff packages and peddles them to
neophytes  If MS does anything it appears someone has to do it
first  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution
