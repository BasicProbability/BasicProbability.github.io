 BS since I dont know your setup

 BS COPY B WINCNFVGALOGOLGOVGALOGORLE WINCOM

 BS I grabbed this from Supercharging Windows by Judd Robbinsgreat book
 BS This is also how you can put your own logo into the Windows startup
 
NOW another thing
this is from the windows FAQ
 
your file has to be less than 64 K
 at least thats what the faq says but Mine wont work for more than
about 30maybe they mend 32K I dont know

COM files are limited to a total size of 64KB  Thus wincfn plus vgalogolog 
plus your RLE file must be less than 64KB  Thus your RLE file should be 
around 30KB
