Subject Re Help with changing Startup logo

There has been a long running discussion over changing the Startup
logo for Windows for a few weeks here While all the COPY methods are
great  havent seen any mention of a program that will do it for
you 

Well I found one on CICA called winlogo Cant remember where
unfortuantely and it seems to work real well even comes with a
couple example RLE files 

What Id really like though is a way to create RLE files myself
specifically the RLE4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file Can
anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a REAL directory
path  All the ones Ive seen mentioned didnt pan out
