Subject Need help with WordPerfect 52 for windows

	Im trying to install WordPerfect 52 for windows on my computer  Im
running a 386sx25 w 2meg ram and a 4meg virtual mem setting for windows  I
keep getting errors when I try to run WP52  It tells me that I dont have
enough memory or disk space since I have 47megs free on the HD Im assuming
that I dont have enough memory  Can anyone tell me what it takes to run
this beast  Thanks
