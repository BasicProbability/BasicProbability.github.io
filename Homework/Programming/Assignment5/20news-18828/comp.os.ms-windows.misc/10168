If you think that windows is useable you must not use it much  Windows 
version of crash protection is wearing a helmet while computing  The arir
air bag is an expensive addon

You must of read too many OS2 advertisements  Crash Protection is such
a marketing gimick it isnt funny  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my 
new machine Ive only had it crash ONCE and I dont have a run of the mill
configuration

Microsoft is not a leader in innovation but they certainly know how to 
build a better mousetrap  Now whats wrong with that

It does sound funny I will admit  But for me it is true  Windows crashed on
all of the time and from what I have read in PC Mag this is not the exception
  OS2 gives each windows app a VDM and they cant touch each other or
generally anything they arent supposed to have  If windows works for you
then great  Maybe this is why some people dont see why OS2 is the OS of 
choice  If windows doesnt crash on you and you dont mind waiting on each
task and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS some of the
key reasons for using OS2 are gone  I probably  would still use it but it
would be more of an even fight
