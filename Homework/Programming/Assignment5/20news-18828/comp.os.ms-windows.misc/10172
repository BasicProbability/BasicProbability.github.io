Subject Changing Windows fonts
From ellard2husc8harvardedu Daniel Ellard


A friend of mine uses Windows 31 to do most of her work
Unfortunately she has very bad eyesight and we havent
been able to figure out how to change the default font
used by the system and application menus or the font used
by the Help program what use is hypertext if you cant
read it to make it legible to her

If anyone knows how to increase the size of these fonts
of any software package that makes Windows more accessible
to visually handicapped people please let me know

Thanks
	Dan
