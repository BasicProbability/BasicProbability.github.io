Subject Coda Music Finale and Petrucci font problem


Ive been using Final from CODA for some time but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory a Postscript 
laser Win31 Finale 201 and I recently installed ATM 20 Ive been 
fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time and when I needed to do 
some work with Finale things didnt print properly It might  and it might 
not  have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1something to 
20 but I dont have the old ATM lying around anomore 

The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didnt print which is a 
rather important font  

I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS0 in the 
Finale section of WININI but Compile PostScript Listing still doesnt 
work and its those EPS files I need When I look at the eps files 
generated the only font which appears there is Courier I found out that if I 
manually changed the Courier 24point to Petrucci 24point in the EPS file 
everything worked ok but Id rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs 
to work with 

And yes in the SpecialFontFont names dialog box all the fonts I need are 
listed with the correct mapping between Finale Screen and Printer fonts 
Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well that is after I included OwnPS0 and all my other Windows 
applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well 

Has anyone encountered problems like this 

What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software I have 201

Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X400

Id be grateful for all hints and help                                mats
