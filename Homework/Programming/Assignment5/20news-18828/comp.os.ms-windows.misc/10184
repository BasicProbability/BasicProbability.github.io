Subject Novell and Windows 31

	Im working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell
network using shell version 322 I think The workstation a 386 was set
up to run Windows 30 with the network about a year ago Needless to say
Id like to upgrade it to Windows 31 and have it work with the network

	Basically the Windows filesd be on the local hard drive but
several DOS applications like Word Perfect will be on the network Id
mainly want Windows to access the network drives the network printers and
perhaps handle some network functions as well If I could multitask the DOS
apps whose executables are on the network thatd be great but I could live
without it

	Eventually Id like to get a few other 486s in the office working
with the network and Windows 31 as well However most of the terminals
are 286s which leaves the network pretty much DOSbound and I guess that
leaves out Windows for Workgroups And in the future maybe thered be
Norton desktop but thats gettingahead of myself

	As you can guess Ive never done anything like this before Ive
read through the networks material that came with Windows but still Id
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area

	Please reply by Email I dont scan these newsgroups often

	Thanks for any replies
