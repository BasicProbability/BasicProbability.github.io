Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft supporters

Hey Larry
        How can you be a comp sci major and never crash a damn computer
What does your CS dept teach youor are you just that good of a programmer
that not one of your assembly programs have ever downed your machine

Crash Protection is such
a marketing gimick it isnt funny  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my
new machine Ive only had it crash ONCE and I dont have a run of the mill
configuration

Why do you bother putting up such stupid postsor are you that ignorant
