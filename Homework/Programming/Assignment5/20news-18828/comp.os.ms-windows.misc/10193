    Hi
      Ive been using Plannet Crafters Plugin for Program Manager

	The best one Ive seen is CEO by Sloop Software  They have a
	sharware version but the retail version is only 4050  Its
	incredibly complete subfolders to any level choose any icon
	hot keys drop down menus button bars etc  Havent found
	anything it doesnt do  Try mailing 72540144compuservecom
	for details

	Tom
