Subject Windows 31 Video Driver


Ive got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and Im
looking for a Windows 31 Driver for it  Its based on the Cirrus Logic
CLGD510A32PCB chip  Ive contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand
and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer
So if theres a V31 driver out for this chip set Id like to know  
preferably by email at rjwjameswaikatoacnz
                     
Thanks is advance

Ross James
