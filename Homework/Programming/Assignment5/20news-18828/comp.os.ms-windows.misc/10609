Subject Driver for Chips  Technologies Video Board Needed

I would like to find a Windows 3x driver for a video board that is
based on the Chips  Technologies chipset  The actual board is a
Scorpion Framegrabber made by Univision  It is based on the CT
chipset but only barely supports the graphics mode  I am hoping that
any CT driver could be used in the 640x480x256 mode

Thanks
