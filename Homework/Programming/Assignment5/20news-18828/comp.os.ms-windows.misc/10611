But I dont want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree  it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
some files  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car

You dont and never had to  Thats what enhanced shells are for  Remember 
4DOS and NDOS  I mean come on you cant expect DOS to cover everything 
from R10  Microsoft has other projects to work on

 They want you to move to Windows 31 then later to Win32 and eventually to
 Cairo  This way they give you a reason to

By deliberately crippling the product  Surely no

Oh hold on I guess youre right  That certainly stinks of MicroSoft
marketing techniques

I dont think they deliberately crippled the project  On the other hand it 
IS a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
top of DOS  I mean you get a GUI with reasonable speed on a PC  With 
XWindows running on top of Linux or something similar youre still gonna 
need a fast processor

Re DOSs death
Well Amen to that but I wish it were a damn sight deader  For a dead
product its used an awful lot  And I suspect its going to carry on
twitching for a long while yet which isnt doing anyone any good

Except for the people who use DOS programs which means about 75 or more of 
the business world
