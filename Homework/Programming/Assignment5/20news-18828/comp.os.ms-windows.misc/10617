Subject WRK Installation Oddity

Last night I tried to reinstall the utilities from the Windows 31 Resource
Kit disk The setup program appeared to run perfectly normally but when it
had finished there was no Program Group created Now I know Ive done
this before successfully and creating a group myself didnt exactly tax
me but Im curious as to what might be going on I can only assume that
something left over from the last time I had it installed is getting in 
the way but I cant figure out what Any clues anyone
