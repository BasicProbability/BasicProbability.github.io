There is no need to load EMM386 QEMM or anything else on many
Windows PCs Its only useful if you are still stuck with running
MSDos based applications that need lots of low memory free

Otherwise you just need to load HIMEMSYS and let Windows go straight
to the Extended memory

thats what I thought thats why I never used emm386exe before
