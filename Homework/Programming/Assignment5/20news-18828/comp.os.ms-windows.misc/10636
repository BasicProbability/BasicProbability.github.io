This has gone on too long people Get a life

If you havent converted anyone to your way of thinking yet
you probably will not convert anyone Just let this subject
die a quiet though painfull death

If this keeps up Ill start believing the self righteousness
should be CAPITAL offense

Youll have to kill off half the net Maybe that isnt such a bad
idea
