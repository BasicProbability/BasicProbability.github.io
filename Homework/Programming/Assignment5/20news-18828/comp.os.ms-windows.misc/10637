Subject Remapping in Procomm4Windows

One can only remap specialcommand keys in procomm it seems I
would like to remap other keys too  especially altgr 2 and
such combinations

Anybody know a plain OR dirty way to do this of cause most
people settle for remapping function keys but I dont see
why there should be a limitation

	Yours Mattias
