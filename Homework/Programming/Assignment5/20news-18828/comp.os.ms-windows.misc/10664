 I had posted that it came from a survey of registered users I 
 doublechecked with a friendly neighborhood marketing type and
 found there were actually two surveys One of randomly selected
 resellers one of randomly selected users from the 6 upgrade 
 registered user database Both surveys showed a 93 positive
 rating

Which translates to 7 not satisfied  I dont think its the awkward 
recursive deletion thats bugging people it certainly isnt the nice Windows 
interfaces for new DOS accessories CPAV defrager undelete

	As far as Ive noticed its DoubleSpace crashes

Frankly the fairly high rates of DoubleSpace crashes Ive heard of surprises 
me  I figured that since the OS is presumably aware of DoubleSpace it is 
less likely to crash unlike Stacker which fools the OS but DO is gullible 
anyway   DOS 6 is aware of DoubleSpace isnt it

Anyway good job on DOS 5 and DOS 6 is good for new users  Just beware the 
doublespace
