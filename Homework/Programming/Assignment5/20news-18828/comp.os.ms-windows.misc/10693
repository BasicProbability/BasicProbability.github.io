Subject Disk Image Question

Hello

recently I noticed there is a directory named DiskImage in my disk  I didnt
notice it before and I wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created or if Win31 automatically created a backup of its files
I couldnt find any documentation on the diskimage utility having an image of
the disk is taking a lot of disk space  Does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed Win31 did or it is a backup mechanism

Thanks

Anibal
