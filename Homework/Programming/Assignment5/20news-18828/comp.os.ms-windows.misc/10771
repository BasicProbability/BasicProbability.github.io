Let me pose a question how many MSDOS users are out there who have no
access to the net but would probably find this feature useful too
Ie your suggestion implies that Microsoft is relying on the shareware
or PD products to fill the gaps on DOS Or did I misunderstand your
statement

Shareware is available from the net magazines distributors clubs
friends and bulletin boards I dont think people have any problems
getting hold of it

Fill gaps in Dos Theres no need for many people  Dos 5 provides
more services than I need as it is I just run Windows on top of it

BTW my Windows must be an operating system  it provides a Disk
Operating System that Dos cant access NFS
