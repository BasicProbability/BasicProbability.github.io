Subject Re Demonstration Creation Program Wanted

    Im looking for a program or toolkit with which it is possible
to create demonstrations very fast With a demonstration I mean a
collection of screens The one that is looking to the demonstration
should be able to make choices by pressing buttons to change
screens hypertext
    Each screen will contain a question text or bitmap and a few
answers buttons It should be possible to play music andor show
animations film
    Ive heard of animator pro and visual basic but I dont know
what these can do

Autodesk Animator is a good tool The one I like is Show PartnerFX If
you want it I could give a copy to you I did a lot of advertising with it 
it lets you create both graphics ANY resolution and text frames run it all
as a film you can make choices and include music  I guess thats just
what you need If youre really interested email me
