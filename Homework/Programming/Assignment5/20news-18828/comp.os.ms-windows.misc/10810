Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac disks  
Ive never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I cant say that it works cause it doesnt read 800K
disks it only reads 144Mb If there a program that does read 800K disks
please let me know

Im not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the 800k
disk  I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a
PC 35 cant read it  This is a hardware problem which software cannot
correct  Hope this helps and correct me if Im wrong
