Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac
disks  Ive never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I cant say that it works cause it doesnt read 800K
disks it only reads 144Mb If there a program that does read 800K disks
please let me know

Im not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the 800k
disk  I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a
PC 35 cant read it  This is a hardware problem which software cannot
correct  Hope this helps and correct me if Im wrong

Youre right

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 35 disk or Apple II
525 disk without extra hardware However Mac 144MB disks can be read
and written in a PC 35 HD drive with software only 

This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file It sure gets
asked enough
