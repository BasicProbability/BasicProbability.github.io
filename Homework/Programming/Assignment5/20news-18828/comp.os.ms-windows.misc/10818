Subject Re Challenge to Microsoft supporters

WinOS2 is IBM work You make me laugh Rewriting couple of thousands
lines of code to make Windows compatible with your DPMI implementation does
not make the rest of Windows IBM work

I dont think MS has anything to brag about when it comes to following
DPMI But then consistency is the hobgoblin etc I suppose
