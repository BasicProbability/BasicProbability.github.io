Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac disks  
Ive never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I cant say that it works cause it doesnt read 800K
disks it only reads 144Mb If there a program that does read 800K disks
please let me know


Well you cant say that it dont work  The inability to read 800k mac
disks is not a SW problem  Rather its a HARDWARE limmitation on PCs 

I have seen a post about a program able to read non144Mb Mac disks
which comes with a watchamacalit ma memorys faling card which you
just drop into a com port or something  Dont remember specifics tho
