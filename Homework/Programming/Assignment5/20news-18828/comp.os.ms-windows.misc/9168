Apparently not Many people complain about the confusion that
results from the filemanagerprogman split Its just a basic
flaw

I have one thing to say why does everyone say that spliting them up is
such a bad thing  I actually like my program launcher and file manager
do be seperate it make things easier to figure out I mean take a look 
at OS2s wps no flames I personally hate it cause I just
have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy

and dont say just drag the icon Cause I hate icons in the first place
I have too much trouble telling what all those little push buttons mean
I want File Copy etc 

although I know Im in the minority
