Is there a freeshare ware package that will allow multiple
desktops in windows 31  What is desired is to have a desk top
for several people that each can personalize by name and choice
of programs etc 


Theres a package called Workspace on cica that has 5 desktops I
havent done much with it yet but it seems to be able to do what you
want it to

Dont have the exact archive name handy but its something like
wspaceblahzip
