 I often use Notepad to view and print readme type files I often find
 myself rushing to get to Print Manager to stop the printer and delete
 the file from the print queue because Ive forgotten to reset the print
 margins from 75 inches left and right to 0 inches The resulting printed
 text looks all chopped up because of the hard returns in the source file
 


	I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well until I
finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133 and dug into
NOTEPADEXE there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to 
00 margins its hardwired into code 

	Do a SEARCH for 75 then change the offending bytes to 00 
et viola Who are the guys who hardcode these options anyway

	Im interested in whether the problem only rears its ugly head for 
certain printers Im using an old Epson LX800 or is that EX800 never can 
remember

aloha
