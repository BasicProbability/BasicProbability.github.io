	ahh yes this is a fun topic  No once the name is incribed on the
disk that is it it is encoded  Not even a HEX editor will find it  You can
write over the Licensed to but you cant change the name underneth it  I

I can find it with a HEX editor although I have not tried to overwrite it
Are you sure it cant be  You may be mistaken about this 

You can change it As part of a continuously downsizing Government
organization my code branch changes about once a year I just
finished changing the registration information using Norton Utilities
I sent the original requester the hex offset into USEREXE containing
the information and his reply indicated he got several similar answers

And its not encoded in any way As for the legality theres nothing
that keeps me from changing the information it certainly doesnt reach
out and alter the serial number printed on the inside of my manual
