Subject How do I make GhostScript work

What files do I need to download for GhostScript 252  I have never used
GhostScript before so I dont have any files for it  What I do have is
gs252winzip which I downloaded from Cica  Unfortunately it doesnt seem to
work on its own but needs some more files that I dont have  I want to run
GhostScript both in Windows 31 and in MSDOS on a 386 PC I understand theres
versions for both environments  What are all the files I need to download and
where can I get them  Any info would be appeciated
