	I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well until I
finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133 and dug into
NOTEPADEXE there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to 
00 margins its hardwired into code 
 
	Do a SEARCH for 75 then change the offending bytes to 00 
et viola Who are the guys who hardcode these options anyway
 
	Im interested in whether the problem only rears its ugly head for 
certain printers Im using an old Epson LX800 or is that EX800 never can 
remember
