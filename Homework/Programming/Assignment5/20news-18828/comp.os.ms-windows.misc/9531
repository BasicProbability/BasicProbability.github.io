Hi

	THe best sound conversion program Ive ever seen is SoundTool which
is shareware from Germany  I found a copy somewhere in wuarchivewustledu
a long time ago but I dont know offhand what directory it was under  Its
GREAT at converting files of all types including Mac NExT Sun and
various PC formats Its also a great player and editor with various
special effects that put Windows Sound Recorder to shame  It requires a
driver for various sound cards The only builtin one is for the pc speaker
and even that sounds pretty good but if youre just using it to convert
things you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound
Recorder

Give it a try

Bret
