Subject Gatewaying Microsoft MailWorkgroups via 9600 modem

Our student association runs a small Novell network which has a subnetwork
of Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft Mail The Director of Finance en
electrical engineering student would like to gateway this system either
via SLIP or not into the Universitys network and thus the Internet at
the very least to exchange email but possibly also to do ftps etc For
now this would be done via a 9600 bps modem

He would like to set it up so that it would periodically call in to check
mail but would otherwise connect whenever needed

What is the best way to do this Gatewaying software is available but
what works best

Please reply to me dkmillerunixgubcca

is best If this is a common question please pot me to a FAQ or ftp site
