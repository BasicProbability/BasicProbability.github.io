As the subjects says Windows 31 keeps crashing givinh me GPF on me of  
late  It was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every  
day  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie I  

Have you tried setting FILES in your configsys file to a fairly high
number Ive got mine set to 100 Ive seen numbers from 40 to 100 
recommended Also check your STACKS statement STACKS9256 is a good
starting point Try increasing it if its already set there such as
to STACKS12256 etc Both STACKS and FILES have been identified as
one cause of frequent Win31 crashes
