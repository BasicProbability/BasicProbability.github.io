Chicogo is what I want to use  It is like NT a true OS with thrue 
multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements 
and does not meet DOD security specs but thats okay since it will probably 
be more of a client OS  there are a few otehr differences but those are the 
main ones  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August
	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Microoft are in intense 
competition so it is said  However I think a different relationship will 
arise NT will be the server Netowrk Techonology Chicogo will be the 
client machine  It is entirely possible for different OSs to work together 
partly because Chicogo is just a small NT think of it that way anyway  
Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS so dont
scorn the concept
	Anyway dont expect it soon  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be 
released next year read see it in 95 so I expect that Chicogo wont be out 
til 96
How does Chicago differ from the sort of announced Windows 4 My understand
ing at least from the InbfoWorld accound of Windows 4 is that its sort
of NT Litea fullfledged operating system but lacking server and security
features that make NT such a bear Is W4 not true multithreading

 
	Can anyone tell me how ChicagoWindows 4 would differ from
OS2 2x  Believe it or not Im not trying to start a flame war
here   Im simply curious  if there is going to be any feature
advantage in either of these products I do not consider the fact that
it has uncle bills seal of approval much of a feature
