Does anyone out there know if there are print drivers for Windows for the
Panasonic KXP1091i 9pin dot matrix printer

  Ive been told that Panasonic has uploaded some to Compuerve but I
dont have a CIS account  I just use the Epson FX80 driver myself
and it comes out very pretty if very slowly on my 1080i
