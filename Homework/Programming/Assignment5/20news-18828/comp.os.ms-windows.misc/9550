Does anybody have any idea where I could find a program that can
convert a GIF image into a BMP image suitable for a Windows 
wallpaper ie 256 colors  Hopefully theres something out there
I can get from an ftp site somewhere

Thanks in advance

Scott

look on ftpcicaindianaedu for gwszip They embed the release
number in the name and Im not sure what the lates is It is Graphics
Workshop There is a DOS and a Windows version Both work Great I even
had someone bring me some images from the Amiga and converted them to
great looking wallpaper as 256color BMP files

If you cant find it repost or let me know and Ill dig up the archive
