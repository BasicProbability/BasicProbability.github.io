	ahh yes this is a fun topic  No once the name is incribed on the
disk that is it it is encoded  Not even a HEX editor will find it  You can

But a disk compare utility old versus new will  And Windows 31 is
also flexible enough at install time that you can copy all the files
onto your hard disk which greatly speeds things up and makes them
less annoying if you can spare the 7 or so compressed megs

write over the Licensed to but you cant change the name underneth it  I
think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate and were not
going to promote that here

No were not  But were also not going to promote pandering to
corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience  I dont like
dealing with floppies  Personally I have no use for changing the
registration info but I see it as a valid need and one that ought to
be solved using a quick little utility rather than a halfhour
reinstall thats just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one
way or another

So while Im not going to put much time into it myself heres the
procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information

1  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want
to install it  Ive been using cWINSTALL myself

2  From there copy that directory to something like cWINORIG

3  Install from cwinstall

4  comp the two directories to determine changes  
    ie comp  winorig reporttxt

5  Look in the report file for the files that change  Assuming
they didnt cover themselves covering their own tracks at least one
file should have a difference noted at a particular offset  Locate
said offset in the original directory and see whats there using a hex
editor and do the same for the modified one

6  Youre on your own as far as breaking the code goes I dont
really do cryptography  Its probably just an xor key or something I
think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing
his copy than with real pirates who will probably just disassemble
the damned thing anyway  This technique should work with just about
any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original
floppies when you install in some extreme cases you may not be able
to back the floppies up to hard disk and will be stuck doing a
compare on floppies Lotus stuff is probably like that

As I noted before if you can afford the space on the hard disk and
dont do much in the way of customization reinstalling from one
directory to another may be less arduous  Doing some of the stuff
Ive mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft as if
theyd ever find out  If you arent careful with the disk editor you
could also mung something important duh  I guess thats a
disclaimer

Have at it
