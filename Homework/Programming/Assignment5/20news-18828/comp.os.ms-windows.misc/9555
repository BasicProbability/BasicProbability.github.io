I have an IBM and run Windows 31  A friend installed Norton Desktop For
Windows on top of this  It loads automatically when I type win and
surely adds to the already dismally slow process of starting up
 
I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program
Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off

    1 Get the friend to uninstall it
    2 Read the manual though from your post I infer that you are using
    pirated software
    3 Go into SYSINI and change the SHELL line to read SHELLPROGMANEXE
