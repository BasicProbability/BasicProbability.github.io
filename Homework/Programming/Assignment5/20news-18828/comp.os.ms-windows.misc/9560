Here are some cool 3D background patterns I made

Edit your CONTROLINI and add the following lines to your Patterns section

Tile1 43 85 43 85 43 85 255
Tile diagonal148 107 54 156 73 182 99 201

Make sure your desktop color is one of the standard 16 colors or the
patterns might not work  I like dark grey the best with these

If you have any cool ones of your own please mail them to me
