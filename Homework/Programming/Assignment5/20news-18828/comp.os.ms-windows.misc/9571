Subject  DOS font size in windows


	I have an 8514A card and I am using windows in 1024x768 mode 
	normal 8514A font not small  In the 386 enhanced mode
	the DOS window font is too small for my 14 monitor Is there a 
	way to spacify the font size for the DOS window Youll have to 
	excuse me if there is a trivial answer since I am fairly new to
	MS Windows world

	Thanks
