Subject Re How do I make GhostScript work


you Need gs252inizip and 24zip and 25zip font files You can get these
from  wuarchivewustledu mirrorsmsdospostscript I also advice you to get
gs252guizip from CICA It is a nice interface for ghostscript Ghostscript is
very user unfriendly This interface makes it user friendly For using this
interface you have to get vbrun100dll from riscuaedu pubnetworkmisc
copy this to your windows directory Copy gui executables and other files to
your ghostscript directory And anter the line below to your autoexecbat

SET GSLIBCyour ghostscript and gui directory

Now you are ready to use it Enjoy it

What files do I need to download for GhostScript 252  I have never used
GhostScript before so I dont have any files for it  What I do have is
gs252winzip which I downloaded from Cica  Unfortunately it doesnt seem to
work on its own but needs some more files that I dont have  I want to run
GhostScript both in Windows 31 and in MSDOS on a 386 PC I understand theres
versions for both environments  What are all the files I need to download and
where can I get them  Any info would be appeciated
