Subject Fahrenheit 1280 problems help


Hi

  I recently bought an Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 Its a real nice card
but Im having very big problems with it

  The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display
in windows Something like every other line or so
Also when I use a DOS gif viewer namely vpic 60c in Fahrenheit 1280
mode vertical lines are swapped Its very strange looking
If it uses VESA standards however it works great only it thinks theres
only 512K on the card Theres 1MB on there

  I have contacted Orchid support and they tried to be helpful but didnt
have the answer I dont think the card is the problem since it works great
on my friends computer

  Here is my setup
Fahrenheit 1280 1MB bios 11
38625 Optichipset2 AMI bios 1990 5MB ram
Maxtor 120MB harddrive slave
Maxtor 40Mb harddrive master
Panasonic c1381 monitor
version 46 windows drivers
windows 31
I tried taking all memory managers etc off and took all other cards
besides disk controller off

  My friends setup is 386sx16 shamrock monitor

If anyone has seen anything like this or can otherwise help I will be very
greatful
