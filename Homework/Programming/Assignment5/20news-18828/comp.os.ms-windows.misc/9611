Subject Re Borlands Paradox Offer

I am considering buying Borlands Paradox for Windows since I
would like to use a database with Windows I dont haveuse
one yet for both workhome use  I would like to advantage
of Borlands 12995 until April 30 offer if this package
is everything that Borland claims it to be  So I was
wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions

Ive been using MS Access still available from some stores for 9900
and I am quite pleased with it  Its relatively easy to learn very easy
to use and somewhat easy to program  I highly recomend it particularly
at 9900  I have not used Paradox for Windows but I dont expect it to
be 3000 better than Access IMHO
