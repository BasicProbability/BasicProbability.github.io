Subject How do I quickly switch between Windows screen resolutions

 
Can someone out there tell me how to switch Windows screen resolution
quickly and easily  I know that I can go back into install to do it
but what Id really like is to have is the ability to just change a
couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
changed  I already have both video drivers that I need on my system
so that isnt a problem
 
Thanks
