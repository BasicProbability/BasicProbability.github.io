Subject Re WPPCF Linux RISC


  The RISC means reduced instruction set computer The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC
 hmm not that I am an authority on RISC  but I clearly remember
 reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
 The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
 as orthogonal is CISC

There are some things you might be interested to know about todays RISC
processors  It is true that there are fewer instructions but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications
As a compromise many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set and a Complex one

This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors Intel has 
certainly proved that

What I want to know is what does this have to do with this group

             Some people say its fun but I think its very serious
