How do you set up an app to give its window a default start up
position and size

Try sizeitzip from ftpcicaindianaedu 129792084 in the directory 
ftppubpcwin3desktop Its freeware

Also noticed there a program called sizer110zip which from the description
looks like it also does what you want

Hope this helps
