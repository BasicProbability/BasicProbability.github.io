Subject format as under Win  DOS6 

Has anyone experienced problems formatting a system floppy in the File
Manager under DOS 6  I get a formatted disk but when I boot with it
my hard drive isnt recognized  I did install DoubleSpace  Also I
was able to make a goodworking system floppy from the DOS 6 command
shell no Windows

Let me know if youve had this problem too and if youve heard whats
going on
