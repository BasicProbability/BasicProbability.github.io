Subject exit codes dossorry for wrong group  


Hey now  First of all sorry to post this DOS question in a WINDOWS
group but Im in kinda a hurry so I cant scramble to find the dos
groups names  

Anyway anyone know where I ccan find the exit codes to DOS commands
the manual doesnt seem to have all of them  Im particularly looking
for COPY in order to make a move batch file such that if the file
wasnt coppied properly it wont be deleted


please email lourayseasgwuedu
Thanks IA
Mickey
