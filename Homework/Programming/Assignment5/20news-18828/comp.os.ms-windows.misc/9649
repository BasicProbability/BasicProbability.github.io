DA Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 
DA driver Sorry dont know the version of the driver no indication in the 
DA menus but its a recently delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the 
DA latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered if anyone else had seen this

No not at all Im using SS24X with BIOS 203 and driver
from 13 Januar 93 Ive never had any problems with the
mouse cursor
Is there already a newer driver published


Greetings
