Hi its an easy question for you Windows gurus  Id appreciate any help

We need to write an online help for our application  We dont have
Windows Software Developers Toolkit yet   Since we just want to build
a HLP file around Windows help engine I hope it wont be that complicated
Anyway could someone kindly give me some hints of how to build such an
online help if it does not take 100 pages to explain Or if it is complicated
would you help to point out what I would need to do it

Hi

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HCEXE or HC31EXE file to 
compile and generate HLP files out of RTF files
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W

If this is not the solution be more specific about your application
