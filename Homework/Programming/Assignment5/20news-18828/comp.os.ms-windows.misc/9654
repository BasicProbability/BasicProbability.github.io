Subject Re More Cool BMP files

 
I downloaded the CompuServe GIF of the month  A raytraced image of
a golf ball next to a hole  Very nice 640x480x256 bitmap easily
converted to a Windows BMP  If anyone wants I could upload a copy
on Cica


Please doand let us know specifics  lest Im the only one on this
