Now does anyone know if it is possible to use W4WG and Lan Workplace
for DOS at the same time 

Yup  Were using both and they work just fine  Hopefully someday WFWG
will communicate over LWP TCPIP  Right now we have to load NetBeui

I use ODI with ODINSUP and all works well

Hey sounds great Does that mean that W4WG works with ODI I thought it    
uses NDIS                                                                  
                                                                            
My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my    
UMBs so Id hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work       
along                                                                     
                                                                           
I read in a German computer magazine that TCPIP support for W4WG is just  
around the corner Anybody have any news about this                       
                                                                           
Regards Richard
