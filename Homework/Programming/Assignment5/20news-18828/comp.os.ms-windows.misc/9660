If you need just to change the wallpaper then Ive written a short
program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfofunction
The bad news is that you need VBRUN200DLL to run it and the DLL is
some 350kb the program is about 7kb The order of pictures depends
on the system date and the number of BMPfiles in the directory so
the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times
during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed

If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email
it to you It is unavailable via ftp
