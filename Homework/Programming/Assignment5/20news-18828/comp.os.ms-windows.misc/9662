I remember reading about a program that made windows icons run away
from the mouse as it moved near them  Does anyone know the name
of this program and the ftp location probably at cica

Theres a program called Icon Frightener included with the book Stupid
Windows Tricks by Bob LeVitus and Ed Tittel AddisonWesley 1992  Its
freeware  If its not on the net anywhere Ill happily email a copy to
someone whos willing to upload it I cant upload through our Internet
firewall
