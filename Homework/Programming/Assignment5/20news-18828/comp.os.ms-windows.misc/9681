Subject Serial Printing

Hi
	Weve been having problems on a few setups when printing to a
serial printer dmp or Laser I have used Works and Windows Write The
output is OK from DOS and if I send plain text output but anything
fancy garbles or just doesnt output The exception is outputting to a
Lserjet 4 which appears to be fast enough receiving data not to
bother about handshaking messages Im sure Im not alone in this Ive
tried most of the PrintNetwork manager options I can think of Anyone
had similar problems theyve cured and would like to tell me bout it
Thanks

John Atherton
