Subject ATM


Ive been reading with much confusion about whether or not to use
ATManager Lately all the packages Ive been buying have all
included ATManager as a bonus
I do some desktop publishing using PageMaker and Coreldraw
Coreldraw comes with a nifty laser disk that contains over 200 diff
types Add that to the TTfonts that come with win31 and you have a
decent amount of fonts I print my creations out on an HP4
Postcript at 600 dpi resolution with the Resolution Enhancement 
Technology and   well  I get some darn good copies 
So good that there isnt any diff whether or not ATManager is turned
on or not Is it worth it to run ATM at all Especially with these
better printer technologies  and TT
