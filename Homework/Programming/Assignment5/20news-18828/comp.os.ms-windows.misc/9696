Subject Re Utility for updating Winini and systemini

Sorry I didnt tell exactly what I need

I need a utility for automatic updating deleting adding changing of ini files for Windows 
The program should run from Dos batchfile or the program run a script under Windows

I will use the utility for updating the winini and other files on meny PCs  

Do I find it on any FTP host
