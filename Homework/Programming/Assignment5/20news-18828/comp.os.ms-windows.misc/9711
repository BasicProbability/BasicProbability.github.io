 Sorry I didnt tell exactly what I need
 
 I need a utility for automatic updating deleting adding changing of ini files for Windows 
 The program should run from Dos batchfile or the program run a script under Windows
 
 I will use the utility for updating the winini and other files on meny PCs  
 
 Do I find it on any FTP host

Well in the latest Windows magazine there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk Uninstaller
but it can be used to update a network but only for deleting not adding
or changing their ini files  Uninstaller by MicroHelp Inc  79

I am also looking for an ini updater for my PC network and so far without
any luck  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and its batch
language to its limitlook into DOS 50s I am assumming that DOS 60
has the same command maybe even moreor lessimproved REPLACE command
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows  This basically overwrites
their color schemes but does what I need it to do  Not neat but does
the jobIm looking for a better solution though
