I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX  I have been running Windows
without a swap file for several months  Will Mathcad 40 be
happy with this or insist on a swap file

Presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file If Windows needs a
swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesnt exist
Permanent is generally faster though I dont know why Mathcad wouldnt
be happy with either typeVer 30 is and so should any program conforming
to the Win specification
