Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver  Theres
a soundexe file that claims to be the driver but Im suspicious since
its not a drv file  

Thats the file


To clarify a little more SOUNDEXE is a selfexpanding archive which
contains the driver which is actually called SPEAKERDRV I think
