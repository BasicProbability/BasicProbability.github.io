Subject FileManager strange sizes in summary line

I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently
Usually the line at the bottom of the FileManager the status bar I
guess displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection  If I select a whole bunch of files I will get
an exact byte count

Recently I notice it incorrectly displays this count its truncating
If I select a file that is say 532 bytes it correctly displays 532 bytes
If I select select a file that is 23482 bytes it displays 23 bytes 
not 23 Kbytes just 23 bytes  If I select 893352 it will report only
893 bytes in the selection  If I select over a Meg worth of files say
3356345 it reports 3 bytes  Its as if its got a problem with displaying
more than 3 characters

My system 486DX33 8M memory Stacker 30 DOS 5 Win 31  Ive run
the latest virus scanners scan102 fprot and they didnt report anything
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger
