Sorry I didnt tell exactly what I need

I need a utility for automatic updating deleting adding changing of
ini 
files for Windows 
The program should run from Dos batchfile or the program run a script
under Windows

I will use the utility for updating the winini and other files on
meny PCs  

Do I find it on any FTP host

 Svein


If you are managing PCs on a Novell network get the network management
tools provided by either Sabre Software or Automated Design Systems 
Among the many features youll find utilities that can help you to
manage INI files stored on users workstations or home directories 
This is commercial software and well worth the money  To date I have
not found ANYTHING available via FTP that could compare  Reply to the
address in my SIG for more info
