 Can someone out there tell me how to switch Windows screen resolution
 quickly and easily  I know that I can go back into install to do it
 but what Id really like is to have is the ability to just change a
 couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
 changed  I already have both video drivers that I need on my system
 so that isnt a problem
  
 Thanks

There is a shareware program called vswitchzip I dont remember if it  
is on wuarchivewustledu or on ftpcicaindianaedu  

It is easy to use and does the job with no problem
