Very simple  You have to have the MOUSECOM or MOUSESYS loaded in DOS
before you run Windows  Note that you dont need to have these files loaded
to use the mouse in Windows

One addition to this I dont know if it applies to everybody  For my
Microsoft 400dpi mouse to work with windowed DOS apps I had to use the
driver that came with Windows Version 820  81 didnt allow me to do
it for some reason


I could never find the Microsoft mouse driver on my Windows 31 installation
disks but DOS 60 also has version 820 of MOUSECOM
