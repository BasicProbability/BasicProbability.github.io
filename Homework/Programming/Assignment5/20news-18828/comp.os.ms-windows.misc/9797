 I have a 486DX33 computer with a SoundBlaster 10 card  Im running
 Microsoft Windows v31  I have the SB driver set up properly to play
 normal sounds WAV files etc  I want to play midi files through the
 Media Player that is included with windows  I know I have to set up the
 patch maps or something in the MIDIMapper in the Control Panel  I KNOW
 NOTHING ABOUT MIDI  This is to be the way Ill get my feet wet

 How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files
If you install the Soundblaster windows drivers correctly and have
the latest drivers the media player should be setup to play files
authored to Microsofts Multimedia midi authoring standard General
Midi see the section in the back of the Voyetra manual in the
Soundblaster midi upgrade kit
Youll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different
mappings so dont expect them to always sound correct without using
some kind of midi file editor such as Voyetras Sequencer Plus

You can attempt to use the midimapper to remap the patches for
soundblaster but since you cannot modify the sbfmdrv you are allways
stuck with the instruments that come with this driver  Unless you can
find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in
sbfmdrv  I would suggest you locate the early version of
soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt32 voices and the later
drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices
