Subject Re Canon BJ200 BubbleJet and HP DeskJet 500

I edited a few newsgroup from that line dont like to crosspost THAT
much  I cant compare the two but I recently got an HP DeskJet 500

Im very pleased with the output remember that Im used to imagens
laser and postscript printers at school  looks very good  You have
to be careful to let it dry before touching it as it will smudge

The deskjet is SLOW  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares

The interface between Win31 and the printer is just dandy Ive not
had any problems with it

Hope that helps some

Cindy
