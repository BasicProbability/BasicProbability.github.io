An earlier article in this newsgroup made reference to
WinQVTNet version 34 Realy Where I tried archie
with no luck Its probably just a typo

Not a typo  It was uploaded to ftpcicaindianaedu a couple days back

But I sure would like to get one if its real as I too
have a printer problem in WinQVT

Version 34 uses standard Windows printer drivers
