Subject MSWindows access for the blind
Date Thu 22 Apr 1993 172514 GMT
We are developing an MSWindows based product that uses a full screen window
to display 24 rows of textual data  Is there any product for Microsoft Windows
that will enable blind individuals to access the data efficiently quickly 

Please email responses and I will post a summary to this group

Thanks for any help
 John Bruno


Apparently Microsoft came out with a new product MSBraille it is suppose 
to be WYTIWIG  

No offense

AT the MICROOFT display at FOSE there were a few computers running
windows and win apps for the  blind I think  Didnt pay much
attention to it but it was there
