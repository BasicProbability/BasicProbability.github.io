The deskjet is SLOW  This is in comparison to the other printers I
mentioned  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares

The interface between Win31 and the printer is just dandy Ive not
had any problems with it

I just bought a BJ200 printer a couple of days ago  I compared it to the
sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasnt for me  The
BJ200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality  I can compare it
with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical 
depending on the kind of paper  I dont have problems with the ink not
being dry it seems to dry VERY fast  Probably within a second  Since
Canon is giving a 50 rebate until the end of May it is really a good buy

How much is the BJ going for  I got mine for 300 which was in the
end the deciding factor for me
