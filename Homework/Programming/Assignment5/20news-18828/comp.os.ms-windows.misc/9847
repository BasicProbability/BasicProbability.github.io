Subject MEWIN Latex Help

I posted this to the apps group and didnt get any response so
Ill try here I am trying to use the latex help feature
available in emacs for windows and read that you need a separate
latexhlpzip file along with a vms2hlpzip file to convert this
to windows help Has anyone found these files or gotten this
command help to work

Thanks Steve Herrod
