Subject overlapped window without a title bar


Hi 

I have a simple question Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME
window without a title bar ie

	WSOVERLAPPED  WSTHICKFRAME  WSCAPTION 


I dont seem to be able to get rid off the title bar

I have another question

I have a overlapped windowsay V which has few child windows abc etc
The window shows up with all its children fine Now I create another 
childt with a WSTHICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
its siblings Style WSTHICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it How do
I make sure that the child t will always be at the top of its siblings
I used SetWindowPos and BringWindowToTop without success Whats happening
is that while I am resizing t it shows up but as soon as I let go it goes
behild its siblings

Any help would be greatly appreciated
