Hey now  First of all sorry to post this DOS question in a WINDOWS
group but Im in kinda a hurry so I cant scramble to find the dos
groups names  

Anyway anyone know where I ccan find the exit codes to DOS commands

There are 3 alternatives
1 You can try to write a small C program something like

   int myintvar
   myintvar  systemcommand

   and display myintvar value which is the exit code of the command

2 Or use 4doscom instead of commandcom it has built in move command
   you can also get any program exist code by using the exec function
   of 4dos

   cecho execcommand

   will display the exit code of the command

3 Get DOS 6 not worth buying if you already have QEMMPCToolsNorton
   and you only need the move utility

the manual doesnt seem to have all of them  Im particularly looking
for COPY in order to make a move batch file such that if the file
wasnt coppied properly it wont be deleted


please email lourayseasgwuedu
Thanks IA
