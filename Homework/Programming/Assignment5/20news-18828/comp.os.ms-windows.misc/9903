Subject help object appears thrice


Hey allI got an equation editor and since it didnt automagically
appear in my object dialog box ie insertobjectequation I
decided to manually place it there  So I went into winini is there
another way to do this the embedding section and added 

equationequationequationpathfilenamepicture

didnt work
quit windows go back  AHA mistake Correct it  It looks fine
start windowsdoesnt work  play with it for a while at one point
having two entries to see if one works and thother dont and finally I
get it to work  The only thing I can see thats different now is that
its now the first item on the list and it used to be the last  But
now I end up with three equation entried and all of them working
and only one entry in winini

so does any netian know whats wrong or rather how to correct this
ie make equationappear but once

Also all the entries in the embedding appear as above
Its obvious that pathfilename is the executable or whatever and
picture has something to do withthe way it appears
picturedescription

but what are the others
ie in

soundrecsoundsound
whates the difference between the 1st sound and the 2nd  
and what is soundrec I dont think its the name of the executable
as other entries eg MSWorksChart arent

thanks ia
Mickey
