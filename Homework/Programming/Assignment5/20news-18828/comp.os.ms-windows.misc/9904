Subject realizing colourswinini setting changes to y automatically

Mornin all  I was wonderin
I got screenpeace the screensaver which I think is very
good and I got a problem with it
There is an option there realize colour table and if its
switched on some wallpapers colours will get ucked up with
some screensavers eg the flashlight one  If I turn it off
however it works well and its faster so I have it off  Alls
nice and well  However If I turn it off then it will be on
again next time I start windows  All the setting are set in the
winini file and I do have save settings on exit selected

also I tried manually changing the setting in the winini file
to n for norealize colour table and started windows  It
will be fine for that session but the next session will again
turn the option on

I tried adding a R readonly attribute to my winini file and
it worked but my bitmap wallpaper saver didnt work then
Actually its the same application  Anywya it didnt work
since it must change the setting at the winini file

so anyone out there got any answerssuggesionscomments for me

thanks ia
