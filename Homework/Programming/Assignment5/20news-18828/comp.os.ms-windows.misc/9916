Subject W4WG  Novell

I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and Im having problems 
mapping drives in the filemanager

Situation
If I put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys NETX will run but I cant access
drive f to log in to Novell  
If I dont put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys I cant access other W4WG 
drives from the filemanager

It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE  
statement in my ConfigSys

I would appreciate any help  Its probably an easy problem that all you 
Windows gurus solved many many moons ago

Thanks
Tom Bilan
