Hi

sometime ago there are some discussions on gaining CompuServe access thru
the Internet But I seem to misplace those articles Can someone please
refresh me where which site I can telnet to to gain access

Hopefully I can download files as well

This should be in the FAQ it only get asked about twenty times a month

There is NO thats right NO telnet access to Compuserve no ftp access
no gopher accessno Internet services except email

You can telnet to hermesmeritedu but that routes you through Sprintnet
which is horrendously expensive
