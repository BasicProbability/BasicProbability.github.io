Subject Embedded TrueType Fonts

OKIve heard rumors about thisI might have even seen it in a few places
And Id like some infoIs it possible to embed fonts in a document Like 
Write Word or Ami Pro so the file can be printed on another machine that
doesnt have the font  If possible how is it done

Im sorry if this is a faqI couldnt find a faq listI would also 
apreciate knowing where that isif a windows faq exsists

Thanks in advance
