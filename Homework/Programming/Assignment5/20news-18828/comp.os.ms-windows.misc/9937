I am looking for Bernoulli removable tapes for the 2020 drive
Dont laugh  I am serious
If you have any 20 MB tapes lying around that you would like to get rid of
please mail me

You do mean disks dont you not tapes  You forgot to say whether you
were looking for the old 8 or the newer 525

WellI need the old 8 disks  You are right disks is a better word
but they are so big and calling them disks is kind of funny  but the
appropriate word is disks
