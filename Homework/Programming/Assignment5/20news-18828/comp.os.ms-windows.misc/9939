 If I put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys NETX will run but I cant access
 drive f to log in to Novell  
 If I dont put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys I cant access other W4WG 
 drives from the filemanager

 It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE  
 statement in my ConfigSys

First off I havent used W4WG but I think thats about to change

The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general and
in this case NETX in particular adds drives to the device chain 
Setting LASTDRIVEZ means there are no unassigned as opposed to
unused drive letters for NetWare to use as it tacks its drive
mappings onto the end of the existing list of drives  W4WG obviously
attaches its network drives to existing unused drive letters

Id guess the next thing Id try is something like LASTDRIVEM which on
most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still
allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well
