 The key issue that I bought my BJ200 on was ink drying speed

I was at the Trenton Computer Fest and there were many sources of
ink refills for the HP and Canon so if you dont like the ink youre using
you have a choice  There is a Frequently Asked Question FAQ list
thats reposted occasionally that reports how to refill the cartridges
yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store
instead of a specialty ink with the specialty price

Im not sure but I think I found another legal source of cheap
hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges
More on that when my mail order succeeds
