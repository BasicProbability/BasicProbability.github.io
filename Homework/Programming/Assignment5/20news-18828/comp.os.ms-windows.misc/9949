Subject 80 col mail messages in MS Windows editors

I have a modest system of aliasesmacros that enables me to download
mail from a public access UNIX system to my MSDOS box I read and reply
to the mail with a MS Windows 31 based editor

Everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message has
maintained his text at 80 col max width Sometimes I get slightly wider
messages that run offscreen so I have to use the cursorslider to read
the whole thing

Im using NDW Deskedit mainly but Ive experienced the same prob with
all other MS WIndows editors Ive fiddled with word wrap settings in
the various editors but to no avail I know Im missing something very
basic in editor setup but what is it

Oh yeah MS Word for Windows converts everything flawlessly but for what
Im looking for thats like using a tank to crack walnuts

Id really like to have an editor setup that would display all incoming
ASCII files in a readable format to my screen

Thanks in advance
