    The key issue that I bought my BJ200 on was ink drying speed  You really 
    have to try awful hard to get the BJ200 ink to smear  The HP DeskJets need 
    1015 seconds to completely dry  In both cases however do not get your 
    pages wet  Unlike laser printers the material on your pages is INK not 
    toner  But that should go without saying

   I think the ink now used in the DeskJet family is waterfast 

Ive had pictures ruined by a few drops of rain These were colour pictures
from a DeskJet 500C Mind you it could have been acid rain

I use a BJ10ex Ink dries fast but it really doesnt like getting wet
