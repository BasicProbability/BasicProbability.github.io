 If I put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys NETX will run but I cant access
 drive f to log in to Novell  
 If I dont put LASTDRIVE  Z in my configsys I cant access other W4WG 
 drives from the filemanager

 It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE  
 statement in my ConfigSys
 
 First off I havent used W4WG but I think thats about to change
 
 The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general and
 in this case NETX in particular adds drives to the device chain 
 Setting LASTDRIVEZ means there are no unassigned as opposed to
 unused drive letters for NetWare to use as it tacks its drive
 mappings onto the end of the existing list of drives  W4WG obviously
 attaches its network drives to existing unused drive letters
 
 Id guess the next thing Id try is something like LASTDRIVEM which on
 most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still
 allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well

W4WG requires DOS drives  I use LASTDRIVEJ which makes my first Novell drive
K and leaves me drives G H I and J for W4WG  My local DOS drives use AF
