2 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager 
    I know CTLESC ESC will do it but Id rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the PM with ALTF1

You might try the recorder and make a micro  I done that to do certain operations 
in a windows app that didnt have the ability to use a micro  It should be in the 
Accessories window  The only problem is that it has to be runing for it to work
But Good Luck
