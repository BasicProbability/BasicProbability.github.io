Subject Mouse Jumpiness Solved

Cant guarantee that itll work for everyone but I finally fixed my mouse
jumpiness problems I installed a bus mouse Sorry I didnt say the solution
was free In the past Id tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse
Cleaning it unloading all kinds of TSRs turning off SMARTDRV write
cacheing changing COM ports  Nothing worked Yesterday I finally broke
down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse The improvement is even better
than I had imagined So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy
all the time I just thought it was jumpy sometimes and I had gotten so
used to it I didnt notice My wife who uses the computer about once a
month noticed the improvement literally within a second

I cant say anything about other bus mice but with the Mouse Systems
one youll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ Also if you
dont know Mouse Systems mice have three buttons The driver includes
a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button

Hope this helps someone else If youre anywhere near as frustrated as I
was its well worth the 80
