Subject Re Ami Pro 30 and PCTools compress Doesnt like being moved


Sorry about that  dont want to alarm anyone

I dont think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools
I reinstalled Ami Pro and ran compress again with no problems
I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had
0 bytes  left while FTPing although I would think it wouldnt
matter since Ami Pro wasnt running at the time and I made space available
immediately anyways
But whatever the cause it is working now
