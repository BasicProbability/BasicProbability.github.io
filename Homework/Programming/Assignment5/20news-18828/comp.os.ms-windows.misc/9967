Subject DOS6W4WG Problem


I am running Windows 31 Windows for Work Groups and just loaded Dos 6

Whats happening appears as a graphics problem with File Manager  Ive
added some menubar buttons but there appears to be a gray boxed region
that covers the top 23rds of the button row  

These buttons are in a row below the pulldown menus  the pulldown menus
look fine and the disk label region looks fine but you only see the bottom
few pixels of the task buttons

Anyone else experience this

Thanks
