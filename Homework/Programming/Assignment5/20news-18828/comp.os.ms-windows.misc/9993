Subject Re Tidying up after removing an OLE server

In article C5y121Kz3liverpoolacuk qq43liverpoolacuk Chris Wooff writes
 A while ago I installed SPSS for Windows as part of an evaluation Once
 the evaluation was complete I duly deleted the software from my PC
 
 Unfortunately there is still a ghost of SPSS left when I run
 something like Write and go to embed an object then SPSS Chart
 appears on the list of objects Im offered I looked around all
 the obvious INI files without success The next thing I tried
 was looking for the string SPSS Chart in every file in the 
 Windows directory It turned up in a file called REQDAT or
 REGDAT Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didnt feel
 inclined to edit it
 
 Id welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers

 You can edit that file with a utility that comes with Windows 31 called
REGEDIT Registration Info Editor
