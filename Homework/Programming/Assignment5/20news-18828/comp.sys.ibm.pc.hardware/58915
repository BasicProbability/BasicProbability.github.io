MG 	I went buying SIMMs recently and the sales person told me that 
the
MG are 9chip SIMMs and 3chip SIMMs and one cannot use them interchan
MG If you use one you have to use all of the same type

dont believe everything you are told  I can tell you that mixing them 
between banks ok and I cant see why mixing in one bank is not unless 
they are of different speeds  eg mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one 
bank   The two only differ in the type of chips it uses  Assuming that 
the SIMMS are 1Mx9  9 bit wide  here is the two equivalent 
configuration  The 3chip SIMM uses two 4bit wide 4Mbit 1M of 4bit 
nibbles  and one 1bit wide 1Mbit chip  for a total of 9bit wide 1Mbyte 
  The 9bit SIMM uses nine 1bit wide 1Mbit chips  These are equivalent 
because of the way that it is pinned on the SIMM board  At the SIMM 
interface they both act as 9bit wide 1MByte SIMMS  24191   sorry 
if too techie for ya


MG 	Similarly one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to 
gi
MG the system a total of 6 MEG Why is that so  If my system supports
MG of 8 MEG it has 8 SIMM slots can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my
MG 16MB 

That sounds correct  the problem is that if your computer takes 9bit 
wide SIMMs you can not mix different sizes in one bank  Why you ask  
Simple  if you understand why there is banks  Assuming you have a 32bit 
CPU  386DX or 486  the data bus eg the mechanism to retrieve data 
from memory  is 32bits wide so the computer expects to see 32 bits when 
it asks for data  To get that bandwidth  32bit wide  the motherboard 
links 4 1Mx9  one bit is not data but parity so I will ignore that in 
this simple explaination  to get 32bits  91432 bits   That means 
that a SIMM in a bank stores only 14 of the 32 bit wide data  If you 
have a 16bit bus two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16bit wide 
data which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide and 32bit banks 
are 4 SIMMs wide  If your computer required 1Mx36  eg 32bit wide data 
with 4 parity bits used in some PS2s and ASTs  you could upgrade by 
one SIMM at a time

Hope that this message is not over your head but the answer to your 
question was not simple  I could of just said because I said so
