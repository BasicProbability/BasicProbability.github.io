KM  Is the 486DX399 anything more than a myth  I havent heard of it
KMfrom any source that I trust and I sure dont see any ads for DX399
KMmachines in Computer Shopper  Intel is pretty busy with the Pentium
KMright now I cant seem them introducing their own competition

I heard the rumor as well but the story differed  Intel was not coming 
out with the tripling clock 486 a clone from IBM was  I got this rumor 
from a pretty good source  Has designs computer equipment and hav never 
been wrong let but there is a first time for everything 

  I can just hear that rumormill turning now
