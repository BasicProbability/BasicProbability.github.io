I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX50 and a 80486DX250
I was wondering although a DX50 is faster because of the path to its
external cache shouldnt the choice be the DX250 as that one can be
made to work properly with a localbus I mean cache speed is one thing
but all your speed will be blocked during video IO so just get that
faster 
Im willing to speculate that the DX250 with localbus will be 24 times 
as fast as the DX50 and probably as expensive or cheap
