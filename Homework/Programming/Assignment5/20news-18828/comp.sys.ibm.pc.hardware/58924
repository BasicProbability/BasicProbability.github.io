I heard the rumor as well but the story differed  Intel was not coming 
out with the tripling clock 486 a clone from IBM was

No rumour IBMs clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last
fall COMDEX or something I wasnt there All you people who are
drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU just like
486SX that Evil Marketing Ploytm from Intel dont you It has 16K
of internal cache which probably is where the saved silicon real
estate went Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its
486 chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become
available in any nonIBM machines Of course nothing prevents other
companies from implementing a DX399 but nobody hasnt even come out
with a real 486DX FPU and all clone yet although AMD soon will
