Subject Quantum ProDrive 80AT drive parameters needed

Hi
I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would
like to format it When trying to format it no lowlevel
format just FDISK and DOS FORMAT I somehow messed up the
parameters I had entered FDISK MBR not exactly knowing
what this does
The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB
I tried type 25 but this gives only around 70MB and not
the nominal 80MB
Could I use user type 47 However I dont know the actual
parameters cylinders heads Could someone give me them
And how does FDISK work together with user type 47
Please reply by email to GERTHDMVSSASCOM
Thank you
Thomas
