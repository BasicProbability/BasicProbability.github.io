I own a Stealth 24 card from diamond  When using the 640X480x167mil win 31
driver the card and driver work but are not very fast  ALL of the other
windows drivers have a number of bugs  Shadows remain when windows are
erased and text boxes are often unreadable  All attempts to get help from
Diamond have failed  I have called the Tech support and never been able
to get past the hold line a toll call in a reasonable time ie 10min
Leaving voice mail has not helped either  The BBS is a joke It always
has too many people on to download anything  You cannot even get a file
listing it considers that a download  I have faxed the tech support group
All this with no reponse

The bottom line is if you are looking for a fast card and want to use it
for windows DO NOT get a Diamond product  Try another vendor I wish I had

While others here may have had better experiences I too share the
sentiments posted above  Though I have the original StealthVRAM
it is only relatively recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use ie will not due to shadowing
misdrawn check boxes etc  I believe the version I have is 201
If theres a more recent release Id appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know  I havent been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again  Naturally Diamond doesnt even bother
notifying me of fixesreleases

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the right person in curing
some of my Windows problems due to an address conflict  The conflicting
addresses 2E0 2E8 were OMITTED in at least my version of the
DiamondVRAM manual  I hope it has been corrected by now  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3based boards use these addresses  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future hopefully with some
form of local bus Ill seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond
