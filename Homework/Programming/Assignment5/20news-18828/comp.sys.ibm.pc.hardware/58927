Subject 8 cards on a 6 card motherboard

This may be the dumbest question of the year but is there a
way to piggyback or expand a 6slot motherboard all 16bit
to get the usual 8  My case has slots for 8 and Id like to
get a scanner but with all my other cards Im already maxd out
Im hoping that a simple solution exists eg an adapter that turns
one slot into three  I dont mind if it turns it into 8bit slots
as I can put my IO card MIDI card and Soundblaster card there
My other cards are 16 bit IDEFloppy SVGA modem

If there is such an expander does that screw up performance of
everything else  Id hate to buy a new motherboard
