Subject Tape Drive Problems

Please reply via email since this is job related 

I have a Colorado Jumbo backup system at one of my places of 
employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool

Is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried Does it simply need 
cleaning

Any and all comments will be appreciated
