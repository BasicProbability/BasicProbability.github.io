Subject Re Gateway 2000 486DX33 too noisy

In article 114152buedu lcaiacs2buedu says

I just received my Gateway 2000 486DX33 minidesktop system
The first thing I noticed when I plugged in the power cord is the
noise that comes from the fan In fact I can hear the noise in

If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive then the noise
is probably coming from there and not from the fan  The Western drives
are notoriously noisy  On the other hand if you dont have a Western
drive then maybe it is the fan  Theres not alot to do about it except
insulate around the cpu somehow
