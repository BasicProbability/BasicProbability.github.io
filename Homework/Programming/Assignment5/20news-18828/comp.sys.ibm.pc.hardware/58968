Subject Re Is 9801MBsec HD transfer slow for 486DX50 EISA with UltraStor24F

Hi I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX50 My computer
configuration is 

486DX50 Mhz 8256 kB EISA Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz
16MB Ram
ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk SCSI
UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller

When I use Norton60 Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer
about 980 kbsec and sometimes 1MBsec Is that good  I thought
that with EISA I could get about 2MBsec 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host 
adapters need to perform a lowlevel format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system do I need that 
A guy I know gets a HD transfer about 12MBsec and he has an ST3283A and
a ISA 486DX50 how can a ISA with the same system be faster 

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk 


1 Dont rely on benchmarks They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs

2 SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card

3 Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster

4 You can disable disconnect and get some kBs but just to loose the mouse
   or other ints when diskaccesing

I get 23MBs with DX50 LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXT340SY  Coretest
I get 13MBs                                               Sysinfo
