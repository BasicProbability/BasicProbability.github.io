        Heres another one

        5  My computer arrived with the following statement in its
            configsys file  STACKS  9256  I changed it to
            STACKS  8128 and saved 1296 bytes  Maybe it could be
            lowered even more but I havent tried it 

Exactly

Regardless of what Microsoft says I have set STACKS00 on every single
computer I have installed Windows on from a simple 386SX16 up to 486DX50
with EISA motherboards NDI Volante TIGA adapters Intel Ethernet Express
cards and caching SCSI controllers from DPT and DTC

Not a problem yet and the extra 2K gained means a lot with conventional
memory gobbling programs like OrCAD and Tango PCB

I remember reading somewhere QEMM manual I think that 
STACK9256 is needed only for the Windows SETUP program  
Otherwise use STACK00

HmmmmmmI got my comp with windows preinstalled and stacks is still
9256  if it was needed only for setup wouldnt the morons take it
off  also I dont have the qemm manual as verything came with the
comp  but not the qemm manual so could anyone verify this
