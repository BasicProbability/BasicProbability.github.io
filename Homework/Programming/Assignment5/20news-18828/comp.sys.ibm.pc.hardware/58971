 I have a gateway2000 48333 local bus system  It has 4 slots for SIMMS
 that either have to use 4 or 16MB simms  My question  I just
 received a 4x9 70ns simm and it has 30 pins  The slot on the
 motherboard has at least 70 or so pins  Did I get the wrong simm
 or can I still use my simm  although not all the pins on the slot would
 be flilled  I have never encountered such a long slot for simms before
 Anyone have suggestions  I cant get a hold of Gateway yet  Thanks
 Please post to the net or    nshahacsbuedu
 
 Yes you got the wrong simm  You need 70 pin simms in 4 or 16 meg
 flavors
