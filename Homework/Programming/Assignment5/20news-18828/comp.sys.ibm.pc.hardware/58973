Subject EPS Technologies experience anyone

After a rough start purchasing a 486 system see earlier post Im trying
again  Im looking at the following system offered by EPS Technologies

 486dx 33mhz w 256K static RAM cacheAMI Bios
 3 32bit VESA local bus slots 3 16bit slots 1 8bit slot
 Teac 12  144 mb floppy drives
 Maxtor 170 MB hard drive 15 ms IDE w64K cache buffer
 32bit vesa local bus video card w 1mb RAM 1024 X 768 NI I think its an
   Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 card
 14 NI Multisync monitor 1024 X 768
 101 Keyboard
 200 Watt power supply
 Windows 31 Mouse DOS 60
 3 years limited warranty
 1 year onsite service

Im probably going to add the 125 for a 15 flatscreen digital monitor and
will also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM 159 extra

Has anyone bought from EPS Technologies particularly a system like the one
Im considering  Im especially interested in their warrantee and service
Can anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages with support
and comparable prices I see FastMicro just bit it
Thanks in advance
