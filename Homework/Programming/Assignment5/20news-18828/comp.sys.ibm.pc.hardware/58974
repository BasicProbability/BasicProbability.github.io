HIGHSPEED  ANALOGDIGITAL PCBOARD

Hello LAdies and Gentleman 

I am looking for a highspeed AD PCBoard with a sampling rate above 250 MHz an a
resolution of 8bit The sampling rate can be arranged by an interleave mode where
the time equivalent sampling yields 2 4 or 8 times higher sampling rate than
the ADConverter uses in non interleave mode

The board must content an ADConverter similar to Analog Devices AD 9028 or 
AD 9038 or if available a faster on

If you a PCBoard 16bit slot ISA with this specification or better please
send me an EMail
