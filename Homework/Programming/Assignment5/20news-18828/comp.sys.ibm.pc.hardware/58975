As most of you know we have recently changed our standard VESA localbus
video card from our own NCRbased card to the new Diamond Stealth 24 VLB card
for packages 2 3 and 4 package 1 still has the NCR screamer  We also have
added the 149 upgrade from the Stealth 24 or NCR to the Diamond Viper to our
product list  Below are the comparisons of the different cards in the
configurations we will offer
