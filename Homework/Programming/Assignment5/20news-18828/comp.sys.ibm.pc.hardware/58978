Can someone please tell me where can I get the best deal for Micronics or AMI
48666 Motherboard with VLBUS  You can reply to me thru email or to this
group 


I purchased a Super Voyager VLB 33Mhz board from Washburn  Company a month ago
I dont have the mailing address Clyde Washburn advertises regularly in PC Week  He can also be reached via CompuServe    The phone number is    
18008368027

I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributersplus I liked  the fact hes a EE that knows what hes talking about
concerning hardware and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  
critcle questions and is very informative to his customers over the phone
