These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points but I will
provide some unsolicited advice  the most amusing kind of advice

Today Tueday 4693 IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems  These systems still have onboard
video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems and
you get VESA Local Bus for future upgrades  We are going to buy three of
them with 17 monitors also a newly available and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and
either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board

Do not buy a 486SX sytem

My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not lossfree  When
you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes  ie they
get you coming and going  Translated this means take infrequent but large
steps  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX
models and go straight to the DX or DX2 models
