Subject Re How much memory for WP for Windows

In article 1ps6pjINNduaravelarcnasagov jkaair77larcnasagov writes
  The documentation says that Wordperfect for windows requires 4 M of ram but
when I try to install it on my laptop I get a not enough memory error message
Ive unloaded everything that I possibly could but still NOT ENOUGH MEMORY
Anyone have any ideas as to why this might be happening 

	Are you sure youre not running Windows in real mode  Is it Windows
31  Do you have a permanent swapfile built
