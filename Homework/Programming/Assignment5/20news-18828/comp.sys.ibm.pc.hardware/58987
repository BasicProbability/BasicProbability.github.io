Subject Upgrade 386SX25 to 386DX40 

Im thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC I am
running Linux as my main OS with a small DOS partition left for my
flatmates games

My current setup is a 386SX25 AMD with 387SX25 ITT  I think and 9
Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS and 120100Mbyte IDE

Basically I have two choices

1 Get a 386DX40  387DX40  or
2 Get some sort of 486

Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high
The first option works out at about pounds 200 486 mboards start at
this price for a SX25

I have a couple of questions

1 How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a
386DXcopro Remember Im using a 32 bit OS and alot of Floating Point
operations

2 How much faster would a 486DX33 be than the 386DX40copro 

Should I get an upgradeable mboard with a 386DX40 and wait for
AMDPentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 

	Any experiences will be most helpful

PS Example prices

	386DX40copro Mboard	270
	486DX33	Mboard		580
