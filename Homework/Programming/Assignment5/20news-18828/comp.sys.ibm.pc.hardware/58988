Subject BOOT PROBLEM with IDE controller

Hi
Ive got a Multi IO card IDE controller  serialparallel
interface and two floppy drives 5 14 3 12 and a
Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it
I was able to format the hard disk but I could not boot from
it I can boot from drive A which disk drive does not matter
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch
the LED of drive A continues to glow and the hard disk is
not accessed at all
I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi Io card
or floppy disk drive settings jumper configuration
Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it
Please reply by email to GERTHDMVSSASCOM
Thanks
Thomas
