Subject Floppy file copying


A silly question I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them
on several floppy diskettes of the same size and format but my computer is
only equipped with one 35 HD drive and one 525 HD drive cant I do the
copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk which is 999 full
using standard MSDOS 50 commands I know
diskcopy a a
works but for small selections of files
xcopy atxt a
does not
Maybe Ill have to write my own file copy command in C but the idea does not
amuse me
Thanks for your help

Francisco
