  there are people who are performance driven enough to do it
  If it werent so people wouldnt buy Pentiumtm systems in the first
  place since they could buy a 486DX399 that would run their existing 
  applications faster  Certainly a 486DX399 is in the same league as
  a Pentiumtm
  
   Is the 486DX399 anything more than a myth  I havent heard of it
 from any source that I trust and I sure dont see any ads for DX399
 machines in Computer Shopper  Intel is pretty busy with the Pentium
 right now I cant seem them introducing their own competition
 

IBM has displayed a 486DX399 as a TECHNOLOGY DEMO

This effectivly means  heres some neat technology It is not
a commitment to make such an item
