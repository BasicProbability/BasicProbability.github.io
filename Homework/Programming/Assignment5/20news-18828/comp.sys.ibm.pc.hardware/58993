So by going mailorder through Gateway I save 13  Plus I get
technical support over the phone free software package

Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone  At least
locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and
he has to fix it
    
How long does he have to take in fixing it  Does he have to use new
parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty
but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part 

When it comes to local dealers

 Have fun getting consistently good support  Most of their techs are
retreaded salesmen not trained technicians with a high turnover rate

 Have fun getting inwarranty work done quickly and courteously

 Have fun getting outofwarranty work done cheaply or even done
period unless you are on a paid service contract

Having been both a service technician and a service manager at a
ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place I know what
Im talking about 

I also know the local service scam that retail computer dealers like
to push when theyre selling  Its that same old song that car dealers
having been singing for years  Buy from me and youll get good
service We always treat our customers right  Buy from my competition
and youll be sorry if you need service 

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service including overnight replacement parts 
onsite calls etc There are probably some local dealers that can give you
good service too But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good 
service you are wrong  I have many anectdotes to prove my point 
but Im sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can
