  It seems that there are using the 16450 UART chip in the
  machine Is that the same as the 16550 UART chip which has a 16bytes
  buffer 
 
    No its not According to the sales critter I spoke with last week 
  though Gateway does use socketed chips You should be able to find the 
  16550AFN for about 15 and upgrade the chip yourself Minor nuisance
 
 For whatever its worth my GW salesman said that their 16450 would do
 144kbps and was soldered to the board 
 
 Will someone with a recent GW pls settle this by inspection

MINE has a 16450 sodered right on the card  Why would you need the 16550
anyway  From what Ive heard when youre multitasking its FIFO buffer keeps
you from loosing data  Is this right
