Subject Application Errors on WIN31


H E L P 

I have  a problem in which Im getting increasing frustrated every day

Some background about my PC

 American Megatrend BIOS clone 386 SX with 32M of RAM
 configsys file

	devicecdoshimemsys
	doshighumb
	devicecwindowsemm386exe noems
	files30
	buffers30
	stack9256

 autoexecbat file is using smartdrvexe c
 CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram

The problem APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL
Run excel no problem A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows

Ok I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 20 No problem with the installation I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexecbatwith the nav running on c
The problem came when I try to bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it  like click a selection with the mouse
from the desktop
First of all I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages The
following are some of them

 Stack fault by TC1024DRV at address 0001XXXX where XXXX is some
  number TC1024DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture
 General protection fault by ndwexe at the same address
 Segment load failure by ndwexe at same address

Some how the address flagged was always 0001something What is address
0001XXXX means 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexecbat no help

Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion Im willing to try
anything
