 I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX50 and a 80486DX250
 I was wondering although a DX50 is faster because of the path to its
 external cache shouldnt the choice be the DX250 as that one can be
 made to work properly with a localbus I mean cache speed is one thing
 but all your speed will be blocked during video IO so just get that
 faster 
 Im willing to speculate that the DX250 with localbus will be 24 times 
 as fast as the DX50 and probably as expensive or cheap 
 
Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a 486DX50 and
a 25MHz local bus

Im waiting for the mezzianine sp VL bus that will be decoupled from
the main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers

This will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard IO
cards Until the next buss spec
