  BKIs it possible to plug in 70ns or 60ns SIMMs into a motherboard saying
  BKwants 80ns simms 
 
  You shouldnt have troubles  I have heard of machines having problems 
  with slower than recommended memory speeds but never faster  
 
 
 It should run without any trouble of course but why do you want to buy some
 60ns and mixed them with 80ns  60ns is more expensive than 80ns and
 furthermore your machine will run the slowest SIMMs clock speed eventhough
 you have 60ns  Just my 002cents thought
 


Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered toCMOS is set to
usually wait states regardless of what speed RAM is installed  No
motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed unless you call
failing as a sort of autosense  This is how you can sometimes use
slower RAM in a machine  You either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow RAM in which case all memory will run at that
slower rate or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you wont crash

Putting faster RAM in wont speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster RAM  

Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus 
slowed down to accomodate slow RAM
