Subject What is a Rapid Tech SQUEEZE card

Hi

I am going through a box of old IBM card and came across one called a 

Rapid Technology SQUEEZE card  It is dated 1990 and has a 54mhz crystal on
it and a big chip that has CCube on it

No connectors to the outside but a ribbontype 50pin connector on the board

It is a 16bit board

Any ideas what it is


Phil
