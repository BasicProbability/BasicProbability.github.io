 Because of some contract IBM is not allowed to sell its
 486 chips to third parties so these chips are unlikely to become
 available in any nonIBM machines 

I saw in this months PC or PC World an ad for computers using IBMs 486SLC
So I dont think IBM is restricted in selling their chips at least not
anymore A clocktripled 486 even without coprocessor would be great
especially with 16k onboard cache Make it 386 pincompatible and you
have the chip upgrade that dreams are made of
