Subject Re Problem with Maxtor 340Mb IDE drive

First of all thanks to those of you who responded both here and via email
The tips didnt pan out but it was good hearing from you

Now following up to my earlier post

 Disk controller  Acculogic sIDE3 2 hard2 floppy IDE controller
   Jumpers  All defaulted shown as   
     Normal IRQdelayed IRQ     Primarysecondary floppy address
     Singledual speed floppy   Primarysecondary IDE address
     Precomp  125ns187 ns     IOCHRDY not drivenIDE drive controls IOCHRDY

 Other cards  didnt check brand 2 Serial1 Parallel adapter
 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter
 	      Roland MPU401compatible MIDI interface 
 		Configured with default IRQ 2 mem address 0330

I opened up the box and removed all the other cards above  No help there
Then not having anything better to try I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed
IRQ on the disk controller didnt make any difference and IOCHRDYnot
driven to IDEdrivecontrolsIOCHRDY also had no effect  So I put 
everything back to the way it was and reinstalled the cards

I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller  Voila
the PC booted from power up although it seemed to take several seconds 
before the first access to the hard disk  Plug the floppy cable back
to the controller and the original nonboot behavior returns

OK with this additional information does anyone in netland have any 
words of wisdom for whats going on and how I should deal with it

Larry still unplugging away Byler
