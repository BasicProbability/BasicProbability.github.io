Subject Re 16Mb ISA limit

markaSSDCSDHARRISCOM Mark Ashley writes

In the latest PC Magazine Pentium isssue there 
is an editorial on the
advantages of a PC using EISEVESALB rather
than just plain ISAVESALB Supposedly users
will eventually want more than 16Mb of RAM
However since the ISA bus has only 24 bits 
then anything on the bus can access only 16Mb
even if I have 32Mb on the motherboard
So far I agree with the arguments

Then the writer claims that glitches can
occur in systems with over 16Mb because 
of that limit That part I dont understand
because the RAM is right on the motherboard
So the cpu should have no problems talking
with the RAM Can anybody explain this 

The problem is with ISA busmasters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory  Busmasters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM
