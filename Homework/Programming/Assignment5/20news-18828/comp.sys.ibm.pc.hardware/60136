  It looks like everything works as advertised but I am disappointed
  with the speed  Im using an Intel 400 internal 144k modem in the PC
  with Telebit 144k on the Unix end which are currently limited to
  192Kbits by the Unix com link To get a quantitative comparison I
  did cat file where file is 20 kbyte uncompressed ascii text and
  it took 75 seconds to scroll through an X window over the modem link
  270 charssec  Using the identical hardware and ProcommFW the same
  cat file takes 11 seconds 1820 charssec  BTW I use NCD PC XView
  on my PC at work HP every day for the same Unix access from a PC over
  a LAN and like that just fine  The same cat file scrolls by in
  2 seconds on the LAN connection

I just tried a few experiments I catd a 20261byte file 471 lines
under various scenarios

PCXview for DOS in a fullscreen OS2 window 1024x768x16    18 sec
Telix DOS in an OS2 window 1024xs768x256                  107 sec
Telix DOS is a fullscreen OS2 window standard VGA        11 sec
Telix DOS in a Windows 31 window 1024x768x256             30 sec
UWWIN in a seamless OS2 window 1024x768x256        gave up after 4 min
UWWIN in Windows 31 1024x768x256           faster but gave up after 2 min
UWWIN in a seamless OS2 window using pg       30 sec could have been a
                                                little faster I had to keep
                                                hitting the space bar

I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card by the way

So PCXview for DOS looks pretty good and the linebyline scrolling
in OS2 desktop looks pathetic although fullpage redraws are pretty
good

I tried it under PCXview using my normal 9x15bold or 10x20 font
and with a very small font and there was no difference in the times
The modem receive light was on pretty solidly so it looks like the
bottleneck was the 9600baud modem not the screen drawing
