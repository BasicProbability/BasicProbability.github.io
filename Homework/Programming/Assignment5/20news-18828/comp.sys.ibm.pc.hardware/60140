 Hi fellow netters
 
 I have a question for you I am gonna buy a 486DX266 MHz
 with VESA LocalBus IS the speed benefit that great  
 Would it be wise to spend on a localbus system HD controller 
 and graphic card for normal use  I mean I wont use it for a
 server  
 
 Also I read an article from someone  sorry I cant remember your
 name  and he said that even though you have a localbus harddisk
 controller your performances wont be that much greater because
 of the disks throughtput  
 So what is the use of having a fast bus if the peripherals cant 
 cope with it 

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for

V for Video  the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two 

How about an VLB ethernet card Move the data into the card at
130 odd MBs and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mbs

 Do do however free the local bus for other cards 

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you dont

 
 Thank you
