 Dont they always Of course theyre so much more expensive than 
 most other quality competitors 

Like who frinstance  When I bought my system November no first second
or third tier vendor could touch the price for the hardwaresoftware
combination I got from GW2000

 Another good thing I have read in the midst of all the Gateway horror
 stories 

If you were selling as many systems as fast as GW2000 youd end up with four
or five pissedoff customers too  And four or five ecstatic ones  And lots
of satisfied ones

 they have an excellent return policy

Dont minimize this if you buy mail order its a good thing to know that
youll get replacements parts no questions asked in a day or two via FedEx

 Theyre very impressive systems when they work

Which they do in the vast majority of cases  Remember that its only the
people on the tails of the curve who are motivated to write  the ones who
love it and the ones who hate it  You dont hear from the folks in the
middle very often

They have rough edges no doubt about it but they give good value per dollar
and use almost all topquality components
