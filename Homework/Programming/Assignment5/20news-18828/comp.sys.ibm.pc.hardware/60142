Is there enough experience out in netland with DOS 60 that anyone could make some comments on whether
or not its a worthwhile upgrade Any problems with hardware compatibility or any bugs been found

One thing I wonder about is the disk doubler included with DOS 60 Is there any possiblity that if
the disk double exe file gets corrupted your disk would be unreadable How would one recover from
such an event

The file that would be a problem is DBLSPACEBIN not EXE
