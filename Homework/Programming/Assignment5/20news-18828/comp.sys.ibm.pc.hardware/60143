This doesnt answer the original question  IS OS2 a multiuser OS
And no mention was made of an ether card either  But from a diskdata
point of view why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi
tasking  Data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive  Can
SCSI find it faster  can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster  Does it have a better cache system  I thought SCSI was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached  If we are
only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive
You are making the same mistake I did you are confusing the DRIVE
interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface  Again from my Mac  IBM info
sheet available by FTP on sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 in the
infomacreport as macibmcompare173txt
Expansion
Both Mac  IBM
SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM
 Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card 
 expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CDROM  Apple developed some 
 specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller 
 specifications which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines  
 Main problem  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM 
SCSI1  7 devices per SCSI controller  8bit asynchronous 15MBs ave
 and synchronous 5MBs max transfer base  16bit SCSI1 requires a
 SCSI2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI2 not wide SCSI2
 which are both 16bit interfaces see SCSI2
SCSI2 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI2 mode  SCSI2 is fully
 SCSI1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI1 since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware which tends to be 
 very expendsive and software  Transfer speeds are 46MBs with 10MBs burst 
 8bit 812MBs with 20MBs burst 16bit and 1520MBs with 40MBs burst
 32bitwide and fast  SCSI2 in SCSI1 mode is limited to 7 devices and
 reduced 8bit or 16bit fast only throughput due to the difference between
 SCSI1 and wide SCSI2 ports

IBM
HD Interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development

IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives Can have more than one hard drive Asynchronous Transfer 5MBs max

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI1 mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode  In full SCSI2 mode
it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI2 comes from  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI2 through put  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI which would reduce its
cost is unwarented and so SCSI is expencive That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost

SCSI2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while
IDE itself limits the through put
