Subject Re Memory Slot Problem

In article 1qiijst27bigbooteWPIEDU ralfwpiWPIEDU Ralph Valentino writes
 I finally decided to upgrade my 48633 EISAs memory from 8 Meg to 16
 Meg  two months after the parts warranty ran out on the Anigma
 motherboard  two months too late  It seems theres a problem with
 one or both of the two 1M2Mx36bit sim slots in bank B  On boot I get
 a pattern test failure at address 0xa00000 and the system deconfigures
 the top 6 Meg  The sims are good I tried rotating all of them into
 bank A  On one of the configurations however the pattern test
 deletions
 failed at 0x800000  In all tests the pattern that appeared was the
 same as the pattern if no sim was in place  This leads me to believe
 the one or two of the connector address pins are at fault and with a
 lot of luck might be patchable
