How about an VLB ethernet card Move the data into the card at
130 odd MBs and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mbs
How about 250MBs for 64bit VLB or 350MBs for QuickRing Apples
implimentation of VLB Byte 1092132 QuickRing is interesting in that
it allows interleaving with other card so that the 350MBs can be divided 
among many cards at the same time NuBus 90 and MCA are about the only card 
interfaces able to DO anything with that kind of speed and even NuBus 90
ditzes around at 30MBs with a burst mode 80MBs
MCA Also called Micro Channel
 IBMs 16 and 32bit bus allows use of more than one CPU in a computer 
 DCT and anything can talk to anything as fast as the two components 
 involved can handle it Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA 
 and EISA  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 Carl Jabido

IDA cant handle VLB speed never mind QuickRingss speed so it is out
EISA pokes along at NuBus Mac II speeds 15MBs burst mode 33MBs
 so VLB and QuickRing are slowed down by it
PCI is a competing interface that is still in development
