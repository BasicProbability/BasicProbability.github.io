Hello
 
I have a question for anyone that may be familiar with ISA and EISA sytem
configurations
 
1  After I switch the ISA boards into the EISA board all of the cards are
ISA the system seems to work with no problem what so ever  But some of the 
interupt problems that we had with the ISA board continue with the EISA board
Is it my understanding that the EISA board should be able to handle IRQ 
conficts when running windows
 
	Problem  When running our network via telnet tcpip with windows
	running the system kicks us out of windows IRQ confict within windows
	I assume
 
Also are there any memory address problems that will happen when the 
boards are switched base memory that is
 
 As far as I know if you are using EISA mother board you have to use also
 EISA cards or else your computer system will be slower than when youre
 using ISA board with ISA cards
 							Bill


Thats nonsense  You can use ISA cards in an EISAsystem without problem
and at the same speed as in an ISA system
