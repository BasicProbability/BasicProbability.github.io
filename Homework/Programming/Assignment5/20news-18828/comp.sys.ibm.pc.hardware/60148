A hard drive with XTtype controller can be added but I recommend not trying a
full height 5 14 hard drive as I have run into trouble with the 635w
supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy platters

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed but it manages
when booting is finished plug in your floppy drive now it will work

ok I know this is not very user friendly maybe you are better off
buying a 48666 with 300 watt power supply or something like that
