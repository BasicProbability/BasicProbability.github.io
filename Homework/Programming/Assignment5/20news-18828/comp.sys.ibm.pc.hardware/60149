I am looking for a way to access the floppy drive at the IO level that
is lower than the BIOS  Given the port assignments what controller
chipspec sheet do I need info on  My floppy is a 144M and I would
also like to be able to write code that works on 360K disks as well
Also with the method of access is it possible to actually read the
individual bytes on the track as they stream into the controller  Im
afraid the sector handling is done purely through hardware

If on the off chance I can get this basic on the access anything to
point me in the right direction would help a lot

there is a file out there look for it with archie that is called
theref22zip which has lots of info on various PC things
amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller
commands I think hard drive controller commands are not there

it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps sector
headers etc   by setting sector size to something very large like
8K
