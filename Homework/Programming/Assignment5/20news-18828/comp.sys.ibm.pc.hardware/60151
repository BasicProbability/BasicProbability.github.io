Subject Western Digital HD info needed

I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Harddrive to the machine  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well and is working fine
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the masterslave
relationship necessary for a c d drive setup

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v33 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 50

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044A circa 5071991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios but it seems to work at a
setting 17 977 cyl 5 head 300 writepre 977 landing zone
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the masterslave  Originally the drive in the machine
had none  Currently I was suggested to try the far right looking at the
back for master and the middle jumper for the slave

When booted the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d drive  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive but then gives the error  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive I
would not even know how to do that

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated  If not a number
for Western Digital might just do as good
