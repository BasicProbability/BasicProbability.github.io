   No buy the serial port and modem Each can be used for other things
 you can use the modem with your next computer might not be a PC or
 upgrade the modem without changing the box I hear that ISDN is big in
 Europe you might be able to get one of those beautiful ISDN modems for
 less than the pice of a car someday 64k bidirectional
