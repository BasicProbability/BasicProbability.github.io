Hi

Can anyone tell me the difference between 30pin and 72pin Simms
I wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two
different types of Simms preferably a magazine review aricle

By the way if there is a FAQ for this group which covers the Simms
information please also direct me to it

Any helpinformation would be very much appreciated
