Subject Tape Backup Question

Hello folks

I have an Archive XL5580 internal QIC80 tape drive which is pretty
comparable to the Colorado Jumbo 250  Since I have two floppy drives in
my system Im using a small card not accelerated made by Archive to 
attach my tape drive as a third floppy device

The problem Although the DOSbased QICstream software works just fine
both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless
I switch the machine to nonturbo speed Im using a 486DX33 EISA  Since
the DOS software works it cant be a hardware problem can it  Has anyone
seen similar problems  Any solutions  Thanks in advance
