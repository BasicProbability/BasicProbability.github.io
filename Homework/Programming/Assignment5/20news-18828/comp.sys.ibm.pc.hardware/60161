Subject tape backup for windows

Im looking for a complete hwsw solution
I need an ISAVLB scsi controller eg Ultrastor 34F
plus a tape drive 500Mb or less like Archive plus a Windows
program that will work on these

My intended system will have 32Mb RAM so
plain ISA controllers will no longer do
But I also hear that the SCSI world
is not very organized

So does anybody have a tape backup setup
like what Im looking for  Please
describe it

Thanks email please
