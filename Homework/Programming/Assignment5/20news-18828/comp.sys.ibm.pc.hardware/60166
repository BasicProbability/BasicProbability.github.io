 I just brought up NCDs PCXView Windows version to use over a 
 modem link to a Unix system at HP Installation is easy but you
 need a program also from NCD called XRemote to run on the Unix host
 Total software cost for one seat was 200

Anyone here know if NCD is doing educational pricing on these software
packages for those of us strapped for cash

Thanks
