Subject WANTED chipset info

I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard  The Last Byte memory manager which
I downloaded for a trial reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset
and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000FFFF which can then be
used for UMBs except for videoBIOS  I would like to write my own driver to
activate the memory  Does anyone know where I can get programming information
on this chip

Phil
