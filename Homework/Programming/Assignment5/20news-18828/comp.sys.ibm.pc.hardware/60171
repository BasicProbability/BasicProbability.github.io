I have definitly seen a
mother board with 2 local bus slots which claimed to be able to
support any CPU including the DX266 and DX50  Can someone throw
some more informed light on this issue

Michael Hamilton

Some motherboards support VL bus and 50DX CPU  There is an option
BIOS I think where additional waits can be added with regard to
CPUVL bus transactions  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives
the VL bus devices time to do their thing  These particular waits
are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus devices  You want to
enable these waits only if you are using a 50DX with VL bus devices

This is from reading my motherboard manual and these are my interpre
tations  Your mileage may vary

Strictly speaking VL and 50mhz are not compatable  And there is at
least one fudge mechanism to physically allow it to work
