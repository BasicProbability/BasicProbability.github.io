Subject Help with fixedfrequency 52kHz VGA monitor

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for 99 that will do
1024x768 noninterlaced which seems like a good deal However it is
a fixedscan rate monitor and only handles 52 kHz horizontal I
think With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62
 not much use since just about any application will set the mode to
something else especially if it wants to do text I suppose Anyway

  is there any way that I can use this as a generalpurpose VGA
   display with a 1meg trident 8900C card

  if not can I do so with some sort of different VGA card
