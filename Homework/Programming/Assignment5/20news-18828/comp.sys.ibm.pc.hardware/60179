Subject Help KA9QEthernet

Dear All

	I am trying to get my standard connection going with KA9Q PA0GRI113016
and a GVC NIC2000 ethernet card I know that my router and modem is
working because I am able to ping finger and even telnetd with it

	However after a time it crashes randomly Help would be
greatly appreciated

	I suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the PC  I am
running with a 386SX33 2 MB Ram  The Ethernet card is configured
for IRQ 5 ports 0x3600x37F 

	Thanks in advance I know that its not much to go on but I
dont even know what the questions to ask are sorry

Please send mail

Elliott
