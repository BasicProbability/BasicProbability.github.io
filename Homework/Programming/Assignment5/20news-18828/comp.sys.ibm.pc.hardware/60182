S There is one param in the bios setup that says AT BUS CLK  I have
clock which is beyond ISA specs but may be ok if all of the cards can 
run that fast  I would set it to 3  in fact I did  and set it back if 
anything acts weird  eg you get unexplainable floppy drive errors your 
modem locks up you have video problems etc   If you overdrive the AT 
bus then that should be the first thing to check if you get an error on 
your system  

It is pretty safe to overdrive your AT bus as long as your ISA cards 
still work flawlessly  I suggest backing up your HD before playing with 
it though

On my 486DX50 really 50 not DX2 my AT bus is set to CLK3

At 1667 MHz I have no problems  Soundblaster Pro Zoom 144 FXM RLL
controller etc  All work fine

If I set it to 2 25 MHz I simply dont get past the POST routines

I doubt you could actually damage much by playing with it
