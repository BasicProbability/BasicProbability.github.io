Subject Need phone number for Western Digital ESDI problem

I have WD1007WA2 ESDI controller with ROM BIOS v11
It has been working fine until I recently upgraded motherboard to 38640MHz
Now my Maxter drive goes crazy making lots of seeking sound even when the
drive is not accessed  Of course with numourous hard disk controller errors
These symptoms disappear when I switch to nonturbo mode 8 MHz
I suspect some timing dependent Rom Bios routines Theres a newer version
2x Could anybody help me on this
By the way my new mother board has AMI Bios 128k Cache 8 MHz bus and
works fine with my old MFM drives I had to dig them up 
Also I will appreciate it very much if somebody send me the phone numbers
tech supportBBS for Western Digital
Many thanks in advance
