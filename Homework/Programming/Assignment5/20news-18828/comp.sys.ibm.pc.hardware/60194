 Hi there

  	I have 1s1p1g  IO card in my 38640 PC 
  When I plug in wang modem at com4it works If I change
  it to com1 it doesnt 
  Program chkport gives diagnostics like possible com irq
  conflict at com1 with mouse driver in memory
 
 Since your IOcard only has one serial port  this should default to COM1  
 Under MSDOS you cant share IRQs  so youll have to set either your modem
 or your mouse to COM2  using different adresses and IRQs
 When you set two devices onto the same IRQ  like COM1 and COM3 or 2 and 4
  the latter one will always win ie if you have your mouse on COM1 and
 start using your modem on COM3 your modem should work  but your mouse will
 stop doing so until reboot
 
 It should be no problem setting your modem to COM2  you didnt write 
 anything about other peripherals 
 
 I hope it helped a bit 					Byte Oli
 
 

Hi

Im kind of new at the pc stuff  My machine has 4 serial ports  Com 1 and3
and 2 4 share same IRQs  You mean I cant plug a mouse into Com1 and a modem
into com3 and expect both to work

If Answer is NO should I change IRQs for com ports to be different  And
does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too
