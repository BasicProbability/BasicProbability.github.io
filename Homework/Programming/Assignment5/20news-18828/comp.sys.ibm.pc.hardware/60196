What does a 200400 meg 5 megssec SCSI drive cost
Since the Quadra is the only Mac able to deal with 5MBs and Hard drives START
at 160MB I have NO idea
For the Mac I have the following These are ALL external
 20MB 299 15MB
 52MB 379 73MB
 80MB 449 563MB
120MB 569639 475533MB
210MB 9791029467490MB
320MB 14991549 468484MB
510MB 19992119 392431MB
etc

So scsi1SCSI2 for the Mac goes down in priceMB as hard drive size goes
up and I assume the same for the PC world

I wont argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OSs when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive
Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface  In the Mac since SCSI is THE
inteface for any noncard nonmodem notkeyboard device the id 7 is used
for the floppy drive called CPU in all identifiers  This allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the OS program CPU SCSI and drive can handle 
itthis shows up best in the Quatra line
In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well
Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers scanners expandsion cards 
this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus Cage CDROM etc
IDE seems to be mainly hard drives  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any
and I cant find any  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface
Make of that what you will
SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE
This alone puts SCSI above IDE  SCSI2 blows IDE out of the water
Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
When the Mac prices came down to Earth so the Rule of Scale still played
and SCSI remained high costcheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end
computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI
off into the statosphere price wise
SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the
standard for the most part  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it
choose SCSI  In 16bit and 32bit mode SCSI is a multitasking OS desined
interface while IDE and 8bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces
at least the way mac use 8bit SCSIUGH
