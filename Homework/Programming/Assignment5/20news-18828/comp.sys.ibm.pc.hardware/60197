In PC Magazine April 27 199329 Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI
20 faster than IDE and support up to 7 devices its acceptance has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches
note what it does NOT site as a factor PRICE
int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI from the
article it seems you get plug and play SCSI1 only since SCSI2 in FULL
implimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices
SCSI1 intergration is sited as another part of the MicroSoft Plug and play
program
