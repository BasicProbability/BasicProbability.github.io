I have the same question as Guido It is possible to use the ESDI drive as a master and the IDE drive as the slave  
At the moment  I have been using the ESDI drive and recently I bought a IDE drive to use as the 2nd drive  
The person in the computer shop told me that it is not possible to run 2 disk controller cards together on the same motherboard  ESDI AND IDE  but I think there might be some way of making them work Can anybody enlighten me on this
And it is possible to  run a ESDI HDD using a IDE controller or vice versa
Can anybody please help me out on this
Your help will be very much appreciated
