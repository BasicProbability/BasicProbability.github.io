Subject FLOPPY DRIVE PROBLEMHELP

Hi

I have a problem with my floppy drives In an effort to make my 35 drive 
normally b my a drive I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial cardfloppyide controller I booted up changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a drive as the 35 and the b drive as the 525
The drive lights didnt come on and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives

I switched the cables back to their original positions and then bootedup and
restored the original CMOS settings The lights for the floppies came on
during this process and they stay on for as long as the computer is on
I see that when there is a disk in a the drive is spinning yet there seems
to be no disk access MSDEXE and Norton SI detect both drives but when I 
try to get detailed information about a or b Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive

Can anyone offer any suggestions
Im in desperate need of help

Thank you for your time
