Subject Help with 24bit mode for ATI

I finally got the vesa driver for my ATI graphics ultra plus 2M  However
when I tried to use this to view under 24bit mode I get lines on the picture
With 16bit or below the picture is fine  Can someone tell me what was wrong
Is it the card or is it the software

Thanks
