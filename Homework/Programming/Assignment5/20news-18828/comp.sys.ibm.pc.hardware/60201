Subject Re IDE vs SCSI

In article 1qlbrlINN7rkdns1NMSUEdu bgrubbdantenmsuedu GRUBB says

In PC Magazine April 27 199329 Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI
20 faster than IDE and support up to 7 devices its acceptance has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches

I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re
performance Where do they get those numbers Ill list the actual
performance ranges which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd

SCSII ranges from 05MBs
SCSIII ranges from 040MBs
IDE ranges from 083MBs
ESDI is always 125MBs although there are some nonstandard versions
