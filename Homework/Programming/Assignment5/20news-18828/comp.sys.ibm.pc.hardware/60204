Subject Re Joystick suggestions


It depends on what youd like your joystick for  Ive seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack  They seemed flimsy and didnt fit well in my
hand  I have heard on csipgames that they dont last well less than
a year on flightsims  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick  There arent any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick 
Im currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron  Works
quite well  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free  The buttons provide good tactile response you can hear
and feel them well  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for 3500 here
compared to the 4500 I paid for a CH Flightstick  I think the extra
1000 is worth it just in feel  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy

Just another note analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch  If youre only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input ie only up
down left etc instead of how much right you might want to look into
a Gravis gamepad  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I dont know
much beyond that
