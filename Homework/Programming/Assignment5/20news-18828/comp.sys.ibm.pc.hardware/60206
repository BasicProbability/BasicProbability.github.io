Can anyone tell me if this card works with the March OS2 21 beta

 I believe so since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very 
reliable in OS2 20

Where do I get OS2 drivers

 Endusers not OEM manufactures will get all the software package with the
card which includes drivers for Novell OS2 Unix  Xenix and so forth

Does this card work with the Toshiba 3401B cdrom in DOS or OS2

 Definitely

Here is my setup
quantam SCSI hd
toshiba 3401B cdrom

Im considering the 542B because I have been told BusLogics support is 
better than Adaptecs and that the 542B performs better than the 1542C
Anyways I just want to know if the 542B will work in OS2  DOS with my
above peripheals

Thank you extremely much for any and all replies
