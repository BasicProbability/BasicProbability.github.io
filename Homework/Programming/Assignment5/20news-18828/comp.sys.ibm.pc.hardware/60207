15401542 SCSI adapter to work with various hardware and software
packages  They are based upon my experiences with an Adaptec 1542A
controller and will hopefully help others  However note that I
cannot guarantee that the following will really help you it works for
me and the information in this document could possibly cause you to

 Windows 31 enhanced mode

     The Windows 31 install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec 1542  However just in case
something went wrong Im going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows 31 working with the 1542  Also you may have noticed
that installing Windows 31 makes your PC run much slower even when
youre not running Windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called Windows 31 runs slowly


 MSDOS configuration

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIGSYS and AUTOEXECBAT files  If you follow the instructions
youll notice that youll need to use doublebuffering with SmartDrive
this is the default setup  Youll also notice that your system runs
much much slower  in both Windows AND MSDOS  See the section
called Windows 31 runs slowly for some ways of speeding your system
up


 Windows configuration

     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows make sure that the
388Enh section of the SYSTEMINI file contains the entry

	VirtualHDIRQOff

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEMINI but Im not sure  If this doesnt work for you you
might want to try adding some more lines

	VirtualHDIRQOff
	SystemROMBreakPointfalse
	EMMExcludeA000CFFF

You probably dont need the above lines though  The
SystemROMBreakPoint entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMM386MAX only needed if you use such programs


 Windows 31 runs slowly

     Once you do get Windows 31 running with the 1542 chances are that
your system is running much slower than before  If its not its
probably because

     1 You happen to be using ASPI4DOSSYS version 31 in your
	CONFIGSYS file  Congratulations  this appears to be a
	winning solution

     2 You are very lucky  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen 

If your system is running much slower than before this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with doublebuffering  According to the
Windows documentation and the Microsoft technical note Q81808
SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOSSYS you must use
Smartdrive with doublebuffering enabled  While this works it really
slows down your PC I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of 5 FIVE  As I consider this unacceptable I looked for other
solutions

     Unfortunately you cannot just disable doublebuffering  If you
do Windows 31 in enhanced mode will not work and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 31
What you can do is one of the following

     1 Use other drivers that provide doublebuffering  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient doublebuffering or by a bug in
	Smartdrive

     2 Use a driver that provides VDS services VDS stands for
	Virtual DMA Services  This is a standard which is supported
	by Windows 31 that allows busmastering disk controllers like
	the 1542 to work with Windows

     After trashing my hard disk countless times I found the following
solutions none of which require using Smartdrive note however that I
am now getting occasional parity errors which are probably NOT caused
by these solutions but might be  see below  While the following
does not require Smartdrive using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended as this makes Windows run much much faster

1 If you do not have the ASPI4DOSSYS driver or you do not need ASPI
   functions for controlling a CDROM tape drive more than two
   physical hard disks etc you can add the SCSIHASYS driver to your
   CONFIGSYS file eg

	DRIVERcSCSIHASYS V386

   Windows needs the V386 option  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory it cannot be loaded into high memory and it occupies
   about 1620K  As of November 1992 the SCSIHASYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at 4089457727 hopefully its
   still there

2 If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOSSYS driver version
   30 or 30a you can use both the ASPI4DOSSYS and SCSIHASYS drivers
   in your CONFIGSYS file eg

	DRIVERcASPI4DOSSYS
	DRIVERcSCSIHASYS V386

   Amazingly enough the SCSIHASYS driver can also be loaded high
   assuming you have DOS 50 I would have thought that this would
   crash my system but it doesnt  I asked Adaptecs technical support
   about this and they said that loading SCSIHASYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPI4DOSSYS is loaded LOW

   On my system NOT using SCSIHASYS with ASPI4DOS 30a would
   occasionally cause Windows 31 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows with the additional result of a corrupted disk some of my
   CWINDOWSGRP files would be corrupted  For me these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMANEXE
   the default Windows shell and viceversa  This is the reason
   SCSIHASYS may be necessary

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHASYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPI4DOS earlier than 30

   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 30 or 30a without
   SCSIHASYS they do not seem to have any problems at all  I consider
   these people lucky  Others like me have had all sorts of problems

3 In my opinion the best but not necessarily the easiest solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 31  The SCSIHASYS driver is no longer
   needed  Unfortunately while you could get previous ASPI4DOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS the ASPI4DOS 31 driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS  As far as I know there are only
   three ways to get a copy

       You can buy the new as of November 1992 Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 31 as well as other
	drivers such as CDROM drivers  I believe the list price is
	around 75

       If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around 30

       A copy of ASPI4DOS 31 is included in Central Point PC Tools 80
	for MSDOS  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is
	included the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPI4DOS 31

Note however that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows  In all probability defective hardware in my PC is causing
this as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions  However because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses there is a very small but definite possibility that the
parity errors are driverrelated for example changing the bus onoff
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this  Ive run various
memory tests for hours at a time and these tests have found no
problems  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements which cause parity errors during disk transfers
this is why the memory tests didnt find any problems  the problems
show up only under disk IO  However Im mentioning this just in case
it isnt a hardware problem


 Floppycontrollerbased tape backup devices

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a
floppycontrollerbased tape backup device such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 250

1 Tape backupsrestores can take a very long time  The tape drive
   constantly starts stops starts stops etc

2 Tape operations may be erratic or encounter too many tape errors
   This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542
   However Ive heard of other people having similar problems and so
   Im mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   1542


 Tape backupsrestores take a long time

     If you have a floppycontrollerbased tape backup device you may
have to adjust the Adaptec 15401542 bus onoff timing for best
results when using the tape drive  Normally while doing a tape backup
or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously running with
only an occasional pause  However the default bus timing on the
Adaptec 15401542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop
start and stop every few seconds  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive however note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this  make sure your tape heads are clean
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much much longer
than necessary

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory tofrom the tape drive and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory tofrom the hard disk  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA the tape drive stops
rewinds a bit and restarts once enough data is eventually fed to it
The default bus timing on the Adaptec which is really DMA timing is
too large  For example when a backup is done data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory and then from memory to the
tape  Because the default timing on the Adaptec hogs the memory too
much too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive  As a result the tape drive constantly starts and stops
because data is not fed to it quickly enough

     The solution is to change the Adaptecs bus onoff timing  The
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on and 5 microseconds off
The bus on timing needs to be lowered to 24 microseconds  This can
be done in one of two ways

 If you have ASPI4DOS you can use the n option  For example I use
  a bus on timing of 4 microseconds which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIGSYS file

	DEVICEcaspi4dossys n4

  Note that there is NO space between the n and the 4

 If you dont have ASPI4DOS your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called SETSCSIEXE which is very difficult to find  The
  reason is that Adaptec for reasons of their own does not seem to
  want this widely distributed  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec and they asked me to not upload it anywhere  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it  If you do find a copy you run it like so

	setscsi n4

  This adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds  Running
  SETSCSIEXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSIEXE if you use
  ASPI4DOS SETSCSIEXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded  I
  could use SETSCSIEXE with SCSIHASYS however

Do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds or increase it
above 11 microseconds  If you lower it too low the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower  For me 4
microseconds works fine  This value may work fine for you or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little

     Once youve lowered the bus on timing tape backups and restores
should run faster

     Also do not experiment with the bus onoff times with the other
options that I have intentionally not described unless you know what
you are doing  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse by
starving memory refresh

     A program called BUSTIFIXEXE exists on the Adaptec BBS  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked which has been a while
this is a selfextracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus onoff times for the 15401542 and others  However when I tried
running this program with my 1542A my system crashed  At the time I
was running SCSIHASYS and I didnt check to see if there was a
conflict with it  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B
although the docs say that it works with the 1542A


 Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors

     This problem may or may not exist  Although it existed on my
system a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it
However Ive heard of other people having similar problems and so Im
mentioning this just in case it isnt a hardware problem just on my
1542

     Symptoms of this problem which persists even after cleaning the
tape head

1 Backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors
   resulting in an aborted tape backup

2 Tape backup works but the tape compare fails

3 The tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much too often
   Unlike the abovementioned problem Tape backupsrestores take a
   long time where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds
   this kind of startingstopping occurs every few 1020 seconds or so

4 Fastback Plus 31 does not findsee any tape backup devices  Other
   programs like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive can findsee the
   tape drive but Fastback Plus 31 cannot

5 Too many tape read errors

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it  A few months ago I
upgraded my motherboard which contained an integrated floppy
controller  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542 I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller  After a while I
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard  When I did this the tape drive a CMS Jumbo 250
reliability increased dramatically and Fastback Plus 31 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive

     I dont know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542
On the one hand the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542 which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542  On the other hand the tape drive didnt work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller but it did work when attached to a different
controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542  I did change floppy drive cables and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables  I dont know what the cause really is
however if youre having similar problems you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller


 Sound cards

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound and
this is typically done using DMA  Like the tape drive DMA the
Adaptecs DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA  Unlike that of the
tape DMA this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error
your system crashes with a parity error message  What happens is
that data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough which causes a
parity error  Usually getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware

     Ive found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity eg higher sampling rate recording in stereo
recording using 16bits instead of 8 etc

     Like the tape drive solution the solution here is to lower the
Adaptecs bus on timing  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done  Note however that this may or may
not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem ie some software is inefficient  Disk caches the
speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this


 Miscellaneous info

     This section contains miscellaneous hints tips and rumors  Much
of it is merely information that Ive heard or read about and have not
verified  I believe that the following information is correct but Im
not sure  Use it at your own risk

 With QEMM 600 601 and 602 you need to specify the DB
  parameter eg DB2 unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver
  If you dont QEMM will crashhang at bootup  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line at least this occurred with the QEMM 600 install
  program  I havent tested any other version  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter but Im not sure Ive never used a
  version earlier than 600

  If you use ASPI4DOS you do not need to give QEMM the DB parameter

 Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec  Im not sure if this is
  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec

 To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542 you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  nonSCSI these drives cannot be used with the 1542  You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work or even if they work  the following is secondhand
  information

     1 You can buy Adaptecs EZ SCSI driver package which lists for
	something like 75  If you already have older Adaptec drivers
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around 30  Contact
	Adaptec for details  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need

     2 You can buy the CorelSCSI driver package which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW  This package contains CDROM
	drivers SCSI tape drivers WORM drivers etc  I do not know
	the list price but Ive seen this package sold for around
	8090  Note that CorelSCSI does not come with the ASPI4DOS
	driver which is needed  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS
	you may be better off getting Adaptecs EZ SCSI instead

     3 This method is obsolete as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptecs EZ SCSI kit but Im mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW1410 kit ASPI4DOS and the ASW410
	kit ASPI CDROM drivers  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEXEXE a highlevel CDROM driver if it is not included in
	the ASW410 kit but this is available from several bulletin
	boards

 To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542 you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive  Software that Ive heard about are
  again like the above section on CDROM drives I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work or even if they work  the
  following is secondhand information

     1 Central Point PC Tools 80 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives  It comes with SCSI drivers
	ASPI4DOS 31 as well as Central Point Backup

     2 The CorelSCSI driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details  However note that CorelSCSI does not come with but
	requires ASPI4DOS

 Ive seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations

     1 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS
     2 1542 SCSI controller wBIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers
     3 1542 SCSI controller wBIOS Adaptec ASPI drivers and
	CorelSCSI driversprograms

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration

     4 1542 SCSI controller wBIOS and EZ SCSI drivers including ASPI
	drivers

 Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver you
  need this driver before you can use this program  Ive never used
  this version of GNU tar but Ive heard that it works I dont know
  how well though  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet
  a copy can be found on wsmrsimtel20armymil and mirror sites

	PD1MSDOSDSKUTL
	ASPIBINZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives Adaptec 154xx
	ASPIPATZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 110
	ASPISRCZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve UNIXFORUM might
  have it if any forum does

 As far as MSDOS is concerned the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are
  the same with MSDOS the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B
  However the hardware for these two boards is not 100 identical and
  there is at least one NONMSDOS program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A but did work with a 1542B BSD386  a 386 version of
  BSD Unix

 In case anyones curious heres an edited copy of my CONFIGSYS file

	FILES40
	BUFFERS40
	BREAKON
	STACKS10256
	DEVICEcsysdevaspi4dossys d n4
	DEVICECQEMMQEMM386SYS on RAM ROM DMA32 STM XF800FFFF
	DOSHIGHUMB
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevnnansisys
	DEVICEHIGHCDOSSETVEREXE
	shell  cdoscommandcom p

  Note that Im using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 31  If I were using ASPI4DOS
  30 or 30a Id probably have to use a CONFIGSYS that looked like

	FILES40
	BUFFERS40
	BREAKON
	STACKS10256
	DEVICEcsysdevaspi4dossys d n4
	DEVICECQEMMQEMM386SYS on RAM ROM DMA32 STM XF800FFFF
	DOSHIGHUMB
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevscsihasys V386
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevnnansisys
	DEVICEHIGHCDOSSETVEREXE
	shell  cdoscommandcom p

  If I werent using ASPI4DOS Id probably use something that looked
  like

	FILES40
	BUFFERS40
	BREAKON
	STACKS10256
	DEVICEcsysdevscsihasys V386
	DEVICECQEMMQEMM386SYS on RAM ROM DB32 DMA32 STM XF800FFFF
	DOSHIGHUMB
	DEVICEHIGHcsysdevnnansisys
	DEVICEHIGHCDOSSETVEREXE
	shell  cdoscommandcom p

  However if I used a floppycontrollerbased tape drive or if I
  planned to record highquality sound from a sound card I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptecs bus onoff times  The first
  two versions of CONFIGSYS take care of this but this last version
  doesnt
