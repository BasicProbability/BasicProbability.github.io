Subject Re Western Digital HD info needed

My Western Digital also has three sets of pins on the back I am using it with
another hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right 
on the circuit board of the WD driveMA SL 

I cant remember what the last one was If you cant find these markings on the
circuit board Ill open my machine and tell you what mine are
