Everybody DOS 6 users in particular take note  if you want to play games
that hateuse their own upper memory manager DOS 6 is not a problem  No
boot disks required  As your system starts up hit the F5 key  This tells
it to bypass config and autoexec altogether  You get a plain generic session
of DOS with nothing loaded  theres another function key that actually
steps thru configsys asking if you want to execute each line but Ive
forgotten it at the momentyou can try finding it  I think its F9

     No you need not bypass the configsys in Dos 60 there is a function 
of multiconfig have you tried BOOTSYS  the multiconfig is the kind that 
you can choose you configsys at the startup And I find that is very good 
It has no conflict to QEMM I have problem when using BOOTSYS
    The key you say is F8 which is trace the configsys step by step
    Sorry if any error
