Gday All

I was looking to build a Parallel Port Digital to Analogue Converter the other
day and came across this schematic which I promptly threw together on a piece
of VeroBoard

     P25


Please excuse the obvious limits of the Lower ASCII char set 

I have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey ABS box

Unfortunately I cant get it to work I have a little demo here by the name
of Cronologia Which the schematic came from and all I can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hashstatic with a small amount of music signal
behind it  its even worse than the speaker inside the machine

Does anybody out in netcolourfulcomputerworld have any ideassuggestions
better designsimprovementswastepaper bin etc

Many thanks for a reply via this conference or email

  
X  Regards Jason
