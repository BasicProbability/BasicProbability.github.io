Subject Booting from B drive

I have a 5 14 drive as drive A  How can I make the system boot from
my 3 12 B drive  Optimally the computer would be able to boot
from either A or B checking them in order for a bootable disk  But
if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that
it cant boot 5 14 disks thats OK  Also bootb wont do the trick
for me

Thanks
