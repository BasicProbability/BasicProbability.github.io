my home Viewsonic 6  I like the Multisyncs because its easy to run them
in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced or at higher modes like
1360x1024x16
Oh yeah I just got my new Eizo Flexscan yesterday to replace my old 8515 and
I tried it with 1360x1024 This mode is just great I can get four perfectly readable
command windows on the screen And if I need more colors I can go back to 1024x768
or even 800x600
One thing I am wondering though Why isnt there a MONxxxxDGS file which contains
ALL the resolutions up to 1360x1024 Now I have to change the XGASETUPPRO every
time I want to switch instead of simply going through the system settings of OS2
