 I would like to hear the netwisdom and netopinions on IDE Controllers
 I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard
 What are good options for this preferably under 200 It MUST also work
 under OS2 and be compatible with Stacker and other Disk Compression SW

I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller although my machine is
DX266 VLB I has the save transfer rate of 0647 MBs regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed I tested it with speed between
55MHz and 833MHz Not any difference The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory

My advice Buy 4Megs of RAM save 70 and enjoy performance
