Subject An 8051 simulator  is example code available

Hello world
 
Im attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching
purposes so that firstyear eleceng students can see the workings
of the microcontroller as it performs operations  logical ands for
example being shown on a bitbybit basis 1 AND 1  1 so that the
students can see that its not really a mystical process but totally
logical for example Every instruction should show some working
and not just alter registermemoryport contents
 
Does anyone know of any freelyavailable example simulation code
in Pascal or Modula2 that would show me where Im going wrong
in writing my simulator Im using Ayalas The 8051 Microcontroller
as a reference  the simulator supplied with the package is overkill
for simple teaching purposes I feel and theres no source code to help
you roll your own
 
Please email me if you can help or if you know of somewhere more 
appropriate I should be posting this   I rarely scan these groups
 
Thanks
