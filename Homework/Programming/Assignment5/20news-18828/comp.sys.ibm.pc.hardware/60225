Subject Apple hard disk drive


	Just wanted to ask a question I bought a hard disk drive secondhand
the other day and I opened the packaging up and saw that there was a small
sticker on the drive that had a little red apple with a bite taken out of it
Its socket did not look the same as my existing hard disk that is in my
computer already it has fifty little pins sticking out from it instead of
the 39 that is sticking out of my old hard disk
I dont know if disk drives for the Apple or Mac are different from ones
used in AT clones so could someone tell me if I could use this hard disk
on my AT clone If not what did I just purchase Its a Quantum Prodrive
Its dated 1988 on the green board Will I need a controlleraddin card
All the help is much appreciated Thanks
