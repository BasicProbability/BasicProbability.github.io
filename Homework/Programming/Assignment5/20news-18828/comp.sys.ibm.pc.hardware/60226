Hi

I just disassembled my old XT and get 2 disk drives  30M hard drive and a 
360K floppy drive  My questions are

 can I use these 2 drives as drives D  E on my 386SX25   This 386SX25
  currently has 80M hard drive 12M  144M floppy drives

 if I can what sw or hw do I need 


I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors I bet your 386SX has IDE drives The
two are not compatible on the same controller However you might be
able to use the drive with its controller in your 386SX You should be
able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller I
think You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT
