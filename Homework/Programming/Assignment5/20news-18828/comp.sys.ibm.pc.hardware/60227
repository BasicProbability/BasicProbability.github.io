Subject What video board for my system

Id appreciate any advice about a video card for my system

48633 DX 16 mb of ram
on a Novell 311 network
Monitor  NEC 4FGe capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations

I expect I will work mostly in windows but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS  I do mostly word
processing database and communicationsnot much intensive graphics

With a 15 monitor I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256
colors seems plenty but Id like like the image to be sharp fast
and rock solid

Other considerations

I sometimes run a Unix clone Coherent and I understand that some
companies eg Diamond dont encourage the thirdparty
development of drivers

I might move to OS2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking

I dont have a local bus motherboardIm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well

If you have any advice for me Id love to hear it via email or post

Thanks
