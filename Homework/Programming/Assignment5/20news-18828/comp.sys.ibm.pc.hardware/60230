I started a similar thread about a month ago and got many replies
The summary

CTX 14 Nasty low quality Avoid

CTX 15 Proscan Not as good as some other makes however cheap
  Main problem seems poor quality control Some reported pincushioning
  the problem I had others poor focus etc etc

I complained about mine and it was retuned I dodnt even pay
shipping and returned to me in 2 days 

Its now clear wellfocussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all Im very happy with it and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice Certainly a Trinitron
say would be much nicer but thats well out of my price range

Conclusion If youre on a budget get one and be prepared to
send it back if its not perfect It probably wont be when you get it
but has good potential
