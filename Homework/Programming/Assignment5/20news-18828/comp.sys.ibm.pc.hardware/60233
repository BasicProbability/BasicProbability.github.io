 What about VLB and a 486dx50   Does the local bus still run at 33Mhz or does
 it try to run at 50Mhz

Hi
VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz
and 2 cards by 40MHz

there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLBSlots
s Ct 992 1092 1192

50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design

Better OSs OS2  iX are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM
if you use EISABus
Has someone experience with VLB 
I think of SCSIVLBBusmaster The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller which is unable to reach more than 16MB
