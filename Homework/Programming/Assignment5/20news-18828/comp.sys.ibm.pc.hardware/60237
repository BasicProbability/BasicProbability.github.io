Subject Re Choosing an appropriate Power SupplyPLEASE HELP


In a previous article lopescogsciucsdedu alann lopes says


The problem is that I recently had an HD go bad and
someone suggested that it may have been because of
an inadequate Power Supply  How does one know
what kind of wattage is necessary to run two large
Maxtors 12 and 660

I am not an expert My understanding is the watts output of the power 
supply must exceed the sum of the hard disk watts requirement

Typically a 200W power supply is sufficient to power a PC

Hope this help
