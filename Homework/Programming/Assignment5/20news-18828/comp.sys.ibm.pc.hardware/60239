Subject Q which of these CDROM players would you choose for OS2


Netters

I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought Why not ask
the netcommunity I was ordering a Nec CDR74 but saw so much cheaper
ones that I want to know more
The drive will be used to install software and if available for listening
to CDs Perhaps some day Ill want to use it to read the other CDs but
thats not really relevant at the moment

Ive been offered the following CDROM players for the prices stated
They all claim to have SCSII and operate under OS2
The drives are not listed in the cdromfaq and therefor please give
your opinions on the drives ive got the impression that theyre not
all SCSI Actually the Nec was listed as nonscsi in the cdromfaq and as
a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq

Ive calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2 Its actually
about times 18

Mitsumi CRMC     240
Philips LMSI    300
Philips 205      350
Toshiba         370
Nec CDR74       650

Who bought that Trantor that is in the faq Its extremely cheap and SCSI
so whats the trick or where can I order it Holland using MasterCard

Trantor T128     200
