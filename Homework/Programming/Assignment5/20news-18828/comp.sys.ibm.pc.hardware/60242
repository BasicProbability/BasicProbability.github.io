Basically Im looking for a 15 SVGA 1024x768 noninterlaced
monitor  The NEC 4FG is the one most of the computer mags use as
their standard and from what Ive seen and heard it looks pretty
good but its a bit expensive 700 bucks is the best deal Ive seen
So I thought perhaps I might find something as good for less  Any
recommendations  I also thought about the NEC 3FGx which has the
same specs as the 4FG except for the scan frequency which is more
limited anybody have any comments on this one  Would it work with

I believe that NEC is replacing the 4FG and 3FGx with 4FGe and 3FGe
models reportedly being released at the end of this month  Im
waiting for a 4FGe the main difference being a 3 year warranty and
higher refresh rates at the higher resolutions  It sounded from a PC
Magazine note that the 3FGe was being boosted in a number of ways
Call the NEC 800 number and have them send you info

I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now  Several others here 
also have this monitor  We have had no problems  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 
MHz viz 50 Mhz  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me but you might feel differently  Finally speaking of 
spending money with the size of todays files etc a tape backup is 
certainly worth 200300  Recently I set up a friends PC 50Mhz and VESA 
local bus  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost
