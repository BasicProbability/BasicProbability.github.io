 Im looking to buy a 17 monitor soon and it seems that I cant decide what
 monitor I should buy I have a MAG 17S this is a 25 dpi version and it using
 a TRINITON tube and a NANAO 560i in mind

Good luck finding an MX17S  When I was looking around back in
DecemberJanuary Mag wasnt producing any because they couldnt get
tubes from Sony  I asked when they expected to restart production as
I was willing to wait a few months to get an MX17S but they said not
any time soon  I wound up getting a T560i and am extremely happy with
it
