 I would like to hear the netwisdom and netopinions on IDE Controllers
 I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard
 What are good options for this preferably under 200 It MUST also work
 under OS2 and be compatible with Stacker and other Disk Compression SW

I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller although my machine is
DX266 VLB I has the save transfer rate of 0647 MBs regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed I tested it with speed between
55MHz and 833MHz Not any difference The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory

My advice Buy 4Megs of RAM save 70 and enjoy performance

Computer 28625 mhz
Bus ISA 125 mhz
Drive Maxtor 7213A 213 mb

                                    configsys  autoexecbat

                     MS DOS 5             no           WIN 31
                     smartdrvsys        cache         smartdrvexe

CORE V 27         6950 ksec          1390 ksec     1395 ksec
Norton SI V 50     730 ksec           980 ksec      982 ksec

Id still like to here from people with VLBIDE
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives
I still want to know if some most  IDE drives can handle bus speeds  8 mhz

PS A friend with a 28620 and a new Maxtor 7245 245 meg IDE drive gets
between 800  1000 ksec cant remember exactly  I think the bus is running
at 8 mhz in this case
