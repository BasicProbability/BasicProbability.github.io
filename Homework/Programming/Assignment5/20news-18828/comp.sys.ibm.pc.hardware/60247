SCSII ranges from 05MBs
SCSIII ranges from 040MBs
IDE ranges from 083MBs                                       
ESDI is always 125MBs although there are some nonstandard versions
The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI
SCSII 8bit asynchronous 15MBs ave synchronous 5MBs max transfer 
base
SCSI1faster this requires a SCSI2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI2 8bit to 16bit speeds with SCSI1 controlers
SCSI2 46MBs with 10MBs burst8bit 812MBs with 20MBs burst 16bit 
and 1520MBs with 40MBs burst32bitwide and fast  16bit SCSI can be
wide or fast it depends on how the port is designedThe Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI1 nonwide port

The article in PC Mag 4279329 was talking about SCSI1 SCSI2 uses
TEN 10 devices in it native mode outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI1 7 devices slower through put

From your own figures SCSI1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for 20 faster then IDE that seems to be 8bit SCSI1 using a SCSI2 
contoler chip The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI2 controler chip for its SCSI1
and gets 6MBs through put for asynchronous 8bit SCSI1 far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI1 output 120 of 83 is 996 which is near
the burst of a SCSI1 machine with a SCSI2 controller chip

The PC world seems to have SCSI1 and SCSI2 mixed up  Fact is SCSI2 
controler chips allow near SCSI2 speeds through a SCSI1 device
As shown in the Mac Quadra which skews some of the data of SCSI1 vs
IDE or ESDI test I agree that the article COULD have stated that the 20
faster then IDE came off a SCSI1 device with a SCSI2 chip  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI1 NOT SCSI2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI1 device
with a SCSI2 controller chip
SCSI1 chips are limited to 5MB max  SCSI1 devices with SCSI2 chips
becoming common produce up to 10Mbs in 8bit mode and 20MBs in 16bit
mode the fast version SCSI1 ports cannot use wide SCSI  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI1 devices HAVE SCSI2 chips
or more accurately the machine does This allows the best of BOTH
worlds high SCSI2 speeds and cheeper SCSI1 costs FULL SCSI2 hardware
port electronic controller etc is VERY expensive  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI1 goes

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about while  DXB132psuvmpsuedu is throwing out
ranges that dont tell SQUAT Since he IGNORES SCSI1 devices with
SCSI2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended
