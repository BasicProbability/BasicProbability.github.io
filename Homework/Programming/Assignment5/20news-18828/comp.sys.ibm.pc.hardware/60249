In article 1qlbrlINN7rkdns1NMSUEdu bgrubbdantenmsuedu GRUBB says
In PC Magazine April 27 199329 Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI
20 faster than IDE and support up to 7 devices its acceptance has   
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches
                                                                      
I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re      
performance Where do they get those numbers Ill list the actual
performance ranges which should convince anyone that such a               
statement is absurd                                                     
SCSII ranges from 05MBs                                                
SCSIII ranges from 040MBs            
IDE ranges from 083MBs                          
ESDI is always 125MBs although there are some nonstandard versions
ALL this shows is that YOU dont know much about SCSI

SCSI1 with a SCSI1 controler chip range is indeed 05MBs
and that is ALL you have right about SCSI
SCSI1 With a SCSI2 controller chip 46MBs with 10MBs burst 8bit
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI1
 so it DOES exist Some PC use this set up too
SCSI2 8bitSCSI1 mode          46MBs with 10MBs burst
SCSI2 16bitwide or fast mode  812MBs with 20MBs burst
SCSI2 32bitwide AND fast     1520MBs with 40MBs burst
 
By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct
With a SCSI2 controller chip SCSI1 can reach 10MBs which is indeed
20 faster than IDE 120 of 83 is 996 ALL these SCSI facts have been
posted to this newsgroup in my Mac  IBM info sheet available by FTP on 
sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 in the infomacreport as 
macibmcompareversion txt It should be 173 but 161 may still be there

Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI2 chip
an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI1 chip Not at a 6MBs
10MBs burst it does not SCSI1 is 5MBs maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER  It seems that Mac and IBM see
SCSI1 interface and think SCSI1 when it maybe a SCSI1 interface driven
in the machine by a SCSi2 controller chip in 8bit mode Which is MUCH
FASTER then true SCSI1 can go

Dont slam an article because you dont understand what is going on
One reference for the Quadras SCSI2 controller chip is
