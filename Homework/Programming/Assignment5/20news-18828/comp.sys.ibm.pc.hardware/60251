I have a 5 14 drive as drive A  How can I make the system boot from
my 3 12 B drive  Optimally the computer would be able to boot
from either A or B checking them in order for a bootable disk  But
if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that
it cant boot 5 14 disks thats OK  Also bootb wont do the trick
for me

Thanks

	You can try to get into the setup byt pressing CTRLALTINS or 
	CTRLALTPrintScreen on most PCs That should give you an option
	to set regarding the drives to boot from
