Subject No 32bit box on Gateway

While playing around with my Gateway 2000 localbus machine last
night it became apparent that Windows 31 didnt give the option
for 32bit access for virtual memory

I am using a permanent swap file and the disk drive is on the local
bus interface

Is this expected or should I be investigating further why no 32bit
option appears

Thanks for any help
