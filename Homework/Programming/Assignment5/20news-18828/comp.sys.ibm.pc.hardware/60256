Subject Tandberg 3600  Future Domain TMC1660  Seagate ST21M problem

I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600  Future
Domain TMC1660  Seagate ST21M MFM controller 

The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system
and of course no SCSI devices found I have no other SCSI devices

The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the
system The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on
the SCSI bus The system then of course stops booting because my MFM
hard disks cant be found

The system hangs if all three Tandberg Future Domain TMC1660 
Seagate MFM controller are in the system 

Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future
Domain card But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg
is connected

I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses IRQ  IO
port Have I missed anything

I am lost here Any suggestions are most welcomed Thanks in advance
