I have a Logitech 2S2f or 2f2S 2button mouse that I want to
interface to a serial port of a different nonibmcompatible system
The mouse is XTATPS2 compatible with a DB25 connector  I tried
to reverse engineer the mouse but it has a microcontroller inside
it

If I could get the DB25 pinout and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines
that support it I could map all this into my target system

Anyone know where I might get the pinout or the BIOS routines
Are the routines published someplace convenient

Thanks
Silvio
