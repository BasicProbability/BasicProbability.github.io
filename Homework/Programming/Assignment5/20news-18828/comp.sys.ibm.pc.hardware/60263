Subject Help  Installing old HD on older Compaq XT

We are trying to install a donated hard disk Miniscribe
vintage 1988 on a supercheap ancient Compaq XT for
use in education  The only problem is that the
supercheap Compaq didnt come with the manual and I
havent been able to figure out how to start the SETUP
program

I began using PCs after 286s were invented so I have
a couple of basic questions

1  Did XTclass computers even have SETUP programs

2  If they did or do how do I access it

If anybody has any good advice on how to proceed or
what to do next or what to look out for please let me
know  Email is best but Ill also be watching the
newsgroup postings

Thanks in advance
Robert
