    Oh yeah I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a
    high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitorsthe Sony
    1604S for example and this is where the extra cost comes from  It
    is also where the high bandwidth comes from and the fantastic
    image and the large image size etc etc
 
 Its also where the two annoying lines across the screen one a third
 down the other two thirds down come from
 

The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube these
2 wires will be found on all 17 trinitron tubes eg Mitsubishi 17
Sony 1604 etc  On 14 Sony tubes youll find one wire

Their level of annoyance is purely subjective  Im so happy with the
sharpness of the T560i that I dont even notice the lines

The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which when viewed as a complete tube
has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube  This results in 
a flatter screen than other 17 monitors using the standard trinitron 
which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus
