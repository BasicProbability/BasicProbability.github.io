Subject SWITCH 35 TO A

Hi

Id like to switch my floppy drives so that my 35 b drive becomes a while
my 525 a becomes b Im having a few problems though

I know that the ribbon cable must be switched as well as the CMOS settings 
to reflect this change and I think that Ive done that correctly However the
drives do not operate correctly in this configuration From the C prompt if 
I type a the 525 drive light comes on if I type b both the light for the
525 and 35 drives come on

There are some jumpers on each drive
525  Label   Original Pos   Pos I changed it to
        DS0      ON               OFF
	DS1	 OFF		  ON
	DS2	 ON		  ON
	DS3	 OFF		  OFF
	IO	 OFF		  OFF
	MS1	 OFF		  OFF
	DR	 ON 		  ON
	MS2	 ON		  ON
	FG	 OFF		  OFF

35    DS0	 OFF		  ON
	DS1	 ON		  OFF
	DS2	 OFF		  OFF
	DS3	 OFF		  OFF
	MM	 ON		  ON
	DC	 ON		  ON
	MD	 OFF		  OFF
	TTLCMO8 ON		  ON


Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance
