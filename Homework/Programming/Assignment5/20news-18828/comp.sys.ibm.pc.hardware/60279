Subject  Help me select a Backup Solution


Hi Netters

Im looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution  After you read about
my situation Id like your opinion  Heres the scenario

1  There are two computers in the house  One is a small 286 40MB IDE drive
    The other is a 386DX 213 SCSI drive w Adaptec 1522 controller  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup  
    restore program  Both systems have 35 and 525 floppies

2  The computers are not networked nor will they be anytime soon

From what I have seen so far there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions Im sure there are others I havent thought about  For these 
options I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws drive type X wont coexist with device Y etc in my thinking 
I dont know very much about these beasts

1  Put 288MB floppy drives or a combination drive on each system
    Can someone supply cost and brand information  Whats a good brand
    What do the floppies themselves cost


2  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and
    continue to back up the 286 with floppies  Again can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories  Any
    happy or unhappy users I know about the compression controversy
 

3  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter and
    maybe connect it to the 286 somehow any suggestions


4  Install a Floptical drive in each machine  Again any gotchas or 
    recommendations for manufacturers  

I appreciate your help  You may either post or send me email  I will
summarize all responses for the net

Thanks

George
