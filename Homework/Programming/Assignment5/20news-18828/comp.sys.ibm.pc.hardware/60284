   64k of 25ns SRAM

 By my way of thinking Michael how could this memory be static RAM if it
 has a speed rating  I didnt think SRAM needed a refresh time

 Doesnt that make it fast DRAM

This chip would take 25ns to return valid data after being issued an address

Refresh time none for SRAM as you pointed out is a different parameter
and is not generally referred to except by motherboard designers

 Cheers
 Ben
