Subject Adaptec ASW410 and Sony CDU641

About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW410 driver for use with a
CDROM drive  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I
had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with
CDROM drives  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a
major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
I think its called EZISCSI or something  I wasnt too fussed about this
until I upgraded by CDROM drive from a Sony CDU541 to a Sony CDU641  I now
find that the audiomode will not work  I assume it is not being handled
correctly by the ASW410 driver

So should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade  If so does anyone know their
FAX number

Any assistance appreciated

Regards

BTW everything else works fine certainly seems that Sony have caught up with
     the rest with the 641
