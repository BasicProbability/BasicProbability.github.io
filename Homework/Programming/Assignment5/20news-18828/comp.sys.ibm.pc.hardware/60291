Subject A DRIVE WONT BOOT

Hi

I recently switched my 35 drive to A The problem is while I can read and
write to both the new A and B correctly I cant boot from a floppy in A
Ive checked the CMOS settings it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot 
Order AC 

Once I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A I got a
message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive It didnt work
When I do have a systems disk in the A drive this is what happens
1 Poweron and Memory Test
2 A light comes on
3 B light comes on followed by a short beep
4 HD light comes on for an instant
5 B light comes on again then nothing happens

The light goes off there is no disk activity of any kind and the screen 
blanks I cant even use ctrlaltdel

Any suggestions

Thanks in advance
