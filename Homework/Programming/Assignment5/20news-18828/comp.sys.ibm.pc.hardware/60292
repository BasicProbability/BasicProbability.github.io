Anybody seen the date get stuck

Im running MSDOS 50 with a menu system alive all the time  The machine
is left running all the time

Suddenly the date no longer rolls over  The time is reasonably accurate
allways but we have to change the date by hand every morning  This involves
exiting the menu system to get to DOS

Anyone have the slightest idea why this should be  Even a clue as to whether
the hardware battery CMOS or DOS is broken

Ive started to notice the same thing myself Im running DOS 5 and Win 31 so
I can fix it from the Windows Control Panel At times it is the date at
others the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should
be

If you find out Id like to know also Oh and I also leave my system running
all the time
