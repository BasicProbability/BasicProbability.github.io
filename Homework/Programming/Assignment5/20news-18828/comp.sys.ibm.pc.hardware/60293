Subject HELP Installing second IDE drive

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive a Seagate 210MB
I can look up the model number if its important and Ive been
trying to help him install it  Ive got a vested interest since
my machines busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed
He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD again I forget the model number
but I can find out

Anyway I cant seem to get the bloody thing up  Ive managed to get
one or the other drive up with the other disconnected but not both
at the same time whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup 
never gets past the system test  The IDE controllers instruction
sheet says it supports two drives I think Ive configured the CMOS
correctly the powers plugged in properly I even learned about the
masterslave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have didnt
know PCs were into SM 8 and I think I configured the jumpers
properly the 85MB one is the master the new 210MB one is the slave

The only thing I can think of is maybe Im doing the cabling wrong  Ive
tried several combinations

controller  master  slave
controller  slave  master
master  controller  slave

None of them worked  Unfortunately I cant think of any others

Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C drive and D
drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others
Ive seen  Could this be confusing things

So I need HELP  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some
info for the CMOS setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card I cannibalized the cable its one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so
it looks like a serial connection now I be lost

Many many thanks in advance  This is practically an emergency I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday  Help
