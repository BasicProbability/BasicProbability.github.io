In PC Magazine April 27 199329 Although SCSI is twice as fasst as ESDI
20 faster than IDE and support up to 7 devices its acceptance has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches

I love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re
performance Where do they get those numbers Ill list the actual
performance ranges which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd
SCSII ranges from 05MBs
SCSIII ranges from 040MBs
IDE ranges from 083MBs
ESDI is always 125MBs although there are some nonstandard versions

By your OWN data the Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI is correct

How is 040 twice 125 Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes
the statment correct
Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE I include SCSI and ATA are
completely different ESDI is devicelevel like MFMRLL


With a SCSI2 controller chip SCSI1 can reach 10MBs which is indeed
20 faster than IDE 120 of 83 is 996 ALL these SCSI facts have been

Great you can compare two numbers ATA has several speed modes by the
way but what the article said was misleadingwrong

posted to this newsgroup in my Mac  IBM info sheet available by FTP on
sumexaimstanfordedu 364406 in the infomacreport as
macibmcompareversion txt It should be 173 but 161 may still be there

I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs
if they are really interested in this stuff


Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI2 chip
an Apple salesperson said it uses a fast SCSI1 chip Not at a 6MBs
10MBs burst it does not SCSI1 is 5MBs maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER  It seems that Mac and IBM see

Something is missing there  Anyway I agree Theres a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like SCSI2 compliant which tells
you nothing about the performance whether it has WIDE support etc

One reference for the Quadras SCSI2 controller chip is
Digital Review Oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p81

What does it use Hopefully a good NCR chip eg 53c710
