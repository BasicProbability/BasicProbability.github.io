Subject Re 17 Monitors


I have a Sony 1604S 17 monitor and I dont see any lines across
the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode
But because of the hor lines and poping that I do see and hear
when I am usinf 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 modes and switch back
to anything of less I would not buy another Sony at what ever price
Oh ya this is I guess a 15 viewing area It dont impress me one bit   Sam
