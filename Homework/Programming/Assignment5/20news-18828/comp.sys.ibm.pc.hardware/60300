 I have an old 3Com ethernet card PC AT Bus that came out of a Apollo
 workstation Im trying to identify it in order to use it on a PC
 
 The Assembly number is 400800 REV 2 and it is a 16 bit card circa
 1985  It has an AUI port as well as a BNC coax connection  It has
 selectable address for the BIOS IO DMA and IRQ locations via berg
 jumpers  It also appears to have a Intel 80186 processor on board
 presumably for buffering 
 
 The ethernet chip appears to be an Intel 82586 a 48 pin DIP package Is
 this chip an equivalent to the 8390 used in some cards There is also
 a 68 pin PLCC chip called a LINK
 
 Please  email as I dont think this is of general interest

My least favorite last line of a post  Um it is of general interest
As I prepare to retire 22 Apollos myself Im looking for ways to 
recycle the useful parts
