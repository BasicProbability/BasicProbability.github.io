I would also like an explanation of this If anyone can explain
why the SB Pro and LPT 1 can share an IRQ please do so

I think its simply because DOS doesnt use the IRQ for anything OS2 does
so with that you cant share the IRQ

That is correct  in DOS you can use IRQ 7 for your SBYou cant do
that under OS2 because it uses IRQ 7 for the printer
