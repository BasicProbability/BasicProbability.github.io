   Oh yeah I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a
   high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitorsthe Sony
   1604S for example and this is where the extra cost comes from  It
   is also where the high bandwidth comes from and the fantastic
   image and the large image size etc etc

Its also where the two annoying lines across the screen one a third
down the other two thirds down come from

Annoying Are you actually using one or are you just talking 

Im sitting in from of one right now and I must say I never notice them Yes
of course I can see them if I look but annoying NO WAY
