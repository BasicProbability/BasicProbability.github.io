Better OSs OS2  iX are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM
if you use EISABus
Has someone experience with VLB 
I think of SCSIVLBBusmaster The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller which is unable to reach more than 16MB

I dont think FD is a problem  Since FD is much sloooooooowwwwwwer
than HD the overhead of double buffering doesnt matter
