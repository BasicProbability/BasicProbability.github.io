   Hello my question is could someone Email me the names of manufactures
of the 16550 and predecsor UARTs   I have only seen them refered to by
number however i would like to find a technical manual for these ICs

  any where i can find out the technical specs for these UARTs would be
appreciated prefereably the 16450 as well as the 16550 however one will do

I suggest that you go direct to the original and preferredbest quality
source for all of this just as you would at least should for the chips
themselves  National Semiconductor  you can reach them at 18002729959
they no longer package the data sheets in a book as they did when I got
mine but you can get them as individual sets of data sheets  you want as
a minimum the following

    2 sets of data sheets
       NS16450INS8250ANS16C450INS82C50A
       NS16550AF

    2 application notes yes GET THESE
       AN491 The NS16550A UART Design and Application Considerations
       AN493 A Comparison of the INS8250 NS16450 and NS16550AF Series
         of UARTs

both of the application notes I listed have proven to be AT LEAST as
valuable as the data sheets themselves more actually  AN491 in
particular is an exceptionally wellwritten application note that goes
into detail about how and why the 16550 does what it does and how best
to take advantage of it

btw they send these out free as long as you dont abuse it

later
