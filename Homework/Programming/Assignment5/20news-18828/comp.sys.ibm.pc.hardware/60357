 point of view why does SCSI have an advantage when it comes to multi
 tasking  Data is data and it could be anywhere on the drive  Can
 SCSI find it faster  can it get it off the drive and into the computer
 faster  Does it have a better cache system  I thought SCSI was good at
 managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached  If we are
 only talking about a single drive explain why SCSI is inherently
 faster at managing data from a hard drive

 IDE  Integrated Device Electronics 
  currently the most common standard and is mainly used for medium sized 
  drives Can have more than one hard drive Asynchronous Transfer 5MBs max

 Why dont you start with the specsheet of the ISA bus first
 You can quote SCSI specs till youre blue in the face but if they
 exceed the ISA bus capability then whats the point

Who said ISA was necessary  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth
investing thousands of dollars eg a new pcs worth of money  in 

 Who says IDE is limited to 5 megssec  What about VLBIDE  Does anyone
 know how they perform

You didnt read to carefully  VLBIDE uses the same connection mechanism
as standard IDE  If transfer rate is limited by IDE whether its
interfaced to ISA EISA or VLB matters not

 So at its LOWEST setting SCSI2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI1 mode AVERAGES 
 the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode  In full SCSI2 mode
 it blows poor IDE out the window down the street and into the garbage can
 As implimented on what system  

On mine for one thing  SCSI blows IDE out of the water hands down  If
IDE has better throughput why isnt it used on workstations and file
servers  

 The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
 rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI2 comes from  NOT
 the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
 SCSI2 through put  

 Given the original question SCSI used only as a single hard drive
 controller  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
 at least 5 maybe 10 megssec for the SCSI choice to make any sence
 What does a 200400 meg 5 megssec SCSI drive cost

No thats the nice thing  on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drives
at once  Ive got unix loaded on one of my pcs along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time  Its pretty ugly

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home  I paid 369 for it  I
havent seen IDE drives cheaper

 The original CGA cart back in 84 was 300  I think the original EGA card
 or PGA was 800  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
 in price mainly because were talking about PCs and not Suns or Sparc
 or SGI or name your favorite unix workstation  That is after millions
 of PC buying decisions over the years SCSI has had plenty of time to
 come down in price

No actually were talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC  If they had a common read
easily implemented method of adding scsi to a PC like as in a Sun or
Mac then youd find SCSI the connection medium of choice

 I wont argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
 data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
 than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OSs when
 managing data from a single SCSI hard drive

On a single drive SCSI is more expensive  But you bought your PC for
expandibility so youd want to add more drives or whatever  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE

A partial list
	1  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently
	2  A SCSI device works on many different machines I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI  hook them up and away they go
	3  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices  For
	instance recently I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor
	212 meg IDE  The connor MUST be setup as the slave  It will
	work no other way  On SCSI you set the address check the
	termination plug it in and away it goes
	4  I have a problem with IDEs mutual exclusion  I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c
	to d on a SCSI system  Under a multitasking OS this is very
	noticable as many things can be going on at once

One neat thing that Ive noticed lately a fringe benefit has been the
ability to add older almost dead drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem  weve got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that Ive
added to my PC  Ive now got the interface full but it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives 1 240 meg drive 1 tape drive and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card  

Simply put SCSI is handier than IDE  No mysterious jumpers to figure out
