From lynnvax1mankatomsusedu

If anyone out there can help I would greatly appreciate it

This christmas I built a computer out of used parts for my Fatherinlaw
The disk drive that I installed was a Seagate 2511 MFM  Anyway he now he
would like to put another HD into this system  I DONT want to buy another
MFM the only reason why I used an MFM in the first place is that it was
FREE  Would I need a special IDE HD controller  Also if I do need a 
special IDE controller where can I purchase one  how much are they

Please send any responses to
