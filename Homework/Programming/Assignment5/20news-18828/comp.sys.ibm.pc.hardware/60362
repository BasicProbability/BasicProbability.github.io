From michaelpcmithrksse Michael Thurbin

I have a Connerdisk model CP30061G 200Mb  with no info at all The only thing I know is that
is normally used with Compaqmachines
Please send me information on switchsettings geometry and so on
It looks like a normal IDEdisk but is it possible to use it with a standard IDEcontroller
