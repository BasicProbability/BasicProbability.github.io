Subject Looking for replacement for a JVCdisk
From michaelpcmithrksse Michael Thurbin

Hi
I got hold of an old Zenith 286 Laptop with model ZWL18345

The harddisk is dead but the rest seems to work I took the Zenith apart and found a very strange
disk for wich I now try to replace

The disk is marked JVC model JD3824R001
Has anyone any specs on this disk or suggestion where i can find it or a cheap replacement for it

Thanks for your help

 Michael
