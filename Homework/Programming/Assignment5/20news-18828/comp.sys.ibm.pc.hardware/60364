Subject Re S3 video card at different address

Id like to add a second S3 based video card to my system  Does anyone
know of a company that sells a card that can coexist with another one
All I really need is color text on one monitor and fast color graphics
on the other

Probably just a configurable address would do it


For what its worth I havent confirmed it a Diamond techrep told
me that ALL S3based video cards use port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8
If this is true it appears that you canNOT use more than one S3 card
in your system
