Subject Turbomodem Complete Pc question


	Im trying to transfer some software between two machines 
	and Im having real trouble  My own Intel 144k 
	v32v32bisv42v42bis works fineI just talk to it
	at 56k and everything comes out clear  This other modem
	at the other machine is a Turbomodem from The 
	Complete PC the machines are in seperate houses 
	so a direct serial link is impossible and copying this
	much data to disk is a paineasier to turn the machines
	on for a few hours and go see a movieno this is not
	pirated software

	I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up  It will
	dial and connect just fineat 9600 baud  But if I try to
	set the comm at 19k2 384k or 56kbps the stupid thing
	connects but just gives garbage it connects 144k  
	His machine a dx48633 has a 16550AFN UART so thats
	not the problem

	It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to 	
	a comm program at 14400bps even though it will take
	dialing instructions at 56k and respond OK etc to 
	other commands  I dont have a comm program that can
	do precisely 144k  

	I looked at the manual but it was unclear  All I know is
	I didnt have this trouble with the Intelit came
	ready to connect this way  Do I need to initialize it
	any way in particular

	Also its using V42bis and V42 and MNP5 when connecting
	here ie at 9600 since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far
	but it doesnt say so there  any ideas

	BTW  I tried the initialization string that I use for
	my modem but it just gives ERROR on that one
