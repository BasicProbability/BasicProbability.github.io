Subject IDEESDI coexistence

Hello all

You the Net are my last resort or Ill just change my job 
This might be a FAQ eg mixing controllers but havent seen any

Sys 48633 AMI BIOS and your runofthe mill multiIO card with
serialsparalfloppies and 
	 IDE controller clone Gw2760EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller  
	 Quantum ProDrive LPS 3 105M type 47 755cyl 16hds 17spt

Pb I want to bring in this 2nd hand neat price
	 Maxtor XTB380E 330M 15ms BIOS type 1 ctrller manages
		the real geom 1630cyl 8hds 52spt
	 Western Digital WD1007VSE1 ESDI ctrller no floppies
		jumpers set IRQ 1415 hw port addr 1F0170
		and BIOS addr CC00C800 and other floppyformat stuff

Goal have the WD ESDI as a secondarycontroller and have both disks 
simultaneously working Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected

Ultimate goal have room for Linux et al
Ex of scheme I have in mind boot from IDE HD or floppy and mount
the ESDI as root Not booting from ESDI or even from HD is acceptable

I have tried numerous all combinations to no avail They work alone
or can coexist witout hangups but cant access the ESDI or the IDE 
depending on setupjumpers

Useful suggestions might be
 How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st
 Do I need some driver to make it work
    some new BIOSchip for any of these cards
 do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy IDE
is cheaper ESDI is hard to find and rather costly Im not 
rich or I wouldnt try to scavenge around so soft slns are preferred
 adapters of some sort I can hold a soldering iron and can change
a chip or put a jumper

Also useful
 BBS or Hotline of Western Digital
 ftp archives with relevant info
 expert stores in Toronto Ontario area that would be a miracle havent
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while
 any hints into inner workings of the system  
 anything else that helped you in similar situations prayers  

Direct or posted replies are ok
	Many thanks
