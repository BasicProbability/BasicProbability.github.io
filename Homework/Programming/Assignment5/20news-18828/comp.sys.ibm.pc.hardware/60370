 Im thinking about getting a Toshiba 3401 CDROM and hooking it up
 through the SCSI port on a Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum sound board
 Does anybody have this configuration out there  If so does it work
 
 For anybody in general who has the Toshiba 3401 CDROM drive have you
 had any hadware problems  Door not opening scratched disks door not
 closing getting stuck or not closing all the way CD holder jamming
 and any other CD related problems

	I have one and it is my favorite CDROM drive so far  I also have 
a NEC74 and have had experience with several other drives Various 
Phillips drives

	The 3401 is faster than the NEC I like its door better the NEC 
needs 2 hands the XA handling The NEC needs to be rebooted to go from 
XA to ROM while the 3401 does it on the fly All in all I am seriously 
considering replacing my NEC with another Toshiba
