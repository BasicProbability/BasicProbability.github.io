 I have an old 3Com ethernet card PC AT Bus that came out of a Apollo
 workstation Im trying to identify it in order to use it on a PC
 
 The Assembly number is 400800 REV 2 and it is a 16 bit card circa
 1985  It has an AUI port as well as a BNC coax connection  It has
 selectable address for the BIOS IO DMA and IRQ locations via berg
 jumpers  It also appears to have a Intel 80186 processor on board
 presumably for buffering 
 
 The ethernet chip appears to be an Intel 82586 a 48 pin DIP package Is
 this chip an equivalent to the 8390 used in some cards There is also
 a 68 pin PLCC chip called a LINK

I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap too Their Assy
numbers were not 4000series but your description fits otherwise They
are 3Com 3C505s aka Etherlink Plus cards Check out ftp3comcom there
are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com
cards I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic
program for 3C505 succesfully passes with flying colours 

Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS2
