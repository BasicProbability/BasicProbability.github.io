Once in a while you have to put in a good word for something that works
well  I have had no problems with my Toshiba 3401  It works very well with
DOS and OS2  For OS2 you dont need to load any special drivers  The
installation will detect that it is a Toshiba drive and you are done

BTW its also very fast
