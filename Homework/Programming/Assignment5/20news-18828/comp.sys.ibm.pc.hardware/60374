 I wont argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good well implimented
 data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
 than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OSs when
 managing data from a single SCSI hard drive

I have been following this thread and figured Id throw in my two cents

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus 716 vs 833 MHZ

	Except for the fact that its superior in just about every way to
the ISA Bus

The Amiga has had a preemptative multitasking  OS since 85 and can
operate with 1 MB RAM  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems

	Except for the new systems that now ship only with IDE controllers
