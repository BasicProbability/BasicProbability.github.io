Subject pcjunior usable

My fiance has a pcjunior and wants to upgrade to a full 386  Does anyone
know if we could use the monitor it came with on a new machine  I heard
its MCGA or EGA but not sure which  Also does it use cards so we can 
use the drive controller floppy etc

Thanks for the help
Bryan
