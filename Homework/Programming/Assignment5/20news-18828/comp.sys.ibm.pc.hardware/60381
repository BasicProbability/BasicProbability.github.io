Subject Re IDE vs SCSI

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home  I paid 369 for it  I
havent seen IDE drives cheaper

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for 320  thats 245
million bytes or 234 megabytes  With the basic 20 interface he gets
close to 1 megsec transfer on his 28620  Does your figure include a few
hundred  for SCSI drivers
Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI1 for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB

But on that point is it faster  This is what all this is about  Do you
get more performance for the money
Ok once again with the SCSI spec list
SCSI1 with a SCSI1 controler chip synchronous range is indeed 05MBs
 asynchronous range is slower at 03MBs
SCSI1 With a SCSI2 controller chip 46MBs with 10MBs burst 8bit
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI1
 so it DOES exist Some PCs use this set up too

SCSI2 8bitSCSI1 mode          46MBs with 10MBs burst
for those who want SCSI2 but dont want to pay for the 16bit or 32bit
 hardware or mess with the SCSI2 software controllers  Usable by SCSI1
 devices with close to 8bit SCSI2 speeds
SCSI2 16bitwide or fast mode  812MBs with 20MBs burst
SCSI2 32bitwide AND fast     1520MBs with 40MBs burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132psuvmpsuedu speak
IDE ranges from 083MBs                          
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
 Range 05MBs
ESDI is always 125MBs although there are some nonstandard versions

One problem is the inconsitant use of the term SCSI in articles and by
people  Its PROPER meaning is The set of SCSI interfaces composed of
SCSI1 AND SCSI2
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote
My comments in 

PC Magazine April 27 199329 Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI
This is asynchronous SCSI1 with a SCSI1 chip 20 faster than IDE
this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI1 with a SCSI2 chip AND 8bit SCSI2
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read
asynchronous SCSI1 with a SCSI1 chip
Although asynchronous SCSI1 is twice as fast as ESDI one third the 
speed of IDE
or asynchronous SCSI1 with a SCSI2 chip or 8bit SCSI2
Although SCSI1 with a SCSI2 chip and 8bit SCSI2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI 20 faster than IDE

NOTE the NONUSE of SCSI by itself  This eliminates ambaguity

SCSI1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16bit and 32bit SCSI2 drivers 
are VERY expansive 8bit SCSI2 can use SCSI1 drivers with little speed
degridationthe Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI1 or SCSI2 or SCSI over all SCSI1 AND SCSI2
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE
