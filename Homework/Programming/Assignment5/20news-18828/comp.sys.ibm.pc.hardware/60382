My fiance has a pcjunior and wants to upgrade to a full 386  Does anyone
know if we could use the monitor it came with on a new machine  I heard
its MCGA or EGA but not sure which  Also does it use cards so we can 
use the drive controller floppy etc

The only things youll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
and monitor  The floppies are 360k and the monitor is CGA but you will need
an adaptor cable to use it  The junior does not use standard cards  Unless 
youre really strapped for cash you should just junk the thing and buy new 
stuff
