Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI1 for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB

What group is this  This is not a MAC group

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list

Why the spec list again  We are talking SCSI on a PC not on a MAC or
a UNIX box  And we are talking ISA bus or possibly EISA or VLB

This isint compperiphsSCSI
Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC
with an ISA or EISA or VLB bus

Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate  Im sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the 40 megssec of SCSI xyz widenfast but the PC isint one of
them

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI1 or SCSI2 or SCSI over all SCSI1 AND SCSI2
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE

Well maybe if the SCSI design people had their act together than maybe
all PCs would have built in SCSI ports by now
