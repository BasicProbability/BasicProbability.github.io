Can anyone tell me if this card works with the March OS2 21 beta

 I believe so since the Buslogic cards have proven to be very 
reliable in OS2 20

The BusLogic cards have an OS2 20 driver that does work with the March 21
beta Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS2 20 any longer
If you wish to install the beta from the CDROM you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS2 attempts to use them Thanks Adaptec 

So you add the BusLogic drivers to the configsys on the CDROM boot disk and
REM out the Adaptec drivers

Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta and it wont work IBM
nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again Thanks IBM So REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more and reboot If you have everything in the
right order it will work

Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation except OS2
will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end so you
are off to more REM statements and more fun 

The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers The DOS drivers work great This card can easily be
configured to work with 8 different sets of IO ports and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine If you get a new card it will also be
able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS

Hope this helps
