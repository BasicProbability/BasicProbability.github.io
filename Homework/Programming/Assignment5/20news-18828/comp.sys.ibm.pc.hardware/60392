Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI1 for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB
What group is this  This is not a MAC group
Nice of you to DELETE BOTH YOUR responce and the item that prompted it
to whit
I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home  I paid 369 for it  I
                                      
havent seen IDE drives cheaper
To which YOU responded
A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for 320  thats 245
million bytes or 234 megabytes  With the basic 20 interface he gets
close to 1 megsec transfer on his 28620  Does your figure include a few
hundred  for SCSI drivers
To which I correctly pointed out the following                         
Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI1 for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB
As I said this is sloppy and DUMB YOU should resounded by DISCOUNTING the Mac
NOT giving Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for 320 example  By giving an
example you give the IMPLIED consent that for MAC info to be INCLUDED
in the SCSI discusion

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list
Why the spec list again  We are talking SCSI on a PC not on a MAC or
a UNIX box  And we are talking ISA bus or possibly EISA or VLB
Ok I will do this V E R Y  S L O W L Y so you can understand
REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI1 and SCSI2 are DIFFERENT
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI1  All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS Lumping them all together as SCSI is
dumb and sloppy  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem 
in the PC world The spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were
coming from in the article  It shows the article is CORRECT in it
staments about SCSI but not CONSITANT

This isint compperiphsSCSI
With the way this thread has gone how do you tell 
Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC
with an ISA or EISA or VLB bus
Already GAVE them  YOU keep deleting them So here are the Specs
on everybody AGAIN With some added info

SCSI1 SCSI1 controler chip asynchronous range 03MBs
 synchronous range 05MBs  Both common to the PC world difference is
 mainly in software not hardware

SCSI1 SCSI2 controller chip also called SCSI2 8bit 46MBs with 
10MBs burst  This is advertised as SCSI2 in BYTE 493159 FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDSNOT the Mac the PC

I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC
SCSI2 16bitwide or fast mode  812MBs with 20MBs burst
SCSI2 32bitwide AND fast     1520MBs with 40MBs burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132psuvmpsuedu speak
IDE ranges from 083MBs                          
 asynchronous range 05MBs infered from BYTE 493159
 synchronous range 083MBs
ESDI is always 125MBs although there are some nonstandard versions

Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate  Im sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the 40 megssec of SCSI xyz widenfast but the PC isint one of
them
Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI2 which holds true
a Mac OR IBMPC clone with the correct hardware and software
And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY 
CANNOT WE

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI1 or SCSI2 or SCSI over all SCSI1 AND SCSI2
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE

Well maybe if the SCSI design people had their act together than maybe
all PCs would have built in SCSI ports by now
With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT Like YOU
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote 
My comments in 
Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDIThis is asynchronous SCSI1 with
a SCSI1 chip 20 faster than IDE this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI1 with 
a SCSI2 chip AND 8bit SCSI2 PC Magazine April 27 199329
The ARTICLE is confused NOT SCSI  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess

SCSI means The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI1 AND SCSI2
NOT SCSI1 as some people want to use it

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read
asynchronous SCSI1 with a SCSI1 chip
Although asynchronous SCSI1 is twice as fast as ESDI one third the 
speed of IDE
or asynchronous SCSI1 with a SCSI2 chip or 8bit SCSI2
Although SCSI1 with a SCSI2 chip and 8bit SCSI2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI 20 faster than IDE

NOTE the NONUSE of SCSI by itself  This eliminates ambaguity

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI1 or SCSI2 or SCSI over all SCSI1 AND SCSI2  Lumping
everything into SCSI as SCSI1 is SLOPPY WRONG and DUMB  Inconsitant
SCSI1 and SCSI2 usage is also a problem  Clean it up now or have
a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle
slapped SCSA an their own monitor inteface SCSI IS standarized unlike
SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology
