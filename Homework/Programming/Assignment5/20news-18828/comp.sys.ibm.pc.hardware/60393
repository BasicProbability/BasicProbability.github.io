 Problem Occasionaly the machine freezes At least thats what I thought but
 recently I discovered that the machine works just the keyboard freezes and
 the clock drops down from turbo 33Mhz to standard 16Mhz mode

 Perhaps you hit the S Control S  Try Q
 I know it doesnt explain the clock rate drop

We had the same problem in our company We changed the keyboardbios and
after that everything went fine Our dealer told us that some boards of
that series have a defect kbdbios
