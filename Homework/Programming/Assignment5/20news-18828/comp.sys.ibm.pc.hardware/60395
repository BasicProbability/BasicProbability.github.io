 Im kind of new at the pc stuff  My machine has 4 serial ports  Com 1 and3
 and 2 4 share same IRQs  You mean I cant plug a mouse into Com1 and a modem
 into com3 and expect both to work

No but some OSs  COHERENT  etc  are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ In your example after accessing the
modem the mouse wont work until you reboot because the IRQ is used by
the modem

 If Answer is NO should I change IRQs for com ports to be different  And
 does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too

Yes you can change the IRQs for com34 but it depends on your other
hardware com1 uses IRQ4 com2 IRQ3  If you have only one printerport 
 IRQ7  you can change com3 to IRQ5  normally 2nd printer  For com4
you can assign IRQ2 if its free As far as I know no other IRQ can be
used until your IOcard is 16bit and caould access IRQs  8
