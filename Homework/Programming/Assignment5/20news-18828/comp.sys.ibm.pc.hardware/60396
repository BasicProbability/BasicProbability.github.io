Subject ISA bus pin question re Diamond Speedstar 24X


Today I recieved a inwarranty replacement for my
Diamond Speedstar 24X  On the card Ive noticed a few
changes mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5
The card is revision 5A

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connectsdisconnects the BALE line on the 64pin part
of the ISA bus

The question I have is simple
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X
what does the manual claim that this jumper does

To anyone with an ISAreference what is the function of the
BALE line

On a related note
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus  My motherboard manual has a simple pintosignalname
chart but that is it
