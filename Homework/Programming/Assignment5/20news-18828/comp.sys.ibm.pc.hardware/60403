 I have a 5 14 drive as drive A  How can I make the system boot from
 my 3 12 B drive  Optimally the computer would be able to boot
 from either A or B checking them in order for a bootable disk  But
 if I have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that
 it cant boot 5 14 disks thats OK  Also bootb wont do the trick
 for me

We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway  I finally
got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives  The only
reason I didnt do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 514s and some 514 based install disks which expected
the A drive  I order all new software and upgrades to be 312 and
the number of stupid install programs that cant handle an alternate
drive are declining with time  the ones I had are now upgraded  And
as for the bootable 514s I just cut 312 replacements

If switching the drives is not an option you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis  I havent tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully

I did this  I use a relay Radio Shack 4PDT instead of a huge
switch  This way if the relay breaks my drives will still work

It works fine but you may still need to change the CMOS before the
drive switch will work correctly for some programs
