OK Ill try one more time with this one If ANYONE out there has ANY
information on MicroScience hard drives and how to set the jumpers
and where they are for masterslave configurations I will gladly
accept any info as I have a 110Mer sitting in my room collecting dust
just waiting for me to install huge applications  Thanks in advance
