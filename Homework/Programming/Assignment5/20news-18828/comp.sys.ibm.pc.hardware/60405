I recently bought a Leading Edge 80386DX33 mini tower case and everything
works fine Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and whatnot I would
tend to say that it is a decent deal The only things you might want to be
wary about is that my LE computer has a backplane mounted motherboard
Ie The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane
Some people dont like these configurations The second thing is that
whoever set up my computer at the factory didnt really know what they were
doing The installed windows video driver didnt even take advantage of the
SVGA cardMonitor Look forward to configuring the system optimally
yourself
