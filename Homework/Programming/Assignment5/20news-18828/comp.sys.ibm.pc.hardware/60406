 I have the same question as Guido It is possible to use the ESDI drive 
 as a master and the IDE drive as the slave  

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave as
I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE  And custom Controller
Mdl CI1010 Extended IDE Controller  While maintaining my RLLd Wren as
master Drive  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives
while coexisting with existing Controllers  MFMRLLESDISCSI 

So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI and I can assure
you it works with RLL
