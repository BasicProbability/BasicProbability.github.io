Subject Re 20 or 21 grayscale displays

  A quick look through the Computer Shopper gave the following companies
that sell 20 monochrome monitors for less than 2000 PC or PS2 compatible
  Cornerstone Technology Digital Technology Hardware That Fits
  IBM Ikegami Image Systems Nanao Radius
  RanGer Technologies Sampo Samsung Sigma Designs

Most of these are singlescan monitors which are useless for most
PC users  I posted requests for information in other newsgroups which
were mostly fruitless but I have managed to track down two multisync
grayscal monitors in the 1721 range one 20 and one 21  I am still
looking into it and I will post the results when I get more info
I am looking into a group purchase as well
