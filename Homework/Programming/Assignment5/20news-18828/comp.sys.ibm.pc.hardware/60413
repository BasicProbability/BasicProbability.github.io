Subject IBM PS1 vs TEAC FD

Hello

I already tried our national news group without success

I tried to replace a friends original IBM floppy disk in his PS1PC
with a normal TEAC drive
I already identified the power supply on pins 3 5V and 6 12V shorted
pin 6 52535 switch and inserted pullup resistors 2K2 on pins
8 26 28 30 and 34
The computer doesnt complain about a missing FD but the FDs light
stays on all the time The drive spins up ok when I insert a disk
but I cant access it
The TEAC works fine in a normal PC

Are there any points I missed

Thank you
	Volkmar
