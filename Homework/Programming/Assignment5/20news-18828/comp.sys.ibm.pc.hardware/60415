OK all you experts
Need answer quick386 machine 144 floppy  unable to write to a formated
720 diskMachine claims that disk is write protectedbut it is not

Note It ll read 720s with no problem

Please email or post




If the disk is not an HDtype disk ie with the extra hole in the case
opposite the normal write protect hole the drive will not write to the
disk You can punch a similar hole with whatever is handy or buy a small
device a square hole puncher for about 1995see the back pages of
computer shopper magazine for it

To be brief make the hole any way you can or no writing

Of course you should be able to write a DD 720Kb disk without
making any holes
