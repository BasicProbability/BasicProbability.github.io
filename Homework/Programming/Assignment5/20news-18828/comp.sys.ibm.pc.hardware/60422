Subject Wanted Advicecomments on building a PC

In the next few months I am intending to build a 386 or 486 PC system
for remote monitoring I would welcome any comments or advice you may
have on the choice of motherboard HDDs and IO boards Recommendations
for good companies selling these would be a big help

Many thanks

Peter Green
