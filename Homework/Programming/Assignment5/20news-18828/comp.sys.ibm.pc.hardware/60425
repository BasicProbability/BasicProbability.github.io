Subject How to detect mouse at hardware level


lo all

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration
Its going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network  Actually it already is running its just not getting all
the info I want it to yet  Anyway I want to check for a mouse  I
already check for a mouse driver using the code in Microsofts Mouse
book  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs or that they ever load the driver

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine how
do I detect is a mouse is attached  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it

  Thanks in advance

Andy
