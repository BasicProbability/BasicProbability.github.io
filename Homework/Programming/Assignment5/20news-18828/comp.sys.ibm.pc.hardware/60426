     Can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if I get OS2 I might 
   need an SCSI controler rather than an IDE  Will performance suffer that
   much  For a 200MB or so drive  If I dont have a tape drive or CDROM
   Any help would be appreciated

There is a way in which a multitasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before and that is with IO overlap
With IO overlap your CPU can continue to think while disk
operations are underway whereas without overlap your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish  and disk operations take
an eternity compared to a fast CPU

So when youve got multitasking you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do

One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering  IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes with no DMA

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along
