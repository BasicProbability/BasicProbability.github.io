Subject Re IDE vs SCSI

In article 1qm5c96onhcx1ssdcsdharriscom markahcx1ssdcsdharriscom Mark Ashley writes

   First off with all these huge software packages and files that
   they produce IDE may no longer be sufficient for me 510 Mb limit

Ive seen a listing of a Seagate 1G IDE hard drive

   Second rumor is Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
   and will support it soon Im just not sure if its on DOS Win or NT

Windows NT already supports SCSI a variety of adapters for disk
tape and CDROM  So does OS2 20

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along
