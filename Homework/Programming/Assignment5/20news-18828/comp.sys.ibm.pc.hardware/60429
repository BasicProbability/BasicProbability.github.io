    but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
    than IDE on an ISA bus when it comes to multitasking OSs when
    managing data from a single SCSI hard drive
   
   A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
   from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
   and moves it to memory 

   IDE also uses DMA techniques  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA
   and most AD boards also use DMA  DMA is no big deal and has nothing to
   do directly with SCSI

IDE does not do DMA  This is because its like te PC AT hard disk
interface  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where its needed  If IDE doesnt work this way then its not
compatible

Heck if IDE used DMA then youd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble

BTW there are DMAenabling signals in the IDE cable spec but the
last report I heard was that they are never implemented because it
would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along
