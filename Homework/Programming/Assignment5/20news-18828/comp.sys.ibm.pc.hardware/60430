Subject NEC P5200 Printer question

I just picked up a secondhand color option for the NEC P5200
24pin dot matrix printer  Alas there were no installation instructions
so I am totally confused on WHY it WONT GO IN

Do I have to remove the actaual print head  It seems almost to fit
but not quite

Please any info would be most appreciated
