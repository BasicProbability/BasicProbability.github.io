I have AMI bios I have poked around the bios but havent tried this but somewhere it says BOOT AC
I would assume that you could probably slip in a b
althoug a I havent tried it and
b dont mess with your CMOS unless you know what your doing

I hate to burst your bubble but you cannot slip in a B to that
particular AMI BIOS setting That setting only allows you to set
the boot order of the floppy A with respect to the primary HD C
ie check A first then C or check C then A
