Subject Re IDE vs SCSI

Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated
8MHz clock 16 bit width 5MBsec
If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 83MBs sighted for IDE come from

SCSI is not complex It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it
There are THREE key differences in SCSI the controller chip the port and
the software  THAT IS IT
Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point

SCSI1 asynchronous and synchronous modes SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode only 03MBs vs 05MBs
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi1 divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver As is the case for the Mac Quadra

SCSI2 8bit THIS is the main source for the confusion This differs from
 SCSI1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines  In the Mac and some PCs
 this is called fast SCSI1 because it uses SCSI1 ports and software drivers
 AND can produce SCSI2 SPEEDS through SCSI1 INSPITE of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi1 mode 
 46MBs with 8MBsSee in both Quadras and higher end PCs Synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate 10MBs

SCSI2 16bit TWO versionsWideFast  Wide SCSI2 requires TWO things
 over 8bit SCSI2  a SCSI2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the
 machine and the external device
 Fast SCSI2 also requires TWO things over 8bit SCSI2 SCSI2 driver
 software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16bit fast SCSI2
 Speed of both is the same 812MBs with 20MBs burst

SCSI2 32bit  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI  Over 8bit SCSI2 this
 requires SCSI2 driver software wide SCSI2 port and that the RECIEVING
 devices ALSO have a 32bit mode SCSI2 chip  As expected this is VERY
 expencive  Speed 1520MBs with 40MBs bursts
 

As I said SIMPLE  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software the 
controler chip and the port Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to
only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE the chip and the port
