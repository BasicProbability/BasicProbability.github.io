Subject Re 17 Monitors

and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality
This monitor can be had for around 1070

Has anyone actually seen any of these 

I am responsible for choosing standard components in my company and as part
of my review i got the Viewsonic 7 Mitsubishi 17 and Nanao F550is  I picked
the F550i even though it costs more than the other two choices because it
has a the best clarity and text is not fuzzy at all  The Viewsonic 7 is the
worst the Mitsubishi 17 is much better but the Nanao F550i blows both of
them out of the water  I dont understand why the Nanao is so much better 
since one would think that the Mitsubishi 17 with its Trinitron tube would
be better  I can only imagine that the Nanao T560i must be incredible if it
is beter than the F550i

The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was
the Mitsubishi  I also reviewed a new Nanao the F550iW which has just
been released  Last year for the May 92 issue of Windows I reviewed
several monitors including the Nanao T560i  Theres no question that the
Nanao monitors are the best available this year just as they were last
year  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the
ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring  I used different tests than they did and I
scored differently  Theres nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi and it
scored very highly in my tests but it was a few points shy of perfect

Incidentally one of the things everyone should do when theyre reading
reviews of any product whether its monitors or mice is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully  Unless you know how the product
testing was done and on what the scores are based you cant possibly
know what they really mean  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking  Likewise its impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing  After all some of
what we do may not apply to you  Likewise some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another  You cant always tell
anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
dont also understand the scoring
