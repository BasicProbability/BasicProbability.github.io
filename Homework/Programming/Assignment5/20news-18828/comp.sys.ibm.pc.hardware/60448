much discussion about switching 525 and 35 drives removed

Another albeit strange option is using a program like 800 II
available via anonymous FTP at many major sites or FDFORMAT
also available via anonymous FTP that allows you to format
525HD disks to 144Meg or 35HD disks to 12Meg along with
many MANY other formats so you can DISKCOPY yes the broken
MeSsyDOS DISKCOPY the 525 disks onto 35 disks or vice
versa  I use this techniques with NONDOS selfbooting 
game disks on my old Tandy 1000 and it works  Another program
named Teledisk sharewareavailable on many major BBSs will
also make the weird format disks provided you have 800 II
or FDFormat installed  Some disks that wont DISKCOPY
properly can be readily Telediskd into the proper format
At least this is a software solution for a hardwareBIOS 
deficiency eh
