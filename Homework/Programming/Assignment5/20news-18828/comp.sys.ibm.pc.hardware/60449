Subject Rockwell Chipset for 144s  Any good

I have a quick question regarding the Rockwell Chipset
thatscome out relatively recentlyIt supports v32 v32bis
v42 Group III Fax and so on  However I heard there
are bugs in the chipset  I know someone that has a ZOOM
144 Modem that uses the chipset and he hasnt had a problem

Whats the word on the chipset  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself  And if it is the Rockwell chipset what 
are the chances that if I buy one of these modems using the
Rockwell chipset that a the bug will affect me b a ROM
change will fixcompensate for the bug

Please send responses via email
