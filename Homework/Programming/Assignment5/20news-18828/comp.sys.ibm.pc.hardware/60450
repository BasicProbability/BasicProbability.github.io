Subject Re Shopping for a new NEC monitor

well people I can only recomend the nonflatscreen nohype 
nononsense NEC 3DS that I have and PLUS it has the ADVANTAGE of
NOT having one of those new flat screen tubes which are oversensitive
and fragile and break often
this is a 15 heavyduty rugged set for those who insist on wellproven
reliable technologies
