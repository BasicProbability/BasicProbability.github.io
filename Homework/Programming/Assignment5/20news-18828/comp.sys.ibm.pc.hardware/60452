 PC Magazine just did another review of highend graphics accelerators  For all
 around performance Windows DOS CAD go for ATI Graphics Ultra Pro  Theyve
 done two reviews in the last three months and that card ranks as an editors
 choice in both reviews  For all around performance it seems it just cant be
 beat  You should pick up this issue of PCMag April 13 and check it out for
 yourself  


Windows The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are
	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card

VGA	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked
	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card  About
	 12 the speed as I recall

	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card  Each of the 
	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA  Orchid
	 is the only one I know about I dont know about AMI that uses
	 the W5286 for VGA  That is reportedly faster
	 
	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as
	 the ATI card  If so it would appear to be a formidable competitor
	 Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V9000 card  has that card arrived  What do the benchmarks look
like

Also is the AMI P9000based card real  What does it use for VGA  Speed
