Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V9000 card  has that card arrived  What do the benchmarks look
like

  The one I got only does about 4kbs in text and 320x200 VGAMCGA mode
which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards ATI 68800
does about 6kbs  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should
be much faster and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kbs
since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label I cant really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip but the spec sheet that comes with
the board no docs did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip
Winmarks 311 is about 4 mil slower than a Viper 34 vs 38 using
standard palette

  BTW if anyone is insterested Im trying to sell a Diamond Viper 2 megs
vram for a friend for 300 email if interested Im too broke to
take it myself

Also is the AMI P9000based card real  What does it use for VGA  Speed

  I think its available in limited quantites  No idea of what VGA
chip it uses though

  Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though the Orchid I got
for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as 
documentation and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller 
card or maybe its my motherboard an AIR 486 VLB
