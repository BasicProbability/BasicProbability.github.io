Subject Need info on PS2 mouse port

Would someone please email me the pinout for a PS2 6pin mini DIN mouse
port  Im trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse and the dealer who
knows what adapter works with the mouse I bought doesnt have it in stock
I have several different adapters but none of them make sense based on
what sketchy information I have about the port they have connections to
reserved pins
