Subject Re Rockwell Chipset for 144s  Any good

Whats the word on the chipset  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself

There were an assortment of firmware problems but that is pretty much
expected with any FAXmodem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new  Im pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems so youll have to get it
from someone else

However I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU as opposed to the DPU for an internal implementation
This is because the MPU used speed buffering instead of having a
16550 interface  Without the 550 interface the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions like in windows  As far as I know the speed buffering
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board

Hope this helps
Tom
