Subject Re CACHE or Micronics EISAVLB Motherboard

 CLIP I am in
 the process of purchasing an EISAVL Bus 486 DX266 computer 
 CLIP
 The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard thats
 the brand of the motherboard with OPTI chip set the other is Micron
 formerly Edge Technology and they use the Micronics EISAVLB
 motherboard
 CLIP
 I would REALLY appreciate any input on this Is the Micron machine the
 clear choice  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about
 either company Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards Should I
 go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard etc
 
 Thanks very much in advance for any information

Get back to your vendors or better yet the board manufactures and get
some more info
   Where made
   Norton indexes yeah I know BMs suck but whats a mother to do
   number of slots and types  ESIA and  32 bit
   Any IDE or SCSI on board
   How easy to upgrade RAM location and  of pins
   OVERDRIVE
   Oscilator kits
   Does it have a 16550 UART
   Whos BIOS

These might make you feel better about either system but I must 
agree that Ares with 7 days of 24 hr Tech and 2 year warranty is
encouraging
