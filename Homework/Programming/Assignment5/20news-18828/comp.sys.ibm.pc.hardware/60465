Subject Know anything about EISA2

I read about the development of EISA2 some time ago but dismissed it
in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI  However I recently
was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM
a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon

I recall that EISA2 will support 64bit transfer among other enhancements
Is there such a standard being developed
