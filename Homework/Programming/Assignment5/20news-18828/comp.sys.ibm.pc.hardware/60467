Heck if IDE used DMA then youd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble

There would be no problems as long as the OS didnt set up a DMA transfer
to an area above the 16 mb area the DMA controller probably cant be
programmed that way anyways so there probably isint a problem with this

Besides like I said before the FDD controller uses DMA channel 2
And I dont yet believe that the HDD controllers any of them MFM RLL
etc dont also use DMA
