Subject Re Know anything about EISA2

I read about the development of EISA2 some time ago but dismissed it
in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI  However I recently
was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM
a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon

I recall that EISA2 will support 64bit transfer among other enhancements
Is there such a standard being developed

	Very possibly but if its still going to be backwards compatible
with the ISA bus its going to be the same tripe that the current EISA
implementation really is

	From what Ive seen the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz
intelligent bus ie bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like
not jumpers  Hopefully itll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA 
Zorro III bus

	VL Bus is a bit too much of a hack for my liking
