 Anybody seen the date get stuck
 
 Im running MSDOS 50 with a menu system alive all the time  The machine
 is left running all the time
 
 Suddenly the date no longer rolls over  The time is reasonably accurate
 allways but we have to change the date by hand every morning  This involves
 exiting the menu system to get to DOS
 
 Anyone have the slightest idea why this should be  Even a clue as to whether
 the hardware battery CMOS or DOS is broken

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the
menu all night  There is a limitationbug in the date rollover software in
PCs that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call as menus often use otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case Ive misrememberred
them but I think you have to change the menu program if you have the sources
or add a TSR or system patch or something  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time in fact about 7 secondsday better than DOSs clock
