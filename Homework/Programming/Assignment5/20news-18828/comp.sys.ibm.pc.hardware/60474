Subject PROBLEM WITH PRINTER AND EMM386EXE

I recently decided to try using emm386exe for a memory manager and when I
tried to print to my printer in lpt1 from word55 I wouldnt work  It would
send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer READY light would
go off and stop working  I disabled emm386exe and the problem went away
I would like to continue using emm386exe if possible  I would greatly    
appreciate any comments or suggestions  please send them to arthuruwashingt
