How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus

By initiating a DMA xfer  

Seriously busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability they dont use
the motherboards onboard DMAwhich is MUCH slower

ISA has no bus arbitration so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crashI forget

Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system 07 03 are 8bit  47 are
16bit

The system uses DMA 0 a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1

I could buy a busmastering XGA2 video card  a busmastering SCSI HA

In order for them to work properly I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers

I dont know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA
Im not sure if they can on EISA systems either

I do know that on EISAMCA systems you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel

Thanks
