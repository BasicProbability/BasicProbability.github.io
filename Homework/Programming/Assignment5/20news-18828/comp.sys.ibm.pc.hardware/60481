A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion so
he sent it back  Unfortunately the replacement also was distorted  I would
bet its a common problem  The best advice Ive heard when buying monnitors
is to actually look at the specific one you will buy as opposed to model
since monitor manufacturing even from Big Names still tends to produce
alot of monitors with visible defects
