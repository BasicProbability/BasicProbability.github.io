Subject Re ISA bus pin question re Diamond Speedstar 24X


The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with bootup problems
If your system fails to bootup proprtly please pull off the jumper
block from jp5 This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x
 
This is what my manual says about jp5 I never knew that it was there
but the card is a real ask kicker in my book It beats the hell out
of my junk Sony 1604s to the point that I cant even use above 648x480
mode muchSam
Some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill like driving a Sony
with a 24x that the monitor cant handle Or installing 60ns simms and
then finding out that your mother board doesnt have a cmos wait state
adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought
 
GoshI think I just installed a virusIt was called MS DOS6
Dont copy that floppyBURN ITI just love WindowsCRASH
