Subject W32TSENG card  other VLB cards please


Hai

In a few days Im going to buy a new motherboard with localbusses
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard
It can do truecolor but I dont know what type of card it is
I read that Cirrus Logic cards arent exactly the fastes around

My old system had a TSENG 4000 I was pretty pleased with it so I
consider buying a W32TSENG card Id like to know a few things

	 How is the speedperformance in DOSWindowsUnixOS2
	  Graphics  Text also compared to S3 cards for example
	 What resolutions including no of colors does it
	  support text  graphics
	 How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	 Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	 Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card good or bad Id like
to know If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it


For the people in Holland
Kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de W32 in Nederland te verkrijg
is Het liefst in de omgeving van Amsterdam


Thanks in advance			Erik Stel estelcsvunl
