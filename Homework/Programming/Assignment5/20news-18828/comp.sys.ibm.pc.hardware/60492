I cant imagine why someone would leave their computer on all of
the time to start with Its like leaving your lights tv radio
and everything in the house on all of the time to meNuts

 Computers are a special case and its a pretty good idea to
 leave them on cuz everytime you turn on a computer youre 
 putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components
  Imagine youre turning on your computer 5 or more times a day
 Youre increasing the chances of damaging the chips memory
 etc on all the components of your computer So you may save
 a few cents here and there in electricity bills but it wont
 look like much when it come time to fix your computer
