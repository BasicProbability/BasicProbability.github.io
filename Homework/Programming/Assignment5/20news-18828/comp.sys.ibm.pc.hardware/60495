Subject SCSI on dos

Hello netters

	I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS

	I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two harddisks conected
	ids 0 and 1 Id like to connect a SCSI streamer but I
	dont have software to access it Does such a beast exist
	as shareware or PD 
	
	Also what if I want a third disk  I know that DOs only can
	see two two physical and four logical disks Will it be
	possible to use extra disks 

	Thanks in advance

	Ib
