Subject  CRROM Drive Recommendation 

Hi all

  I would like to purchase CDROM drive The specs I would like to have is

    Applicable to Kodak multisession PhotoCD
    SCSI2 Interface
    Compatible with Adaptec1542B
    Does not need any caddies
    Cheaper   500 if possible
    Double Speeded

  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition
  so I would like to know all of your opinion  The above conditions
  are sorted by my priority
  I think NEC CDR741841 is a little bit expensive but it DOES satisfy
  almost all of the above conditions The problem is that I do not know
  the compatibility with 1542B Has someone succeeded to connect these
  NEC drives to 1542B I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible
  with 1542B adapter
  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated

Thanks in advance
