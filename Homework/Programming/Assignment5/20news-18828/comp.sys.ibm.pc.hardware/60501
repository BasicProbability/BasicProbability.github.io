To sum up when an accelerated board with 4MB VRAM True Colour 1280x1024
AND A FAST VGA SIDE is available under 500 I will buy one

Me too

Whats funny is when we really CAN buy such a product it probably wont
seem as mouthwatering as it does today  What No holograms Get outta
here

I can wait cos Ive already got an accelerated card It does 1280x1024 but
only 16 colour You may mock me but such cards will be here quickly enough

One of the odd things about the computer industry is that since you can
always wait and get something better some people wait forever  I know
people who have deferred updating their original IBM PC for a decade
because every time they look at whats available they see something better
coming down the road  I know people whove dumped their PCs into the
garage but havent replaced them because theyre afraid it isnt the
right time to buy  They just gave up using computers

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing For instance Ill be upgrading my 486 33
to a 486DX2 66 EISA VLB board RSN The performance difference under Linux
is great enough to be worthwhile At the same time Ill be buying a new
graphic card and new SCSI controller Ill be buying an S3 card cos theyre
fast enough I have X11 drivers for them and itll have 2MB VRAM just like
a Weitek 9000 card It will also be MUCH cheaper When affordable 4MB cards
arrive Ill buy one

Personally my system at home needs a new disk subsystem a much
larger monitor a superfast graphics board by youknowwho a new
CPU board  I probably wont keep much more than the case and the
mouse  Come to think of it I dont like that mouse very much  So
when will I buy  When my dream products hit the market NO WAY  Im
gonna buy as soon as I have the MONEY

Over the last year Ive done much the same But now I need a 19 monitor more
memory 20MB just aint enough a GB disk 12GB and no space left Oh
well stay single dont smoke and you may afford it this year
