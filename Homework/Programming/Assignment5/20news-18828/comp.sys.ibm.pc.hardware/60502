 This may be the dumbest question of the year but is there a
 way to piggyback or expand a 6slot motherboard all 16bit
 to get the usual 8  My case has slots for 8 and Id like to
 get a scanner but with all my other cards Im already maxd out
 Im hoping that a simple solution exists eg an adapter that turns

Im not sure if this will work but how about using one of those T expanders
used in the lowprofile cases  They allow 35 slots staggered on either
side of the card  You can install it in the last slot and then probably 
have 2 or 3 sideways slots  This is actually how it is done in the low
profile cases  a standard motherboard the T connector in one slot 
and the expansion cards plugged into the T  I guess you could do this at 
each end of the slots 1  8 to add even more  

The T connectors are simply tracks with slots on them  no electronics
on it  The only downside  your case wont close but for a homebrew system
that may not be a problem

Dont know about performance though  Ill leave that discussion to the 
engineers
