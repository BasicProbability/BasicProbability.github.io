National Semiconductor  I dont know if other manufacturers make equivalent
chips or not  Maybe National isnt even the original but they are the only
one that I know about  NS16450 NS16C450 NS16C451 NS16550AF NS16C551 and
NS16C552

no argument on going direct to National see my previous post on this topic
but some info regarding what you said above  I dont know about the 8250 or
16450 but NS was the original source for the 16550 series and I strongly
suspect that they developed the others first too

I can also tell you that Im one of those who wont buy a UART made by
anyone other than National Semiconductor
