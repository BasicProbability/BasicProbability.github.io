I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller although my machine is
DX266 VLB I has the save transfer rate of 0647 MBs regardless of
the variations of the ISA bus speed I tested it with speed between
55MHz and 833MHz Not any difference The problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory

My advice Buy 4Megs of RAM save 70 and enjoy performance

Computer 28625 mhz
Bus ISA 125 mhz
Drive Maxtor 7213A 213 mb

Id still like to here from people with VLBIDE
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives
I still want to know if some most  IDE drives can handle bus speeds  8 mhz


I recently bought a Micron 486DX33 VLB computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around 1ks transfer rates says norton  I caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6xx doesnt recognize local bus and wont give accurate results  I was
told I would need norton 70 in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed

I didnt really like this answer in part because the drive doesnt seem
as though its cranking along at much more than that but I also dont
know if I could tell the difference

I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS bus speed at the like
and noticed no significant change in performance
