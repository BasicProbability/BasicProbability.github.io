	I have a question concerning SCSI on DOS

	I have a ST01 SCSI controller and two harddisks conected
	ids 0 and 1 Id like to connect a SCSI streamer but I
	dont have software to access it Does such a beast exist
	as shareware or PD 
	Also what if I want a third disk  I know that DOs only can
	see two two physical and four logical disks Will it be
	possible to use extra disks 

Contrary to what others might have thought I actually did have a SCSI drive
once  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST02 controller  I found that the
controller couldnt keep up with a 11 interleave so the best I could do
with the drive was a 21 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 ksec

I have had that drivecontroller coexist with MFM RLL and IDE drives
because the ST02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
needed from the computers bios  Dos will see many logical drives much more
than 4 Ive had up to 10  Ive often wondered how many SCSI drives you
could hang off a ST0102
