Subject TRIDENT 8800CS DRIVERS FOR WIN 31

Hello

Ive got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card but lacking suitable drivers
for windows 31 The drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible
Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers Address for an
ftpsite would be nice 

Thanks in advance

Jouni
