I almost got a hernia laughing at this one

Youll probably get one when you realize that your 100 vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks

If anything SCSI on a PC will be obsolete killed off by Vesa Local
With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus  It actually  slows down your system
Bus IDE  It must be real nice to get shafted by 20100 bucks for the
extra cost of a SCSI drive then pay another 200300 for a SCSI controller

Yeah there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics
And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB because it runs at
8 Mhz and 16 bits Do people forget that the IDE was specifically
designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus Weve seen
IDEs come out for EISA XT ISA and now even MCA but at all times
it was a 16 bit standard running at somewhere near 810 Mhz When
you run an IDE off of the VLB theres no way that youre running it
at 33 Mhz it would burn up Of course same goes for SCSI ESDI whatever
none of them run at CPU speed

The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to
a caching controller I suspect it would be much much better to
get a software disk cache instead since you get writecaching as well

because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big

Ive seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G
