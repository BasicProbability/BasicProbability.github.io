  I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX266 to run Windows
in 1280x1024  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro and Im pretty
sure the 2M is really there because I can select
1024x768x65536   But no matter what I do with the Flex program
in the ATIs program group 1280x1024 remains ghosted out
I have Windows 31 build 59 of the drivers DOS 50  The
drivers were installed by Gateway not by me so perhaps theres
a file missing from the hard drive  It runs 1024x768 just fine
  I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024  Sometimes
it refuses ghosted out other time it accepts it but when I hit
OK and reenter Desktop its back to 1024x768  At no time does
it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window  Help

Maybe you need to go into mach32install and set a refresh rate for
1280x1024  You might need to use custom monitor option
