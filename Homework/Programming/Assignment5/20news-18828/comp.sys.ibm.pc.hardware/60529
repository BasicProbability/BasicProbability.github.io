It was the Seagate 296N and the ST02 controller  I found that the
controller couldnt keep up with a 11 interleave so the best I could do
with the drive was a 21 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 ksec

According to what others have told me the ST296N is difficult to run at
the 11 interleave even though Seagate claims it  I have a nonpc system
dont ask what it is you probably havent heard of it that is built
around SCSI and it cant do 11 either
