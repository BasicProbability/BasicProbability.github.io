I cant imagine why someone would leave their computer on all of
the time to start with Its like leaving your lights tv radio
and everything in the house on all of the time to meNuts


We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the
time I dont see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the
offices which does get turned off at the end of the day In fact some
of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the
offices But it goes both ways so cant conclude anything
