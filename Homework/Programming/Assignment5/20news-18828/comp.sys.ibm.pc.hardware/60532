I also reviewed a new Nanao the F550iW which has just
been released

Whats the difference between the F550i and the new F550iW  Im
about to buy a Gateway system and was going to take the F550i
upgrade  Should I get the F550iW instead

The F550iW is optimized for Windows  It powers down when the screen
blanker appears it powers down with you turn your computer off and it
meets all of the Swedish standards  Its also protected against  EMI from
adjacent monitors 

Personally I think the F550i is more bang for the buck right now
