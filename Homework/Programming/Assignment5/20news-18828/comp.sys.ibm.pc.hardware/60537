 My emergency management group was given about 30 COMPAQ DESKPRO 286s
 from a local company as they were outdated  Problem is though it
 seems that the CMOS settings cannot be set without this Diagnostic
 Disk
 We get this error msg on boot up

     Insert DIAGNOSTIC diskette in Drive A
 
 If someone has this disk please email me  Thank You

You have probably solved your problem by now  Anyway if you can get your
hands on QA Plus version 421 maybe others as well it will let you write
the COMPAQ CMOS settings  I know because I just did it 

I was just about to search for such a diagnostic disk when my brotherinlaw 
fixed an old DESKPRO with it  You might try the simtel mirror FTP sites
