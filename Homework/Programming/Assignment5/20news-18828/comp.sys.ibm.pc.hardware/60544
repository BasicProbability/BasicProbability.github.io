Hi

I just bought a Mitsumi CDROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard  The pin outs on
the CDROM lineout and the SB Pro CDIN are not the same  I am considering
taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to
the linein input on the SB Pro  Will this work with multimedia software
that uses the CDROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CDIN pins on
the SBPro

Thanks

John
