Subject Motherboards  Hard Drives
From vacsc0qeVAXCSUNEDU

I have just a few quick questions  Does anyone here have a 486 DLC
system a Cyrix 486 DX  Any problems with it  
Second how much should a Cyric 486DLC33 motherboard with
no RAM run me  
3rdShould a total amatuer like myslef be able to perform
a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician or is it
beyond hope
4thI hear that some if not all hard drives may require reformatting
if you switch them to another computer or motherboard as the case may
be  Is there any truth to this

Any replies would be greatly appreciated
