Is there a more recent version of umbdr522zip because it doesnt
work on my machine
My motherboard has Symphony SL82C362 chips and they say it will be
supported in the later versions so is it out 

Thank you for helping

The last I heard the author was having some problems in his immediate
family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time
This was some months ago

Its a shame  The driver is the best memory manager I have found
ANYWHERE  It doesnt require V8086 mode like QEMM so it works with
Ultima 7  It doesnt take ANY memory runs then exits

If only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable
