Subject DEC MT 486 Adaptec SCSI 3COMM conflict


I have a DEC NT 486DX33 that has an Adaptec SCSI controller hard disk
and cdrom drive When I add a 3COMM Ethernet card 3C503 and reboot
the system I receive an error message that a boot device cannot be
found Pull the 3COMM card and reboot everything is fine Ive moved
the controller and 3COMM card to various slots different positions
slot before the controller slot after the controller with the
same result DEC hasnt responded to the problem yet Any help would
be appreciated
