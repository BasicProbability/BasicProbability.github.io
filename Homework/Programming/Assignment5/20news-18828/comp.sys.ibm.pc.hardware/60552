I have just installed a Diamond Stealth 24 ISA card in
a 486DX266 system with 256K cache and 16 megs of memory
that gets about a 126 SI 60 CPU Benchmark rating  Using
the 1024x768x16 color driver under Windows I am getting a
Winbench Winmarks rating of only about 95 Million  Since
I have heard that others get 15to16 million for this card
I assume that something is very wrong with my setup

What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this

Most importantly which Winbench version are you using  On my local bus ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro Ive gotten various Winbench scores from 158 million to
31 million winmarks depending on the version  Winbench 25 gives the most
optimistic scores 311 gives the least  A winmark rating is meaningless
without a corresponding version number
