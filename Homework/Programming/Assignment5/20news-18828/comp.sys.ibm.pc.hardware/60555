Subject Re HELP Installing second IDE drive

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive a Seagate 210MB
I can look up the model number if its important and Ive been
trying to help him install it  Ive got a vested interest since
my machines busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed
He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD again I forget the model number
but I can find out

Anyway I cant seem to get the bloody thing up  Ive managed to get
one or the other drive up with the other disconnected but not both
at the same time whenever I try the thing hangs during bootup 
never gets past the system test  The IDE controllers instruction
sheet says it supports two drives I think Ive configured the CMOS
correctly the powers plugged in properly I even learned about the
masterslave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have didnt
know PCs were into SM 8 and I think I configured the jumpers
properly the 85MB one is the master the new 210MB one is the slave

The only thing I can think of is maybe Im doing the cabling wrong  Ive
tried several combinations

controller  master  slave
controller  slave  master
master  controller  slave

None of them worked  Unfortunately I cant think of any others

Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives C and D and the CMOS asks for C drive and D
drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others
Ive seen  Could this be confusing things

So I need HELP  The drive came bereft of any docs except for some
info for the CMOS setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card I cannibalized the cable its one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle so
it looks like a serial connection now I be lost

Many many thanks in advance  This is practically an emergency I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday  Help

Ive been told by our local computer guru that you cant do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning  I took him at his word and I 
have not tried to find out any more about it because Im not going to back 
everything up just to add another HDD  If anyone knows for sure what the 
scoop is I would like to know also  Thanks in advance also
