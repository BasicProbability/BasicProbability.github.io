Subject HELP  My ESDI is posessed by demons


HELP  I really got ripped off and I need some help unripping myself

I bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from HiTech for 300 then paid to
get it repaired for about another 300  Heres the deal  The thing works
fine  It low level formats etc without any bad spots at all  AND THEN
Jaws Music sectors start going bad  EEK  One at a time  Norton disk
doctor keeps marking some U and some C  That FIXES it  For about 5 minutes

Then next day when I run NDD on it again NO DICE more uncorrectable and
correctable sectors  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH  So I fugure Ok NDDs
just not being thurough enough Ill use Spinrite I heard that works well
What happens  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use  
AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH  NDD undoes it of course  The problem seams to
be getting worse and worse  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted
again the problem goes away for a while only to return in a day or so

Im so pissed off right now Im considering buying another HDD and I really
cant afford it

Im using SMARTDRIVE and WINDOWS 31 Im not using the 32 bit disk access
though I know that can create problems  The disk is using the second
option to trick the controller into thinking its got less then 1024 cyls
and everything else selected is standard maybe I need to use a different
head skew or something  I dont know

ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW HELP
