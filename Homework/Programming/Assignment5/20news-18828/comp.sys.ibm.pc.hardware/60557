Subject Help Ten beeps with 38640 AMI BIOS

I have a 38640 motherboard with AMI BIOS
I havent located the little motherboard manual yet
and suddenly its giving me 10 beeps when I turn the power on
It was working fine this morning
then gave all kinds of problems in Windows and outside it
After multiple reboots now it only gives 10 beeps and sits there

Anybody know what 10 beeps means
Thanks
