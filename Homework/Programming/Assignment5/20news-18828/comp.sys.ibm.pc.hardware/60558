Subject Help with motherboard wno docs

Well I was told that my last message came through without anything
in it so Ill try again

I have a Leading Edge 386SX 16 with a flaky motherboard and a friend
game me one to replace it but he didnt have any docs for the 
mother board  Its a CHEERTRON board with Award bios and has a   
sticker on it that says VI 1   T1 3  T2 3  on it  I can tell what
most of the switches on the blue blocks mean  except FDC and
SH but I have no idea about all the jumpers  Ive replaced hard
drives and modems and installed math coprocesses but this is a
bit out of my league and without the docs Im really lost

If anyone could give me some help on this Id really appreciate
it  I dont get on news regularly so if you can help please
email me at passmanworldstdcom

Thanks

 Shirl
