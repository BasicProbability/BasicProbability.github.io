Subject Help needed in setting up NCSA Telnet w AppleTalk or Phonenet


Okay Im trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple okay a whole bunch
of machines  Theyre all true blue IBMs with either Fallon Phonenet cards
or Dastar cards  I belive those names are correct  Well the docs for
telnet say that itll run over an AppleTalk driver but Ive had little
success

If anyone has succesfully installed Telnet w AppleTalk Id like some
help with the config file for Telnet

BTW please reply via Email if possible

Thanks

Jeremy
