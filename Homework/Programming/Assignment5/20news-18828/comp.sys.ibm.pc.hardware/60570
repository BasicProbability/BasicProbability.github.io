Subject Need pinouts for ext db25 floppy connectors please


Hi all This is my first posting so be gentle

I have a Zenith external floppy which has a DB25 connector and Id
like to use it with my Sharp and Toshiba laptops which also take a
DB25 for their ext floppy but it doesnt work  I have the pinouts
for the Zenith and would like to make adapters so I can use it

Does anyone have pinouts for these or other manufacturers DB25 ext
floppy connectors  I would greatly appreciate this info either by
email or fax

Thanks very much
