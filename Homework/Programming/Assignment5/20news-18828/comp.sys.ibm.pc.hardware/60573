   I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX266 to run Windows
 in 1280x1024  I ordered a 2M ATI Ultra Pro and Im pretty
 sure the 2M is really there because I can select
 1024x768x65536   But no matter what I do with the Flex program
 in the ATIs program group 1280x1024 remains ghosted out
 I have Windows 31 build 59 of the drivers DOS 50  The
 drivers were installed by Gateway not by me so perhaps theres
 a file missing from the hard drive  It runs 1024x768 just fine
   I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024  Sometimes
 it refuses ghosted out other time it accepts it but when I hit
 OK and reenter Desktop its back to 1024x768  At no time does
 it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window  Help

I had a problem getting 256 colors I was stuck with 16 even though
the flexstuff said I was at 1024256  I solved it by entering
the advanced window on the flex program pannel and changing the
color palette  Sorry for the vaugeness I hope it helps some

BTW I have a GW200066V and 1M ATI GUP
