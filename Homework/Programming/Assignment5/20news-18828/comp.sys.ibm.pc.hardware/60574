 The F550iW is optimized for Windows  It powers down when the screen
 blanker appears it powers down with you turn your computer off and it
 meets all of the Swedish standards  Its also protected against  EMI from
 adjacent monitors 

Thanks for the info

 Personally I think the F550i is more bang for the buck right now

How much more does the F550iW cost

I think the difference is about 400 dollars but I could be wrong  These
things change between press time and publication
