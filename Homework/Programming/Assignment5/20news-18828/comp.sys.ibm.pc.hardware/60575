Subject Re How much should I pay for a SCSI cable with 3 or 4 connectors

  Also I seem to remember a posting saying that the SCSI spec calls for
  1 foot between devices on the cable but most cables you get internal
  dont meet the spec
 
 SCSI II Draft Proposal Rev 10h Section 421 SingleEnded 
 cable which is in the Cable Requirements Section has an 
 implementors note  Stub clustering should be avoided Stubs 
 should be spaced at least 03 meters apart
 
 For the nontechnical stubs are SCSI devices 

However also be aware that Implementors notes are basicly
recommendations they are NOT part of the spec  As others have
noted many vendors including SGI violate this  Indeed the main
point is to reduce impedance changes and therefore reflections and
therefore noise on the bus
