Subject Cant set COM4

I have been unable to get COM 4 to work  diagnostic programs such as msd show
nothing installed  I think the software options are OK  is there a known
hardware conflict andor workaround for this problemand CD ROM
System is a G2K 486DX266 tower with ATI video card
Ports are set as follows 
  On board COMa  COM1 IRQ4 to external device
  Internal modem  COM 3 IRQ5
  DFIO port card primary port  COM 2 IRQ3  mouse
  On board COM B  COM 4 IRQ 9   DOES NOT WORK
I have run this from a boot disk with only commandcom to eliminate softwar

Any suggestions before I call technical support
