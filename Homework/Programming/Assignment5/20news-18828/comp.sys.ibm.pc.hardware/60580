Subject Run box wo cover 


Bi am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding
Bextended operation of my G2K 48633V with the cover removed
Bfrom the enclosure  there are a  of reasons i am considering
Bthis including quick access to jumpers during complex io card
Bsetups

Bmy concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the
Bcooling flow of air from the fan hot spots may develop on my
Bmotherboard or elsewhere

If you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system most
offices or homes have positive ventilation you can generally run a
system without the cover for extended periods without a problem Im
talking about completely removing the cover  not just leaving the slots
uncovered HOWEVER the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is RF sheilding Operating a system without the full cover may create
problems with other equipment such as your neighbors TV or Ham radio
station  very much a nono in the eyes of the law
