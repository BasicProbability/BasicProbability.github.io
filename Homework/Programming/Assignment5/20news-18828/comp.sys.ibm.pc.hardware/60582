Subject DOS 60

I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 60 
Thats 100 of the people I know with DOS 60 Both have
had to reformat their disks and start over  One had drive D compress and work
fine only to compress C to have the thing choke spit out an unintelligable
warning and then hang  All that was left on either drive was autoexecbat
and configsys  Calls to Microsoft only met with busy signals  After reformatting
the drive Im not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 60 or stay with a known
entity

The other may have been a marginal drive however his upgrade failed
he had to format a floppy disk at 60 format the drive and then reinstall

I make now claims since I was not driving at the time however be careful
and make sure you back important things up

I am interested in any other people with similar or success stories
