   Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated
   8MHz clock 16 bit width 5MBsec
   If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 83MBs sighted for IDE
   come from

Well some quick math on my part shows that an 83MHz bus 16 bits
wide performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 83M
bytessec  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer so that reduces the transfer rate to 55MBs
which is the commonlyused figure for ISA bus speed  However I
believe a twoclock transfer is possible 0 wait states

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along
