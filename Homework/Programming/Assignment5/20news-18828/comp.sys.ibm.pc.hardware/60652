Subject Re Date is stuck

When you leave your radio on at night it may not be doing anything useful
But computers can do something useful even when YOU are not in front of it
Just because MSDOS and WINDOZE does not know how to schedule tasks does
not mean that all computers hould be shut down every night

I bet starting up NT every morning means a good coffee break

If someone asks if you are a God you say YES

In addition to startup time I leave things running because my PC doubles as 
a fax machine 

However this is off the original subject I didnt get the replies on BIOS 
CMOS and DOS clockdate logic All I know is that Ive been running this way 
for many months and it is only recently the last month that I have noticed 
the intermittent clock problem As I stated it is not always the date that 
doesnt roll forward sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes 
behind where it ought to be 

When unattended the following are generally running minimized in Win 31

Clock WinFax Pro 30 Print Manager MSWord 11 File Manager Program 
Manager

A random screen saver is generally running too
