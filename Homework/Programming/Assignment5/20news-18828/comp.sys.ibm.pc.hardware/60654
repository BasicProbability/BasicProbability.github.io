Subject Gateway 2000  booting from floppy


I have a Gateway 4DX33V with my 35 inch floppy as drive A  I
accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up rather than getting
the Nonsystem diskette message the machine hangs and the CMOS
gets overwritten luckily Gateway sends a print of the standard
CMOS settings with their systems  This only happens with a box
of preformatted Fuji disks that I have no other disks cause this
problem  If I reformat one of the Fuji disks the problem goes away
I did a virus scan scan v102 of the disks and found nothing

Anyone have any idea what is going on here  Hardware problem  A
virus that cant be detected  The system reading in garbage from
the boot sector
