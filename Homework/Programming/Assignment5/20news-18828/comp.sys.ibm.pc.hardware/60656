Subject Re Debugging possible hardware problems

Im running Linux on an 80486 EISA system and Im having what I think are
hardware problems  It could be software but I dont see why Id be the
only one having trouble  Id like some advice on how best to debug this

The symptom when I try to build gcc I get unpredictable and unrepeatable
results  Sometimes a o file is not in valid aout format  Recompiling the
file gives me a valid binary  Sometimes the compiler aborts or dumps core
but works fine when run again with the same input  Compiling the same
source files with the same arguments gives slight differences in a few
object files  Note that Linux unlike many other systems does not put
timestamps in object files so compiling twice should give bitidentical
results

I also have occasional filesystem corruption on my SCSI drive but that
could be caused by using development software  It could also be related to
my problems compiling  The compile problems are not caused by disk
problems I get the same results whether I do my work on an IDE or SCSI
disk

Ive set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommended values

Recommended for what DOS That is a junk


I suspect the external cache but I have no real evidence for this

The motherboard is a NICE SuperEISA with 256 KB writeback cache and a DX2
66 Mhz processor

What Im looking for

	 A system test program to run under DOS or Linux

	Linux  gcc Fire up gcc to compile libc and kernel at the
	same time running X11R5


	 Suggestions about the cause of the problem

	Bad memory bad motherboard bad cache


	 Suggestions about how to debug the problem


	change wait state of RAM
	turn off turbo
	change bus speed
	swap RAM
