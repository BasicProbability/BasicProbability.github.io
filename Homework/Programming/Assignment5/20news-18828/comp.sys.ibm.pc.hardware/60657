 Whats the difference between loading mousecom in autoexecbat and
 doing devicemousesys in configsys

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded mousesys will be
loaded during the configsys and therefor before the commandcom mousecom
will be loaded during autoexecbat and so after the commandcom

 which one is better

mousecom could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could  perhaps  be unloaded if no other driver is loaded after it
The working of both drivers is totally the same

When I ran dos I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexecbat
because some programs wont run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup But with DRDOS6 this advantage is gone
because DRDOS lets you choose in configsys which drivers should be loaded
