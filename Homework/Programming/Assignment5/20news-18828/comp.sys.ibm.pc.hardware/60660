I am running a Unisys PW2 386SX20 with DOS 6  My problem even when I had DOS
50 is that when I have EMM386 loaded I cant CTLALTDEL  If I do the
computer beeps a few times rapidly and hangs  Then I have to use the obscure
reset requires a screwdriver or pencil or the power switch to reboot  Does
anyone have a solution to this problem

Email me at x51948b1usma1usmaedu
