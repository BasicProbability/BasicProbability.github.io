    I saw a posting earlier that refered to FUNETFI directory pubmsdos
however when I log on to FUNETFI I cant even find the pub directory
let alone the msdos directory   Can someone tell me what Im doing
wrong

Perhaps you should try nicfunetfi instead of funetfi 
nicfunetfi is THE biggest  ftp site from Europe but
the stuff available there should  also be available at the other site
of the big pool
