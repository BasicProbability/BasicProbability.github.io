 How stable are the build 59 drivers  Are people having success installing
 and running with these
 


    Ive been using the Build59 drivers on a GW2K 4DX266V for several
weeks with no problems Im running Windows in 1024x758 and all software
Ive run has worked fine This includes many games and the CDbased 
multimedia encyclopedia on which the fullmotion video works fine
Id recommend you give them a try
