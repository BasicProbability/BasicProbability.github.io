Subject PCs from Gateway  opinions sought


Sorry if this has been beaten to death on this forum

I am looking seriously at buying a 486 DX  33 from Gateway
I will probably buy it without a monitor as Ive heard negative
stuff about Gateway monitors

Ive also heard its tough to get through to technical
support

Im seeking opinions on whether or not its wise to go ahead
based on criteria such as price warranty service general
ruggedness of the system reliability of the machine and of
Gateway too and so on

Please advise

Thanks in advance
