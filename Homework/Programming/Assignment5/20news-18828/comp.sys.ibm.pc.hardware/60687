While playing around with my Gateway 2000 localbus machine last
night it became apparent that Windows 31 didnt give the option
for 32bit access for virtual memory

I am using a permanent swap file and the disk drive is on the local
bus interface

Is this expected or should I be investigating further why no 32bit
option appears


you  need to massage few switches in your systemini
in the virtual memory section flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the 
associated driver wdctl or some such switch on  this will enable
32bit access but be sure you can use it as not all hard drives
and controllers support it   


for seriously fast disk access

1  throw out WINDOZE
2  install OS2

i did this weekend  OS2 is incredible  finally a REAL OS for
the humble PC
