 reference to running ATIs Install Program and using
  its functions to positionsize images at various
  resolutions

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is resized the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections  For this reason I use the
factory defaults for positionsize on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually only the first time
at the monitor  The MAG and many other multiscan
monitors has have the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is detected
