Subject Re DOS 60
From venablefacultycoewvuedu Wallace Venable


I know of two people who have horrer stories about the DOS 60
Thats 100 of the people I know with DOS 60 Both have
had to reformat their disks and start over

	I used the standard installation program to put MSDOS 60 on my
machine with Stacker 30 already installed  No problems  I kept Stacker
rather than switch
	I am very pleased with the memory I gained since I did not have a
memory manager  I also like the multiple boot feature
