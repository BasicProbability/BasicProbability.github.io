Subject HOW is a Null Modem Cable


	I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem
cable Actually I have NO idea so dont count that last statement  What Im
asking is what pins does it use or what are its specifications  I just want
to solder one myself instead of buying one  I dont even know what port is
used

Help me please at kekimmellvaxcnsmuskingumedu

Kevin

ps  Im intending to use the cable for PCtoPC transfers via LapLink or
Telix  Ideas and info gladly accepted
