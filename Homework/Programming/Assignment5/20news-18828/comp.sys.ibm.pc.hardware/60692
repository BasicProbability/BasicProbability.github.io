Subject WANTED Your opinions on the Insight Talon TA1000 or TA2000 Multimedia kits


For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution
     Network Inc and their Multimedia Kits

Im seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA2000 MM Kit which
is bundled with the CDROM drive with 265280ms access time 300Kb dtr
multispin multisession Photo CD capability etc and with the PAS16
sound card etc if you are familiar with Insight you know the kit
I mean  I believe the drive is either a Texel 265ms or an NEC
280ms but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle at least two of their sales people couldnt give me a straight
answer as to which one ah yes one of the drawbacks of OEM

Other questions

 Excuse my ignorance but is Texel a reputable maker in the CDROM
  market  Or do you think NEC is the better drive

 Bottom line  Is this kit worth the money  Currently 449 for the
  TA1000 and 699 for the TA2000

Alternatively I was thinking that the TA2000 might be overkill for my
uses however I do want full multimedia capabilities Photo CD stuff
educational programs for my kids etc and considered the lowerend
TA1000 kit and using the difference around 25000 to get something
else useful like a tape backup drive unit

Basically I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED
these kits and whatever proscons you might advise preferably
directly to the email address below

Thanks

Koji
