Subject Re HINT 486 VLBISAEISA motherboard

I am looking at buying some Companion brand VLBISAEISA motherboards with
HINT chipsets  Has anybody had any experience with this board good or bad
Any information would be helpful
thanks

I believe that any VLEISAISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24bit EISA DMA where real EISA DMA is 32bit  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA  For this
reason I would pass  I own one of these HAWK VLEISAISA and am look
ing to replace it for exactly this reason

Please doublecheck me on this  In other words call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32bit EISA
DMA

Other than this limitation the motherboard works quite well I am using
mine with DOS 5 Windows 31 and UNIX S5R32  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter
