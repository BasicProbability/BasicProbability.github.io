 How hot should the CPU in a 48633 DX machine be

 Currently it gets so hot that I can not hold a finger on it for more than
 05 s 

I seem to recall that 486s run somewhere close to the boiling point of water
Anyone have an exact temperature

Anyway putting a CPU fanheat sink on it wont hurt and could help Depends
on how paranoid you are
