 Hi
 	I recently purchased the Toshiba 3401 CDROM  I own an Adaptec 1542B
 SCSI card and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS  It
 works very well under OS2 so I know that the drive is not faulty
 In my configsys I have aspi3dossys aspidisksys aspicdsys  In my 
 autoexecbat I have MSCDEX which came with DOS 60  MSCDEX seems to find
 and install the drive as drive F but when I switch to that drive and try a
 dir I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
 like that  The CDROM is locked too and the adaptec utilities dont seem to
 recognize that I have a CDROM at that point
 	Has anyone ever had this problem  Is there something abvious that I
 am missing  And finally I was wondering if anyone using this setup could 
 kindly post hisher configsys and autoexecbat
 

Hi

One of the ASPIdrivers I think its the ASPICD supports a NORST
paramter which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads This
fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptectosh 
3401
