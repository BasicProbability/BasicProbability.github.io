Subject Volante Warp 10 board

Ive been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection
Faults on a 48633 EisaVLB system  At this point I think Ive narrowed
the problem down to the video drivers for the Volante Warp10 adapter by
National Design INc

Yet somehow I find this hard to believe  Does anyone else have any
experiences with this board

Thanx
