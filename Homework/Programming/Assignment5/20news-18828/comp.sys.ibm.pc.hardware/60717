Subject How do I put an HD on an XT

This may be a dumb question but I need to put a hard drive on my fathers
PCXT either MFM RLL or IDE I know how to hook it up but how do I tell
the computer the geometry of the drive On my 386 you set it in the BIOS but
I doubt thats how its done on an XT I thought it might be software with
the controller card but the IDE card for XTs that I saw didnt come with
any Also how do I low level format it once its on the computer Assuming
a drive which needs formatting

advTHANKSance
