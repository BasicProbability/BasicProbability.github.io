Subject Where can I buy a BIOS

Im in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 110 got a new hard disk
discovered my BIOS doesnt have a type 47 and I would like know where I
can purchase one of these things

I checked with the motherboard manufacturer for the curious its from
Mylex and hearing the 60 figure prompted me to at least try to shop
around

Problem is I dont know where to shop around for something like this

I have heard that theres a BIOS speciality shop in the South Bay and its
been alleged that they advertise in the MicroTimes

Did find the MicroTimes didnt find the ad or the shop

So can anybody help me out on this quest

To anybody who replies to this Thanks in advance
