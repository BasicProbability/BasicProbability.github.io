Subject Re 35 floppy only reads what IT wrote

 I have a Gateway with a 35 floppy The drive only reads files it
 wrote to the floppy Floppies that have been formatted and 
 contain files from other machines are unreadable Also 35 floppies
 that were written by this defective floppy drive a long time ago are
 also unreadable
 
 This sounds like a head alignment problem

Too right it does

  How does one go about
 fixing it Are there alignment screws that you can adjust

The VERY VERY FIRST thing you do is make sure that ALL files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive which arent
already on your HD or another floppy if you have two floppy drives
get copied to your HD andor to a floppy in your other drive

If you dont do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye  Well you can try to remisalign the drive back
to read your floppies but dont count on be able to do so

Generally head alignment is something Id only trust to a good repair
shop though there arehave been DIY guides
