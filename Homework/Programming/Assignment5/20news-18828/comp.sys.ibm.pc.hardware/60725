Subject Gateway ethernet card drivers needed




Hi all  
   
    
    Could anybody please tell me where I might be able to find device drivers 
for a couple of older Gateway ethernet cards  I dont have the model number
off hand but they have only a BNC connector and a header connector for 
a Novell keycard one has one installed
 
    Im looking at using these with a 2 node copy of 10net that I picked up
at a swap meet  Id love to do Lantastic or Netware lite but Im a poor
college student and the price was right

    Please reply via email as I havent had a lot of time for news because
of exams and such
