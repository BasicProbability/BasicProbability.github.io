Subject Otronics Attache luggable info needed


Hi all
 
    Im looking for some info regarding an old pcmade by Otronics or
maybe Oltronics called the Attache  This little beauty is an 8088
 Z80 luggable with a 4 or 5 inch screen monochrome CGA and 2 360
floppies  
    For serial ports it has 2 DB15 connectors one is labled printer
and I cant figure out the pinouts for them  I also dont know if they 
are standard com ports addressable as COM1 and COM2  I have figured out 
that theyll only work with DOS 2something  
    
    If anyone can give me some pointers on this one Id be most 
appreciative  Please reply via email as I cant keep up with news 
lately  Finals are coming up you know  

Thanks much
