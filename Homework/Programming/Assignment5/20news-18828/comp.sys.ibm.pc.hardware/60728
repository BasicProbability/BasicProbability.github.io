Subject Re Help with hooking Irwin tape drive to PC


     I would like to thank all those people who responded to my post  I 
would however like to clear some things up  My tape drive is external
Also the connector on the back of it is of the male DB37 pin variety
As a result I cannot easily find a costeffective solution to use the drive

     Any advice will be greatly appreciated  I would prefer email
     Thanks
