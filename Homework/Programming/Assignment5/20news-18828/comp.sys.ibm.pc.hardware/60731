   Hi
       I am buying a Quantum LPS240AT 245 MB hardisk and is deciding a
       HDDFDD controller Is 32bit VLbus HDDFDD controller faster 
       than 16 bit IDE HDDFDD controller card

No VLbus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus and if
you hook it to VLbus itll work as fast as the slower of the two
meaning ISA speed

       I hear that
       the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller

On the other hand I wouldnt expect it to be slower

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along
