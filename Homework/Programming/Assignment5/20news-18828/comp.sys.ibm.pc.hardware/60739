So the lowly lowdensity original PC FDD card used DMA and the PCAT
HDD controller doesnt  That makes real sense

Actually it does make a reasonable amount of sense Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller and transferring them to
memory with a rep insw or whatever the instruction is called is
quite efficient single instruction goes as fast as the
controllercpu know how to use the bus Since the 286 wasnt cached
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance and
its possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles for computing as does the rep insw sequence

The floppy on the other hand is not buffered so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer as was done on the PC Jr by the way really
does stink
