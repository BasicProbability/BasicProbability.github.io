Subject What do you know about Cornell Systems

The subject says it all Im wondering if anyone on the net has
had any experiences with Cornell Computer Systems of California
I was checking out their ad in Computer Shopper and they seem to
have a good balance between service price and hardware The question
is  are they reliable

Email responses would be appreciated

Thanks
