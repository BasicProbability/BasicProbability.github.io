Subject Multi IO card with 16550 UARTs

Is it possible to buy a serial IO card with the 16550 UARTs built in
rather than having to buy them separately and socketing them in

My current IO card uses 8250s correct number The braindead ones anyway
It also controls two floppy drives and two IDE hard drives

Ideally Id like to get a new multi IO card that had 2 serial ports with
16550s and could also control another 2 IDE HDs It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports and the IDE controller so
it could coexist with my existing card

Does such a beast exist Now the hard part  where can I get one in Australia
preferably Brisbane

Thanks
