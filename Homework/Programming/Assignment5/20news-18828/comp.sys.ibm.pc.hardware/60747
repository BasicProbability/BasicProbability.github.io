 Hi
 	I recently purchased the Toshiba 3401 CDROM  I own an Adaptec 1542B
 SCSI card and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS  It

One of the ASPIdrivers I think its the ASPICD supports a NORST
paramter which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads This
fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptectosh 
3401

Regards

  Terje
It worked
Thank you very much
