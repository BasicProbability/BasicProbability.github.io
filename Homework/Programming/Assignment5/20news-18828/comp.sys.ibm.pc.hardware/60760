Subject Parity Error  System Halted anyone have any ideas

I recently bought an AMD 38640  The motherboard booklet says
the board is a 391 WBH  I have 4 1x3 simms on board  The machine
also uses a Super IDE IO Card model PT604 of course niether
the motherboard or the IO card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
are Im also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card

	Anyway thats all of the pertinent info I can think of
My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays Parity Error 
System Halted messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error
Checking to disabled or enabled in the setup of the bios makes sense
Its AMI bios so it must be an AMI board

	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
SIMMS but I keep getting the same error more frequently now  It all
worked at the dealer and didnt start screwing up till I got home figures

	Ive tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even reinserted them
in reverse order making sure that the connections were solid

	My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controllerserial
parallelgameport IO card or to the motherboard God forbid

	CAN ANYONE HELP

Thanks Peace
