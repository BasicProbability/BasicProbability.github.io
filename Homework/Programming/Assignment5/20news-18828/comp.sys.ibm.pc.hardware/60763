 Id like to add a second S3 based video card to my system  Does anyone
 know of a company that sells a card that can coexist with another one
 All I really need is color text on one monitor and fast color graphics
 on the other
 
 Probably just a configurable address would do it
 
 
 For what its worth I havent confirmed it a Diamond techrep told
 me that ALL S3based video cards use port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8
 If this is true it appears that you canNOT use more than one S3 card
 in your system
 
	Actually there is an S3based card on the market that supports
	multiple adapters in one system Unfortunately It is VLBus
	only They may have an ISA version by now from a company
	called Metheus The address and phone number is

			Metheus Corp
			OGC Science Park
			1600 NW Compton Dr
			Beaverton OR  970066905
			5036901550
	Be aware this is a very highend card capable of 4MB of VRAM
	so it does not come CHEAP But I have personally seen TWO of
	these boards running a dual screen Windows 31
