I think its impossible to let ATBus operated too much more than
8MHz  I have a C  T Neat 28620 mother board And I set the ATBUS
clock to 10 MHz but the HD stopped when it boot  So its correct
that CLKn means how many wait states

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller cant handle the faster BUS speed  I have a 48633DX I set my bus divider to CLK25 that is close to 13MHz  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed  And my system work flawlessly under this setting  And you know what when I go to CLK217MHz BUS my HD refuse to boot  

Just my 2 cent
