Just poke out the little pins in the connector and then replace them in
the correct slots

Is this reverisible  You can unpoke as easy as you poke


Yep  Ive done this too  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
down on the latch of each pin and then pull it out of the connector  Label
each one first with tape so you dont get them confused after youve pulled
them out  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals
to get the correct orientation
