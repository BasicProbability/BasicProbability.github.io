Subject Old keyboards never die


Hello

Iam almost ashame to ask this question It really looks like a FAQ but couldnt
find the answer Anyway

The original IBMPCXT 83 or 84 key keyboard is in my opinion still the best
keyboard around Function keys on the right place eh left place firm click
etc Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality Ie the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc It seams to me that the pins 
electrical specs of the old and the new keyboard are however the same 
Maybe the communication protocol is different 

Please answer by email Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible
In that case i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology

Thanks

Duco
