      Can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why if I get OS2 I might 
    need an SCSI controler rather than an IDE  Will performance suffer that
    much  For a 200MB or so drive  If I dont have a tape drive or CDROM
    Any help would be appreciated
 
 So when youve got multitasking you want to increase performance by
 increasing the amount of overlapping you do
 
 One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
 possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
 without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
 the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
 bus mastering
  
 How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus
 
 IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
 created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
 bytes with no DMA
 
 If were talking ISA AT bus here then you can only have 1 DMA channel
 active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device
 So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus explain how
 all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
 to the ISAAT bus at the same time

Think

Its the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices This is typically used in a multitasking OS to
start transfers on several devices While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it This is typically a 1020ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time

 
 Also Im still trying to track down a copy of IBMs AT reference book
 but from their PC technical manual page 293
 
 The FDD adapter is buffered on the IO bus and uses the System Board
 direct memory access DMA for record data transfers
 I expect to see something similar for the PCAT HDD adapter  
 So the lowly lowdensity original PC FDD card used DMA and the PCAT
 HDD controller doesnt  That makes real sense
