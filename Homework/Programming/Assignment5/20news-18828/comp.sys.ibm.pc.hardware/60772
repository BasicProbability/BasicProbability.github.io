Subject Monitors close to AC power source  is this ok


I have a new monitor which I set up approximately 34 feet from 
where the AC power enters my house  at my fuse box 

Is this safe for the monitor or willcan the EMF emitted by the AC current eventually affect my monitor  If so how and is the 
damage permanent or would degaussing fix it

Thanks
