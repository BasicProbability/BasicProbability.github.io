Subject DataSave Videostreamer

 A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine ct
about a socalled Videostreamer This is an interface
between a PCs parallel port and any videorecorder for
backing up your data on a videotape The company DataSave
claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape
                         

It costs DM 250 about USD 200 I think

My question is
 Does anybody use this product if yes how many bytes 
 REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape 7 GB sounds quite
 unbelievable to me 

However any comments on the interface are appreciated
Please mail your replies directly to me I will sum up
if neccesary Thanks in advance
