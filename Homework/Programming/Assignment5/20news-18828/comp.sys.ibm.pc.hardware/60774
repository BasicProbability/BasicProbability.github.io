Just poke out the little pins in the connector and then replace them in
the correct slots
 
Is this reverisible  You can unpoke as easy as you poke
 

Well I tried this method based on responses from several people  Either
I am a klutzprobable or they have changed the connector  I ended up having
to destroy the connector put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and 
then plug them into the SB connector in the correct order  It works great 
this way so this turned out just fine  It certainly sounded easy based on
other peoples experiences but my attempts did not go too well
