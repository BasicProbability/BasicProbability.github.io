Subject Re Parity Error  System Halted anyone have any ideas

You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error
Checking enabled or disabled  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error
when its enabled and not when its disabled  How high will the count go on
the memory check at bootup before this error occurs  Does the system beep
at all if so whats the pattern of beeps  The error could be occuring in
Cache memory not so likely or video memory as well as the simms

The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board
manufacturer either  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies
among others that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
simm sockets to make your board  I tend to doubt your problem is with your
IDE controller also

Anyway perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better
