 Hello

 Ive got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card but lacking suitable drivers
 for windows 31 The drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible
 Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers Address for an
 ftpsite would be nice 

 Thanks in advance

 Jouni

You can find the drivers at wuarchivewustledu in the msdoswindows3 sub
directory  I think the files are called tvgawin31azip and tvgawin31bzip
Those are the latest drivers available as far as I know
