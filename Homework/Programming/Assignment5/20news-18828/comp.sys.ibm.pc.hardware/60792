 This may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the
 claim that a CPU will get hotter when a computationally intensive 
 job is running My friend claims that there will be little difference
 in the temperature of an idle CPU and a CPU running a computationally
 intensive job

It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing

Im not sure about DOS but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this


loop
	is there anything to do
		YES  do it goto loop
		NO   goto loop


The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions

Ive done some ASIC and digital design but not any CPU design
It would seem to me that on a 486 the FPU is not being used most of
the cache is not being accessed the off chip buffersdrivers are idle
the multiplier isnt multiplying the barrel shifters arent shifting
microcode isnt microcoding etc  This means transistors arent
switching which means less power dissipated in CMOS which means
less heat

From what I understand the Pentium shuts down those sections of the
CPU which arent being used in order to cut down on heatpower

dlouucsdedu           Then Id be crazy to think any other way
