Has anyone successfully put both SCSI and IDE hard drives
on the same system

I would like to know as well since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE
drive and want to add it to my computer a fouryearold Gateway
38620 which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive  The SCSI
controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS
setup ie both hard drive settings are listed as Not installed
and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders  I wondering if
this is a problem  Also I remember how when I helped my cousin
install his second IDE drive we had to define a masterslave
relationship for them do I need to do something similar here

I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the boot drive

Same here

Any help would be appreciated since I intend to install this drive
ASAP Id like to know what to do and what not to do before I start
Thanks
