Subject 386 Motherboard advice needed

Hi

Does anyone have a source for 386DX25 Motherboards  Ive
been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
to be only stocking the 386DX3340 or 386SX2533 motherboards

How difficult is it to modify a 386DX40 motherboard to run at
25 MHz  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
slower part

Thanks

Peter
