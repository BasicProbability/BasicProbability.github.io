 1 What is a 16550 UART

I dont know the exact meaning of UART but I think it is something like
Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter Normally the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 UART on board Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer so  with the
right software installed  it generates an IRQ every 16 chars 

 2 What does it do for highspeed modems
 3 Is it necessary for 144k or higher throughput

If you ran dos you dont need a 16550 because dos runs only ONE task at a
time and the whole cpupower could be used for the transfer But if you are
running a multitasking OS such as OS2 Unix etc  windows    the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task 

The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts

 4 Is it only for internal modems

NO The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the UART on board

 If you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems please
 let me know what you think  Also any particular brand name reccomended
 or will a cheapo clone do just a well

I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 40 Im very satisfied
with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem
