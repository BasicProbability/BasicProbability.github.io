 Trying to establish a network LAN here that could use 2 different printers
 Panasonic KXP2124 for printing receipts and Okidata OL400 for letters etc
 Is it at all possible in this world 

This is a fundamental aspect of Novells business they wouldnt be
where they are if they didnt live up to their Novell Does Printing
slogan  We run 6 printers of varying types off our Novell network
Im sure there are places with hundreds

RTFM on the CAPTURE command PRINTCON PSERVER and the sections of
the Windows 31 manual which cover network printing  If you havent bought
Novells products yet rephrase your question and look for information about
how well various competitors do printing
