Recently I have been getting a CMOS Checksum error when I first turn on my
computer  It doesnt happen everytime I turn it on nor can I predict when it
is going to happen  I have an AMI BIOS and all of the setting are lost for
example the drive types and the password options  However the date and time
remain correct  If anyone knows what can be causing this please let me know

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing  this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong along with most other of the CMOS data Try 
replacing the battery

If however your PC doesnt use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery If this isnt possible make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day this will keep the capacitor 
charged Id opt for the battery change though

Its also possible but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS If your battery seems okay get a virus scanner and
check out your system
