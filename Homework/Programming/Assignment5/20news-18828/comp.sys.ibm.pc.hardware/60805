Hi there  We just bought a 486 DX266 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI
Ultra Pro video card  Everything seems to work fine except for the
Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup
and within minutes of use everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible  Naturally I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this  The technician asked me about the drivers and I told him it
was version 15 build 59  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
	This is pure bull  Ive had the 24 bit mode 640x480 and 800x600
	working since the version before 59 55  Bld 59 added 
	the 24 bit option to Flexpanel  Try getting the drivers from 
	ftpcicaindianaedu or wuarchive
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work  Is this true  If so Im simply
amazed  How could this be  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here unless the subject has made the FAQ
