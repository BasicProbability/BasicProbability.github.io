 What a weekend   I replaced my motherboard upgraded to DOS 6 MS
 Windows 31 and now experience lockups in any windows application using the
 modem
 
        386DXDXL40 CPU  AMD
        AMI BIOS
        IO card with 2 serial 1 parallel and 1 game ports generic cheapo
        IDE controller two HD two FD
        internal packard bell 2400 modem
        mouse
 
 The mouse is set to COM1 IRQ4 via jumper on the IO board and parms on the
 mouse driver The modem is set to COM2 IRQ3 jumpers on modem board In
 addition I think I have disabled the second serial port on the IO card since
 it is unused Mouse works fine
 
 Heres the deal Procomm DOS version works fine through the modem
                  Procomm for Windows CIM Compuserve for windows and
                      Terminal all lockup when I try to do anything with the
                      modem The screen just freezes no sound comes from the
                      modem nor any messages on the screen
 
 Im getting REAL frustrated Could the second port on the IO card still be
 enabled Would this cause a problem Ive been through most of the software
 routes so Im beggining to believe that maybe this is a hardware problem
 Anybody been through a similar experience Anybody have any ideas I could try
 Please
 
 Thanks in advance

I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
modem Any time I give the modem a reset command ATZ while in windows
The computer locks up If I give the ATZ command in DOS it will work My solution 
was to not give the modem the ATZ command thru windows In the PROCOMM 
install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem ATZ
was not included in the initialization string  it works fine I called MS
about this  they didnt have a clue as to what the memoryinterupt conflict 
could be The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ
command
