  Gateway 2000 has released a new Flash BIOS update for their local bus systems 
  Because Im such a nice person I uploaded them to wuarchivewustledu  Look
  for glb05exe in the msdosuploads section  Enjoy
  
 
 I have several questions
 
 1 What do I gain with this new BIOS
 
 2 How can I save a copy of my old BIOS in case I want to go back
 
 3 How do I install the new BIOS
 
 Id like to enjoy but need answers first

1 It fixes some problems with MicroProse games  After leaving F15 III it
would in vain try to find a floppy in drive A  This has been fixed  I
dont know what other corrections were made

2 It comes with an image of the original in case things dont work

3 Download glb05exe  Format a bootable floppy disk and dont put a
configsys or autoexecbat  Run the self extracting archive so all the files
explode to the disk  Run the file fshexe  It should be selfexplanatory from
there

Dan

PS  I was feeling extraordinarily generous once again so I uploaded the
file to ftpcicaindiana too
