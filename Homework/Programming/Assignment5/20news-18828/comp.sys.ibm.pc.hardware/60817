Subject Re DOS 60

   I have a 386DX clone with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba 660
mbyte
drive Since installing DOS 60 when I tried to reinstall software
from
5 14 or 3 12 disks when I mount the secondthirdfourth disks DOS
6
doesnt recognize that I have changed floppies If I do a DIR I see
the
contents of the previous diskette The only way to get DOS to recognize
that
diskettes have changed is to do a label and then to not label them

   Buying DOS 60 has been a colossal mistake DOS 50 was stable and
worked
well with my equipment I have Superstor Pro and DESQVIEWX  with
QEMM 
Manifest etc so there arent any features of DOS 6 that I am using I
guess
I should roll back to DOS 50 but I am wary of what will happen when I
do it

   Besides like a fool I dont have a DOS 5 bootable disk anymore
Ive
made the same mistakes I caution my users not to make Like sheep I
joined 
the crowd flocking to DOS 6 Baaa Baaad system administrator
