Subject WANTED Floppy controller that can handle multiple floppies

I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks 35 and ideally would like to
be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single PC
Yes I know that services to do this exist 

I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
at a time I know that some controllers are available that can handle 4 
floppies with serialized access I know that microchannel machines can keep 
more than one floppy active simultaneously But does anyone have a controller 
for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going
How about for an EISA machine

If the limitation is a software limitation I can work around that by using
OS2 13 on my PC286

New or used Im interested
