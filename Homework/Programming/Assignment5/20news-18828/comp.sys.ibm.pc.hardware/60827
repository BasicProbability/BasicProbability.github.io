Subject SCSI and IDE Whats the difference

Stupid question from a new IBM PC user

Im going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000

What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD

The GW 486DX33V comes with a 250MB Western Digital IDE drive
I asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive

The guy asked me Why are you going with SCSI  I was lost for an answer
I just said I know Seagate better as a company from a satisfaction point
of view

Are SCSI drives faster than IDE  Im not buying my GW for another 4 months
or so but this is a question that has bugged me for a while
