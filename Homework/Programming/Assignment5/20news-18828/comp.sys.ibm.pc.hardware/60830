Subject Ive lost COM4   Help

I have a 386 clone and an internal modem set to COM4
It worked fine until I upgraded to DOS 60 and at the
same time reloaded Windows 31  Now the system cant
find COM4 MSD says COM4 is NA and three of my
four comm programs say hardware not present or some
similar error message  Procomm however finds the modem
no problem and works fine  Curiouser and curiouser  Any
hintshelp  Thanks
