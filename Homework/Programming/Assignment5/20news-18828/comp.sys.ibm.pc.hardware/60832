Subject Jumper settings for UngermannBass PCNIC Ethernet card

Does anybody have a datasheet handly for the abovementioned card  I
bought one sans manual at a local surplus shop and want to try it out
with the Crywyr packet driver suite  

The IRQ and interfaceselect jumpers are pretty straightforward but I
dont grok the settings of W10W18 also labelled A15 through A18
Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond
to what IO addresses

Is there anything else about this card I should know before I
plugplay
