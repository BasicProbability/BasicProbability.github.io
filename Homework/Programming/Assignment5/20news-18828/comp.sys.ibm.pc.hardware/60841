 LH Hello I am trying to hook an Apple Imagewriter to my IBM Clone
 LH I seem to have a problem configuring my lpt port to accept this  How
 LH can you adjust baud parity etc to fit the system  I tried MODE but
 LH it did not work  If anyone can help post of email  Thanx

LPT ports dont recognize baud parity etc settings  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port  Try this attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings  Try

CMODE COM19600N81

to set the port parameters  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT1 like this

CMODE LPT1COM1

This should work  Good luck
