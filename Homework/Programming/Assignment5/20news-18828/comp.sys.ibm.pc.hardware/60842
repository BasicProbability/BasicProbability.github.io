 On 042193  0430 Michael Shapiro had the unmitigated gall to say this

 MS The DOS system date has a twentyfour hour clock and a rollover bit
 MS When the system crosses midnight the rollover bit is turned on  
 MS Subsequent reads of the time add one  Theres no change possible

 MS This information was current up through DOS 33  Ive not checked to
 MS see whether it applies to later versions

Just a small tidbit with the advent of DOS 33 and later versions MS added
a small feature to the DOS time function  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock
