 RG This may be a dumb question but I need to put a hard drive on my
 RG fathers PCXT either MFM RLL or IDE I know how to hook it up but
 RG how do I tell the computer the geometry of the drive On my 386 you
 RG set it in the BIOS but I doubt thats how its done on an XT I

Most XT IDE controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer  The controller may
come with software to update its onboard BIOS or may be designed to work
with a particular drive  Seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on XTs and these are tailored to the drive

Also you cannot lowlevel format an IDE drive  The lowlevel format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called servos not
like the electronic use of the term that need a higher recording bias than
the drives recording heads can generate  Dont try to lowlevel format an
IDE drive
