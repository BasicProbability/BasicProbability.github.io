Subject Where can i buy a bios

 On 042193  0451 Ikos had the unmitigated gall to say this

 Ik Im in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 110 got a new hard
 Ik disk discovered my BIOS doesnt have a type 47 and I would like
 Ik know where I can purchase one of these things

Call Phoenix  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 38620 to an IDE drive

Also if you are installing an IDE drive and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drives volume try using it  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drives actual
size  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically in
most cases

WARNING  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive  A smaller setting will not harm the drive but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over  Drive damage will not
result but headaches will
