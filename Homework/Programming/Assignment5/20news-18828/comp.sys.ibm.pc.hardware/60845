Subject modems and noisy lines

 On 041993  0356 Juan Carlos Leon had the unmitigated gall to say this

 JCL I just got a problem I have a cheapo 2400bps modem which I use to
 JCL connect to my university but I get too much garbage on the screen I
 JCL do know its because the noise in the line I can actually hear it 
 JCL So my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate
 JCL this garbage my modem doesnt have any of these on hardware can a
 JCL software implemented protocol do the trick

There is a software version of MNP5 available from MTEZ and it will often
connect with other modems that are MNP compatible but if the modem that you
are connecting to doesnt support MNP then it wont help  Error correcting
modems will eliminate line noise but only id there are error correcting
modems on both ends of the conncetion  The added soeed is much worth the
price of error correcting modems  9600 baud V42bis modems are very
reasonable and they are only about 15 slower than the more expensive
14400 modems on the market
