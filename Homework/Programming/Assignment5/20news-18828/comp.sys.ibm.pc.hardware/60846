 On 042093  2156 Tim King had the unmitigated gall to say this

 TK accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
 TK box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up rather than getting
 TK the Nonsystem diskette message the machine hangs and the CMOS
 TK gets overwritten luckily Gateway sends a print of the standard

Just a wild thought here but how about this there is a small boot program
on every formatted diskette whether or not it contains system files  It is
this small program that prints the NonSystem Disk error not DOS  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is
nonstandard on the Gateway then it could clear the BIOS

I dont think that the BIOS is overwritten there is usually a small routine
to clear the CMOS area in case an invalid configuration prevents the
machine from booting  I think that the boot code on the Fuji disks may
inadvertantly call this routine

Just a thought

 Dont hit me Mr Moderator Ill go back on topic I swear
