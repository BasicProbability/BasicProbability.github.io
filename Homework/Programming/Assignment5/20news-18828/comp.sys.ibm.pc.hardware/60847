Subject Com ports 58

 On 042193  0454 Mark had the unmitigated gall to say this

 Ma Does anyone know what the standard port addresses are for COM ports 5
 Ma through 8 If there is a standard of any sort

There are no standards for PC COM ports above COM2  While there are de
facto standards for COM 34 they are not guarenteed to work  The PS2 can
use up to 8 ports I think but I dont know the specs  Good luck

 I tried to contain myself but I escaped
