Hi all

Ive been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several
terms that Im not sure about

1 Hard SectoredSoft Sectored  Whats the difference  How do I know
which to use

2 Head Skew  Cylinder Skew  I understand that these are related to
performance How do I know whats optimal

My drive is an ESDI drive if that makes a difference in discussing
these terms
