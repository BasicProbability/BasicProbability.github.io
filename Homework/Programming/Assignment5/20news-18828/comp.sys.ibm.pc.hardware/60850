Subject 66DX2 ISAVLB xor 50DX EISA   Advice wanted


Hi

I need some advice opinions regarding which PC would best suit my needs
I want to use this proposed beast for basically four things  

     	Editing documents using WordPerfect 51 under dos

     	Creating graphsanalyzing data using Sigmaplot V50 under dos

     	Editingplaying with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under 
	Windows 31  these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bitspixel

     	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqViewX 11 and Sun PCNFS 
	talking to our network of Sparcstations  this is where a lot of
	the imagesdata come from and is the most demanding of these tasks

Ive read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup
and decided that a nice system priceperformance would be

	486DX50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus
	15 monitor 1280x1024 NI
	3Com Etherlink III 16bit
	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive

However the parts dont fit  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
together only to discover that the ATI card wouldnt run at 50MHz  surprise
surprise  Actually after reading this group Im surprised that they even
have a 50MHz local bus running

I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX266 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX50 with EISA and no VLB and thus
the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
that Im primarily interested in the last two tasks  

Any help would be greatly appreciated  I need to decide quickly so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more



BTW We have a system now to perform these tasks it has the following 
configuration

	486DX33 64k cache ISA 8 meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra 2 meg ram
	14 monitor 1024x768 NI
	SMC Ethercard 8 bit
	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive

Were quite happy with the ATI card  very fast ONCE the data gets to it
Slow repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or
been uncovered  

There doesnt seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqViewX  Its sluggish
running the local window manager  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take
a long time even when the images fit entirely in ram

Theres not enough memory in the system  DesqViewX and a 1 meg SmartDrive
dont leave much room for other apps  Photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images

I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates  This
machine sustains only 120ksec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600ksec 
on the same network  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases
transfer rates to 160ksec  still very slow especially when moving large 
images  Is there such a thing as a localbus ethernet card coming  Will it
make a difference  Im hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX266 choice 
above for that reason

Also are there DX2100s on the horizon  What about DX399s  DX3150s 

Any information is greatly appreciated
