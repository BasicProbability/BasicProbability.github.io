Subject Re 35 floppy only reads what IT wrote

In article 1434netxcomnetxcom pdressnenetxcomnetxcom Peter Dressner writes
I have a Gateway with a 35 floppy The drive only reads files it
wrote to the floppy Floppies that have been formatted and 
contain files from other machines are unreadable Also 35 floppies
that were written by this defective floppy drive a long time ago are
also unreadable

This sounds like a head alignment problem How does one go about
fixing it Are there alignment screws that you can adjust

Thanks in advance for your responses

Peter

A friend of mine had the same problem it turned out that his floppy was
set up as a 5 14 12Mb drive instead of 35 144Mb

might help
