Subject Re How hot should the cpu be

The temp on my 486DX266 is over 96C measured with a Ktype thermocouple 
and Fluke 55 dig thermometer  This is an idle temp  not doing lots of
bus io not doing floating point not doing 32bit protected mode etc  This
is in a Micron computer without heatsink

I recently put a heatsinkfan on the chip but I might take the fan off  It
makes a horrible whine at times and I wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc
