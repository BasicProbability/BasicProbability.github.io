Hi

Does anyone have a source for 386DX25 Motherboards  Ive
been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
to be only stocking the 386DX3340 or 386SX2533 motherboards

How difficult is it to modify a 386DX40 motherboard to run at
25 MHz  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
slower part

Thanks

Peter

I know you work at sun but thats really no reason not to like fast 
computers I suspect a conspiracy here Are you trying to drag Intel through 
the mud at a con or something I really wish you guys would make your own 
computers faster instead of degrading others Why dont you go straight for 
the top and run a pentium at 07 MHz while youre at it

Seriously though Why in the bleeding hell do you want a 38640 to run at 
25MHz

Insert smiley where appropriate
