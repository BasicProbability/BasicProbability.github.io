Subject Question about IRQ2 and IRQ9

I have an 8bit serial card with two ports  Each port has the option of
using IRQ 234 or 5  I also have two serial ports on a multiIO card
and the ports can be set to IRQ 3457 or 9  From other posts Ive read
I get the impression that IRQ2 on the 8bit card is the same as IRQ9 on
the multiIO card  Am I right
