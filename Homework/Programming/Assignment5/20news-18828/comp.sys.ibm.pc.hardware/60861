Im in the market to upgrade my BIOS to a Phoenix 110 got a new hard disk
discovered my BIOS doesnt have a type 47 and I would like know where I
can purchase one of these things

So can anybody help me out on this quest

Pick up a copy of PC Magazine or Byte and look in the classifieds and
smallprint ads in the back There are a handful of shops that specialize
in BIOS upgrades
