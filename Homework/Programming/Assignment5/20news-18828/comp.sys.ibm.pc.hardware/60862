This may be a dumb question but I need to put a hard drive on my fathers
PCXT either MFM RLL or IDE I know how to hook it up but how do I tell
the computer the geometry of the drive On my 386 you set it in the BIOS but
I doubt thats how its done on an XT I thought it might be software with
the controller card but the IDE card for XTs that I saw didnt come with
any Also how do I low level format it once its on the computer Assuming
a drive which needs formatting

Since there is no BIOS support for ST506 interface hard disks in an XT
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the MFMRLL hard disk
controller Usually the controller has a ROMbased low level format
program a common jump address is C8000005  you can type GC8005 from
debug to see and a small table of drive geometries it knows about
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu Failing that you must use a
thirdparty HD prep program like SpeedStor Disk Manager or the like

IDE drives come formatted already and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself concerns about geometry are irrelevant Plug
it in and go to FDISK
