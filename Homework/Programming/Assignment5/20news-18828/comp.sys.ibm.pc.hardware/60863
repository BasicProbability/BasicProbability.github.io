Subject CDROM drive help

Hello All

I recently acquired a CDROM drive a Mitsumi mfg Feb93   Hey it
was free        Im quite pleased with the performance but it seems
to crash a lot when I use PLAYCDEXE that came with it a DESQview 231 
Thoughts  This mainly happens when my BBS is running in the background and
I load the program up If I load the program it doesnt crash and I start
the disk stop the program and start the BBS its OK but otherwise I have
big problems IE they can only be solved with a cold boot

If anybody can mail me to help me I would be eternally grateful 
unfortunately my feed to this group is a little unreliable so I would appreciate
 if you could mail but by all means post it too because Im sure somebody else 
 would like to know

Cheers
Wes
