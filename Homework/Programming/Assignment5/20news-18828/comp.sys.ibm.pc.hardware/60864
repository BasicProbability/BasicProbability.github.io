   Hi
       I am buying a Quantum LPS240AT 245 MB hardisk and is deciding a
       HDDFDD controller Is 32bit VLbus HDDFDD controller faster 
       than 16 bit IDE HDDFDD controller card

No VLbus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus and if
you hook it to VLbus itll work as fast as the slower of the two
meaning ISA speed

Its not true  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its IDE bus signal timing
doesnt have to be same to ISA signal timing  My VLIDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 33MBsec up to 83MB
sec the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 33
milion bytesec and 83 milion bytesec respectively   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 83MBsec on the ISA bus

       I hear that
       the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller

On the other hand I wouldnt expect it to be slower

OS2 20 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along
