Subject helpsecond hd install



I am considering adding to my 386 system equipped with a 130meg Maxtor 
HD a second Maxtor 245 Meg HD  I assume this will not be a problem 
However I remember reading somewhere that to do this you needed to 
reformat your original drive   Is this true   If so why   My drive is 
full and I really dont like the idea of to reinstalling everything 
from floppy

    Please Email me or post to the group
