Subject Perstor System Disk Controller information needed



Does anybody out there have or used to have an HD controller from
Perstor System Inc which is out of business I believe  My friend
received an old PC which happens to have such a controller and I am
having a hard time trying to add another HD to the card


I believe the controller is supposed to control MFM drives as RLL
drives 


Here the model info on the card but any other similar model will
probably do



Perstor System Inc
Model PS 18016FN
Rev 22 ECN 921


I would appreciate your reply directly to my email address below



Thanks
