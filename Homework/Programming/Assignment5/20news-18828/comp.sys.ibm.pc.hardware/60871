Subject Help choosing SCSI controler


I need to buy a SCSI controler for my 486 machine to use with a quantum  
425F harddrive I know that adaptec is good but they are kind of  
expensive Essentially I want a controller in the 100150 range that I
can use with this drive I plan to use Windows and later on OS 21 when it  
comes out Any reccomendations appreciated
