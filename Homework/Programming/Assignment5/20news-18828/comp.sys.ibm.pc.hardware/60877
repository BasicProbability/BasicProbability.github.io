Subject Re 17 Monitors

In article C5pIswKq8csmcgillca gerardiscsmcgillca The GIF Emporium writes
 NEC 5FG or now also available the NEC 5FGe  only difference
no ACCUCOLOR   Any experiences or opinions from people who have used
the NEC 5FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right after
my exams are all done ie about a week from now

	I have a 5FG and think it is great I havent seen the Nanaos so I
cant compare but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is
extremely good Ive used other Trinitron monitors eg a Sun SS2 color
monitors which is a 19 Trinitron and think the 5FG is at least as good
perhaps brighter and has none of these silly horizontal lines running across
	BTW I could be wrong but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well
as missing ACCUCOLOR It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG
can
