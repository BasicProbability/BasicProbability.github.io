Subject speed LEDs for a gateway motherboard


Hi

I recently got a towercase for my Gateway 48633 file server mostly because
we needed the extra drive bays and better power supply  This case has LEDs
for the processor speed ie 33  Is there a place to plug this in on the
motherboard  If not is there anyway to hack something to make it work

TIA

Eric
