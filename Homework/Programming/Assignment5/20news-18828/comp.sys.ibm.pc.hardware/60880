 There is a software version of MNP5 available from MTEZ and it will often
 connect with other modems that are MNP compatible but if the modem that you
 are connecting to doesnt support MNP then it wont help  Error correcting
 modems will eliminate line noise but only id there are error correcting
 modems on both ends of the conncetion  The added soeed is much worth the
 price of error correcting modems  9600 baud V42bis modems are very
 reasonable and they are only about 15 slower than the more expensive
 14400 modems on the market

What is MTEZ A dealer A repository Any details
