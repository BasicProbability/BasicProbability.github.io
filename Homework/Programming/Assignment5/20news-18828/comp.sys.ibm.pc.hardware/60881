NPJust got a 66MHz 486DX2 system and am considering getting a fan for the
NPCPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a
NPfairly good idea long ago when I did some electronics training I read
NPsomewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctionsgates etc
NPslowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature hence a hot
NPchip goes offspec sooner

NPHas anyone out there got a CPU fan

I work for a small PC OEM We offer both a personal and professional
system line Our 486 pro machines always have a CPU cooling fan on DX2
and DX50 units

NPIs there more than 1 type

There are several manufacturers

NPDo you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan

Sometimes  depends on the specific fan model

NPDo all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines

All the ones Ive seen do many come with a Y connector so you dont
have to have a spare connector

NPAnyone had any trouble with CPU fans

None

NPDoes anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of
money

Touch a 486DX50 chip after its been running a few minutes  you wont
feel the fan is a waste

NPHow are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese

Depends on the model Many use clips  make sure you use heat sink
grease or heat transfering tape or you will have wasted your money

NPRoughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to
without an advert Ive read claims 85F vs 185F

Tough to tell  I do know the chip sheds a lot of heat
