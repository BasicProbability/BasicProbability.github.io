Subject Re Problems with Toshiba 3401 CDROM

Hi
	I recently purchased the Toshiba 3401 CDROM  I own an Adaptec 1542B
SCSI card and I have so far failed to get the CDROM to work under DOS  It
works very well under OS2 so I know that the drive is not faulty
In my configsys I have aspi3dossys aspidisksys aspicdsys  In my 
autoexecbat I have MSCDEX which came with DOS 60  MSCDEX seems to find
and install the drive as drive F but when I switch to that drive and try a
dir I get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
like that  The CDROM is locked too and the adaptec utilities dont seem to
recognize that I have a CDROM at that point


The current Adaptec drivers do not support the Toshiba 3401  you should
get the Corel SCSI drivers which do support it

This is the method that I used and it works well

Corels phone number is 1613 7283733

Just a satisfied user
