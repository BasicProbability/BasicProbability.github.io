 I want to use this proposed beast for basically four things  

      	Editing documents using WordPerfect 51 under dos

      	Creating graphsanalyzing data using Sigmaplot V50 under dos

      	Editingplaying with images using Aldus PhotoStyler running under 
 	Windows 31  these images can be large say 2k x 2k 24bitspixel

      	Using the PC as an Xterminal running DesqViewX 11 and Sun PCNFS 
 	talking to our network of Sparcstations  this is where a lot of
 	the imagesdata come from and is the most demanding of these tasks

 Ive read read read PC magazines performed benchmarks read this newsgroup
 and decided that a nice system priceperformance would be

 	486DX50 256k cache ISA VLB 16meg ram
 	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 2 meg ram local bus
 	15 monitor 1280x1024 NI
 	3Com Etherlink III 16bit
 	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive

 However the parts dont fit  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
 together only to discover that the ATI card wouldnt run at 50MHz  surprise
 surprise  Actually after reading this group Im surprised that they even
 have a 50MHz local bus running

 I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
 486DX266 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX50 with EISA and no VLB and thus
 the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
 that Im primarily interested in the last two tasks  

Having in mind the size of the images my opinion is to go with VLB
It has much more bandwith that EISA which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card I have not made measures so someone else may
share experience on that

Also the DX266 is faster in the operations that run off internal
cache slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory
So my advice is the 66VLB

 Were quite happy with the ATI card  very fast ONCE the data gets to it
 Slow repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen or
 been uncovered  

 There doesnt seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqViewX  Its sluggish
 running the local window manager  Also many functions under PhotoStyler take
 a long time even when the images fit entirely in ram

 Theres not enough memory in the system  DesqViewX and a 1 meg SmartDrive
 dont leave much room for other apps  Photostyler will page to disk with
 medium size images

Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache No need to have
paging and cache both Well you might argue that the paging is
cached My belief no measurements is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrvexesys

 I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates  This
 machine sustains only 120ksec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600ksec 
 on the same network  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases
 transfer rates to 160ksec  still very slow especially when moving large 
 images  Is there such a thing as a localbus ethernet card coming  Will it
 make a difference  Im hoping so and leaning towards the 486DX266 choice 
 above for that reason

The bandwidth theoretical of ISA is over 5MBs which is far from
015MBs I tried my ISA IDE hard drive Maxtor 213MB and got the
same results  065MBs  regardless of the ISA bus speed
55825MHz So I guess that just the carddrivers combination is
lousy

 Also are there DX2100s on the horizon  What about DX399s  DX3150s 

The rumors are that DX399 if any is the most likely chip to come
out But note that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards so youll have to upgrade the MB

 Any information is greatly appreciated

Just some view not much figures
