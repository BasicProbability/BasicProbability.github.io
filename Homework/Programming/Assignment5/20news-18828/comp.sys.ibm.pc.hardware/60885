 So when youve got multitasking you want to increase performance by
 increasing the amount of overlapping you do
 
 One way is with DMA or bus mastering  Either of these make it
 possible for IO devices to move their data into and out of memory
 without interrupting the CPU  The alternative is for the CPU to move
 the data  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
 bus mastering
  
 How do you do busmastering on the ISA bus

As an earlier post noted  through DMA

 IDE however is defined by the standard AT interface
 created for the IBM PC AT which requires the CPU to move all the data
 bytes with no DMA

 If were talking ISA AT bus here then you can only have 1 DMA channel
 active at any one time presumably transferring data from a single device
 So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus explain how
 all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
 to the ISAAT bus at the same time

Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer If I have four sources of
DMA requests ready the DMA would service the one after the other If
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISADMA
bandwidth this will work

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller
