 SCSI1 SCSI2 controller chip also called SCSI2 8bit 46MBs with 
 10MBs burst  This is advertised as SCSI2 in BYTE 493159 FOR the
  PC and AT THESE SPEEDSNOT the Mac the PC
 

I have been following this mess for a while excuse my need for
clarification  Iam thinking seriously IDE vs SCSI and this thread
could not have come at a better time

the above quote SCSI1 SCSI2 controller chip

are we talking about a SCSI1 device eg HD on a SCSI2 Controller
or 
are we talking about a SCSI1 Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI2 controller board

thanks
