 Its an interesting idea but the worstcase data patterns developed to
 test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect
 common faults in memory chips
 
I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago
getting parity error  system halted error message in windows
I ran QAPLUS Check It Diagnose as well as several shareware
memory checkers I had a total of 8 meg SIMM in my system
these store bought shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldnt
place on a memory chip Out of exahperation I came up with
the now deleted steps to find bad memory chips I found 2
moral  never buy memory stamped not for sensitive or critical 
applications on the back
        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on Although it dodnt alleviate my parity error problems
in windows I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me and the commercial
shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is

ps man my typing stinks today and I dont feel like futzing around with 
this line editor
