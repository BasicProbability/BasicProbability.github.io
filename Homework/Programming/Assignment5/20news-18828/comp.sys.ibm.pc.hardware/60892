In a previous article cs3sd3aemaccsmcmasterca Holly       KS says

What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external and the
Sportster 14400 external I see that the price of a Sportster has dramatically
dropped to below 200 but the price of the Courier remains above 400

Anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a Courier

the Courier is their topoftheline product thus the higher price  Ive
never taken a real look at the Sportster line only Couriers but from what
Ive gathered its basically more of an entrylevel modem  probably
doesnt meet the same specifications that the Courier does  Im not sure
if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the more recent Courier
modems are so upgrades in the future may be an issue

again take all of the above with a grain of saltIve never evaluated
the Sportster so Im going by bits and pieces that Ive heard  if you
want a real answer post the question in compdcommodems and youll find
people who HAVE worked with the Sportster

personally though if I were going to look at the Courier modems Id
buy the Dual Standardthen Id get both HST and V32bis  in fact this
is exactly what I did    Im sitting here looking at my USR DS right
now

and now to correct a few VERY incorrect statements  folks if you want
to get reliable answers to modem andor UART questions post them to
compdcommodems  if you post in other groups you never know what youll
get in the way of an answer you may very well get a good answeror you
may get something like the one below  at least in cdm if someone posts
complete and utter bs youll see a flurry of folks correcting them to
avoid spreading faulty info

The Sportster at 144 has v42 error control and v42 bis data compression

just as it does at lower speeds too  there is absolutely nothing in
either CCITT Recommendation V42 or V42bis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running V32bis  V42bis of course is
currently only STANDARDIZED for operation on top of V42 in its primary
mode of operation LAPM but thats about as far as that goes

and just in case theres some confusion on this V42V42bis are also
supported by the Courier line unless you have a really ancient one

The difference
with the Courier is that it can run at 168 and only in the HST mode 

take a second look at the original question

In a previous article cs3sd3aemaccsmcmasterca Holly       KS says
What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external
                                                 
see the V32bis up there  the question was not about the Courier HST
modem or about the Courier Dual Standardit was about the Courier
V32bis modem  the modem in question does not support HST period  it
therefore does not support the 168 kb HST

also not all Courier HST  Courier Dual Standard modems support the 168 kb
version of HST  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 144 kb  there are
even older models that only run HST at 96 kb

This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of
the same type unit to achieve this speed

HST is USRs proprietary modulation scheme  but were not talking about
HST were talking about V32bis  V32bis is most definitely NOT a
proprietary modulation scheme

The Sportster will do
asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous  The HST is one way
only

I do hope you didnt mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way

first off V32 and V32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous  this is
part of the CCITT Recommendation ie part of the standard  it isnt a
feature unique to the Sportster I just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the Courier DS manual

second HST is not one way only  more correctly put it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme meaning it doesnt work at the same speed
in both directions  HST operates at 96  144  168 in one direction
and has a lowspeed backchannel in the other direction  the highspeed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow  this is fine if
youre logged on to say a BBS and type one letter and get screens of
info back transfer files not using bimodem etc  there is of course
a penalty for turnaround time when the highspeed channel needs to reverse
directions

V32 and V32bis are both symmetrical meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time

third synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetricalthey are two completely different topics

The HSTs will be upgradeable to the vfast spec when it is available

again more correctly put SOME of the Courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever Vfast is called when its complete  if you have the large
footprint Courier modems like I do youre SOL  there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety which
could eventually be upgraded to support Vfast but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem
