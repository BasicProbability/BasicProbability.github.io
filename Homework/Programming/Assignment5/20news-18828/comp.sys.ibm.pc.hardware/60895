Hello

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card the older version
with the DIP switches on the back  I have two problems

1  Ive lost the manual

2  I have it in a machine with a network card and
    everything works fine until I run windows when
    the network connection dies

    In case its important the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8Bit compatable card  Its IO
     address is 02E0 and its RAM base address is
     D000  Its also using IRQ 2

    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out but with no manual I dont
know the Bboard number

    If you can please help me with as many of the following
as possible

a  Send me the Diamond BBS number
b  Email or post the DIP switch settings for the card
    or fax them to me at 412 5218668
c  Tell me what Im doing wrong so I can magicly get
    everything working

    Any help at all would be much appreciated

                Thanks in advance

                       Red
