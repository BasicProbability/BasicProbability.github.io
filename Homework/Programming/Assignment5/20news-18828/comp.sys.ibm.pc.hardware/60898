Subject Q PCIP MIT How to get info and how to install


Netters

I have seen some postings on PCIP from MIT This package out of 1986
should be a full TCPIP fro the DOSmachines Is there anyone out there
thats using it

I want to connect a DOSmachine to my OS2 machine Tell me what the
DOSmachine should run sample CONFIG and AUTOEXEC would be great and
where I can find a nfs client I understand that a telnet and a ftp
client are part of the package

Ive got the Crynwr package drivers but thats it Please point me to
a good source of information if you cannot help me yourself

regards JV
