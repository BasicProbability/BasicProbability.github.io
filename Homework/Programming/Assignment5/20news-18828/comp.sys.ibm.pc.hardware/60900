Subject HELP LED connectors for motherboard


I bought a 386DX40 motherboard for 50 no documentation at all Everything
appears to work except Im having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors
working Ive looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards but the pin
configuration doesnt look anything like what is on this board Does this
pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there Any hints on where I
can find this information

                 1                 10
      speaker           
      keylock           
                 11               20
                       J23   
                             The board came with a jumper vertically across
                              these two pins

I can get the powerkeylock to work across pins 1115 reset across pins 9 and
19 but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation
The date on the board itself is 692 opti chips

I would really appreciate any help and thank you in advance
