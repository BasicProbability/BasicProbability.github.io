Hello

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card the older version
with the DIP switches on the back  I have two problems

1  Ive lost the manual

2  I have it in a machine with a network card and
    everything works fine until I run windows when
    the network connection dies

    In case its important the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8Bit compatable card  Its IO
     address is 02E0 and its RAM base address is
     D000  Its also using IRQ 2

REMAINDER DELETED

I dont have my copy of the manual with me right now but I can offer the
following in the interim

   1  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 which are NOT
       configurable  These addresses incidentally were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual

   2  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ 2 for CGA or EGA support
