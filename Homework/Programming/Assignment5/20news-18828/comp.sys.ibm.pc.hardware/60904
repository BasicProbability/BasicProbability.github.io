 While playing around with my Gateway 2000 localbus machine last
 night it became apparent that Windows 31 didnt give the option
 for 32bit access for virtual memory
 
 I am using a permanent swap file and the disk drive is on the local
 bus interface
 
 Is this expected or should I be investigating further why no 32bit
 option appears
 
 Thanks for any help
