OAKOaklandEdu is the primary mirror site for WSMRSIMTEL20ArmyMil
All other mirrors except wuarchive and all LISTSERV and TRICKLE
servers get their SIMTEL20 files from OAK instead of SIMTEL20 because
it is much faster and allows more simultaneous ftp connections  OAK is
always in sync with SIMTEL20 because I maintain it in addition to my
duties at SIMTEL20  I run OAKs mirror program whenever new files are
added at SIMTEL20
