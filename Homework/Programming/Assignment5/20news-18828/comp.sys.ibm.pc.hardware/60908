Subject HELP  EISA board configuration problems

I just bought a new AMIECU EISA motherboard and an Adaptec 1742A fastSCSI 
controller I wanted to install the AHA1742A and did as written in the
AMIECU manual But the CFGutility told me to get a newer version of the Adaptec 
configuration overlay file named adp0000ovr because the old one is not 
compatible to my motherboard
The adaptec driver utility is version 30

       CAN YOU HELP ME  PLEASE DO SO
