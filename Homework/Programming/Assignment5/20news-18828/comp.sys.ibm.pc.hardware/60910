I have been unable to get COM 4 to work  diagnostic programs such as msd show
nothing installed  I think the software options are OK  is there a known
hardware conflict andor workaround for this problemand CD ROM
System is a G2K 486DX266 tower with ATI video card

Its the video card  Its 8514A compatible which means it uses the
same io addresses as com4
