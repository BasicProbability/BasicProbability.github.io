Subject Monitors  Nanao

Hello Ive been following discussions on 17 monitors in 
compsysibmpchardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews  Im interested in getting more information about Nanaos products
as well as some others that may fit the bill   

I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI
Im envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 wa graphics
board like the Retina andor on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX  Basically
I want a high resolution versital monitor  This monitor need not be large
17 if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above  Ive been
very happy with a 16 on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home

Im interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Suns fairly often and look pretty
good to me at least  I havent seem them brought up in csiph very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic

Ok stuff Id like to find out  How can I get ahold of Nanao  What are
the products in their line  What are the technical specs  Esp what
scan freq and max resolutions can they handle  Whats list and street
cost  if avail from a third party and where can I get ahold of them 
Same info for Sony and Hitatchi

Thank you very much
