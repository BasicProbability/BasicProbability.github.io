Subject Re UNIX and DOS talking on QIC150 tapes

kdqquestUUCP Kevin D Quitt writes

I have a system with a SCSI drive  I want to get a QIC150 tape unit to
attach to it and then run software that will read and maybe even write
UNIX TAR tapes  Or at least just read a stream and dump it to file  Ill
take it from there

Why is this impossible

It isnt  

Use tar on the Unx box and gtak110zip on the DOS box Needs ASPI driver
