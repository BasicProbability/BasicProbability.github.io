Subject Kaypro 286 jumper settings

I received a Kaypro 286i computer DOS without a manual that 
describes the jumpers on the motherboard  It came with
640KB and I upd it to 1MB  But the computer or setup does not
recognize the extra 384K 

Does anyone know if this computer is capable of greater than 640K
on the main board and what jumpers are required to expand it to 1MB

Some specs
	Kaypro main board assy number 81621
	Phoenix BIOS v151 1985

Thanks in advance
Doug
