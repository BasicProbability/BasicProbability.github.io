Subject Always IN2000 decent

Ive got an IN2000 working in a wimpy 386SX20 presently  In a few
months Im getting a 486 motherboard and probably a Toshiba 3401e CDROM and
a SBPro

Will I need special drivers for getting all this to work  Do they exist
Basically is this feasible or should I expect to be getting a newer 
faster SCSI card

thanks
Bryan
