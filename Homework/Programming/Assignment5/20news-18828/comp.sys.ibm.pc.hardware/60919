Subject fooling check for existance of keyboard with resistor

Hi

I have the following problem I have to use a computer for special purposes
that doesnt have a monitor and keyboard connected No monitor isnt a 
program  but no keyboard
I cant disable the keyboard from BIOS setup in fact there is no setup
I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply
using a selfmade connector that connects two pins via a resistor
Pity pity I lost contact to the person before getting more detail
So does anyone of you experts can help

Thanks for any hints even vague ones 

Thomas
