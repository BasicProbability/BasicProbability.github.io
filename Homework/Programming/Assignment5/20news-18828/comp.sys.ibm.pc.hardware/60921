 int eh same article the PC would will get plug and play SCSI from the
 article it seems you get plug and play SCSI1 only since SCSI2 in FULL
 implimentation has TEN NOT 7 devices

I beleive this last bit is just plain wrong

I believe you are right  Both SCSI and SCSI2 support 8 devices on the bus
normally that would be the host controller and 7 targets each of which
may have up to 8 logical units LUNs
