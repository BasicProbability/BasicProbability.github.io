Subject dont have harddisk type 47 

Hello
a friend a mine has a commodore 386sx and weve put in that machine
a second harddisk he now has 100200 MB But the problem is that
the 200MB harddisk isnt supported in the bios Alas theres no user type
47 in the setup At the moment we use it as a 193MB type but there are
getting bad blocks on the harddisk  Question who knows a solution to this
Ive seen a small program for this once in the BYTE but I havent been able
to find this Would speedstor or diskmanager work for this I used these
programs quite a lot in the XTdays but I dont have these anymore Seagate
used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold
 
Help will be greatly appreciated
