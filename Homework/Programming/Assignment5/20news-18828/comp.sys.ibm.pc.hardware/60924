   Do hamsters have a natural habitat anymore ie wild hamsters Or does
their world consists only of a plastic gym that we call their home while they
call it hell Funny how we like to watch others sweat while our butts take
root on the sofa
   Im dont think hamsters sweat Ill go shave one and get back to you
