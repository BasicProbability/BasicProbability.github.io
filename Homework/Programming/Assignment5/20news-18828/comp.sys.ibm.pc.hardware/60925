Subject VGA card for fixedfrequency monitor


Has anyone connected a highres fixed frequency monitor to their PC
I have a mitubishi monitor that does 1024x768 at 60hz but wont do
any other resolutions  All the video cards designed for this sort of
thing are very expensive 400  Has anyone done it with an SVGA
card I know it can be done its just a question of getting the card
at the right resolution and frequency  Id like to use a mono
hercules monitor as my doscommand line monitor and switch to the
mitsu for Windows or Xwindows under Linux or 3BSD

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated  Email please

Thanks
