Subject Windows Virtual Memory


Ive got a 386DX40 4MB and Im using Windows 31 Sometimes I wondered why 
Windows worked endlessly on my HD when I was doing nothing execpt having lunch
or something like that Then I turned this virtual memory swapfile off and
Windows became quite faster but now having less memory free And so Im still
wondering why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the
convertional is sufficient Any commonsenseexplanation is really appreciated
