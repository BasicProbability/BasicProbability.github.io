Im using Norton Cache 50 which is really nice but horrible incompatible
Some games wont work it my streamer software wont work with it and Windows
doesnt like it at all But when copying or deleting lots of small files only
NCACHE is really fast You see to write a file the FAT must be changed But to
write 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once Is there any cache program
out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my
applications Any help is really appreciated
