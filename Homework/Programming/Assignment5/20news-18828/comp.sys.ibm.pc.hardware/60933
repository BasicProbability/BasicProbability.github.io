Subject DONT BUY FROM TC COMPUTERS  

Im planning to buy a computer and I like TCs ads   Can you tell anything
about the company and their computers  Also if anyone has a company they 
would prefer please let me know

Yes they are nice ads and even better great prices  But this is all on 
the outside  The consumer sees this and orders  Little do they know they 
will get POOR service very poor  When I ordered a 105mb hard drive from 
TC about 6 months ago I received it in the mail installed it and 
discovered it DIDNT WORK  I sent it back to them and they said theyd 
send me a refund check  IT TOOK MANY MANY MANY phone calls and hatemail 
as well as threats of lawsuit to get back my 25000  In fact it took TWO 
WHOLE MONTHS of calling and threatening  Every time Id call I would be 
put on the runaround until I finally wound up on an answering machine  Id 
leave my name and phone  but I didnt even get called back ONCE  I AM 
ONE PISSED OFF TC CUSTOMER 	AND IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF OR 
IF YOU WANT DECENT SERVICE DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY FROM THIS 
COMPANY  THE MONEY SAVED IS NOT WORTH THE ULCERS YOU WILL GET  PASS THIS 
WORD AROUND TO YOUR FRIENDS  		Companies like this do not deserve 
to stay in business so lets not give them out hard earned money  

Discount Micro Systems Powerhouse and Gateway 2000 all have given me 
excellent service and speed in the past  I highly recommend them to anyone
