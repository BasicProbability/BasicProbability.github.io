 Hi
 
 Does anyone have a source for 386DX25 Motherboards  Ive
 been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
 to be only stocking the 386DX3340 or 386SX2533 motherboards
 
 How difficult is it to modify a 386DX40 motherboard to run at
 25 MHz  Is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
 slower part
 
 Thanks
 
 Peter


This is normally the case but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator
as you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board
