 I am considering adding to my 386 system equipped with a 130meg Maxtor 
 HD a second Maxtor 245 Meg HD  I assume this will not be a problem 
 However I remember reading somewhere that to do this you needed to 
 reformat your original drive   Is this true   If so why   My drive is 
 full and I really dont like the idea of to reinstalling everything 
 from floppy
 
     Please Email me or post to the group

No you do not need to reformat your old HD
