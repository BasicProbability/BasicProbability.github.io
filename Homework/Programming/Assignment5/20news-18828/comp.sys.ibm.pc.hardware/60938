IBM Apple Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week as Motorola
Corp IBM and Apple Computer Inc detail the results of their yearlong
effort This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32bit
processor with a 64bit memory interface much like Intel Corps
Pentium with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle according to sources familiar with the chip Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50
SPECint89 marks respectively sources said Floatingpoint performance
for the 36volt processors will be even better as their SPECfp89
performance will be 60 and 80 respectively The 601 a scaleddown
version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS6000
workstations will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorolas 64bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in The chip which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture is bus independent so vendors could develop
PowerPC based systems using a number of different architectures
including ISA EISA or Sun Microsystems Incs Sbus design one source
noted

According to sources familiar with the development effort Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture despite a complex design made up of more than 28 million
transistors using a 06micron technology Initial chips are expected to
be priced from 300 to 400  only slightly higher than Intel Corps
486 processors  but could be sold profitably for less than 100 one
source said
