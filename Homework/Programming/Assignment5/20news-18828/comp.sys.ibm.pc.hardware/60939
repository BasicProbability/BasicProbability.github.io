are we talking about a SCSI1 device eg HD on a SCSI2 Controller
or          
are we talking about a SCSI1 Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI2 controller board
we are talking about a SCSI1 device eg HD on a SCSI2 Controller

Here is a rewrite of my Mac  Info sheet SCSI section
SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM
 Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card 
 expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CDROM  Normal asynchronous
 SCSI is 5 Mhz  fast synchronous SCSI is 10 Mhz  Difference between these
 modes is mainly in the software drivers
 Main problem  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end 
 Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM 
SCSI1  8bit 7 devices per SCSI controller  asynchronous 15MBs ave
 and synchronous 5MBs max transfers  8bit SCSI2 is often mistaken for
 a fast version of SCSI1 see SCSI2 for details
SCSI2 fully SCSI1 compliant SCSI2 mode  10 devices per SCSI controller
 8bit SCSI2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI1 since it can run using
 SCSI1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices which
 results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI1  16bit
 and 32bit SCSI2 require different ports electronics and SCSI software
 drivers from SCSI1 Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
 interfaces  32bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode hence term
 wide and fast SCSI Transfer speeds are 46MBs with 10MBs burst 8bit
 812MBs with 20MBs burst 16bit and 1520MBs with 40MBs burst
 32bit

8bit SCSI2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI2 
that I know of that can pump SCSI2 speeds through SCSI1 devices and software
controlers  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI2 at 10MBs maximum throughput for PCs  Since 8bit SCSI2 does NOT
NEED all the hardware including electonics and software of 16bit and 32bit
SCSI2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI2 interfaces  Just pop out the SCSI1
electornics and pop in 8bit SCSI2 electronics  Some people consider
16bit where SCSI2 REALLY starts I USED to be one of them but
46MBs average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MBs is NOT SCSI1
but is 8bit SCSI2
Rule of thumb if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MBs then it is SOME type of SCSI2

8bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI1 electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to 16 and 32bit SCSI2
