 Just got a 66MHz 486DX2 system and am considering getting a fan for the
 CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a
 fairly good idea long ago when I did some electronics training I read
 somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctionsgates etc
 slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature hence a hot
 chip goes offspec sooner
 
 Has anyone out there got a CPU fan
 Is there more than 1 type
 Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan
 Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines
 Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans
 Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of money
 How are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese
 Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to without
   an advert Ive read claims 85F vs 185F
 
 Any info appreciated

I own a PC FanCard II which is a slightly different beast  Its a long card
that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans  It requires
no extra cabling  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
heat  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
longer appears  Its supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of 7595 degrees Fahrenheit  According to the makers MS Tech
advertisements the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running
wo ac in Desert Storm  I cant vouch for that  However I am a satisfied
customer  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mailorder
