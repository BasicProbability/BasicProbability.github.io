Stupid question from a new IBM PC user

Im going to be selling my Mac and getting a Gateway 2000

retching noises  Talk about out of the frying pan and into the fire 
What CPU does this use  I need the info fro my Thesis

Are SCSI drives faster than IDE
Im pretty sure SCSI is faster  Along with a lot better compatability
Half right
SCSI1 is SLOWER than IDE 5MBs vs 83MBs maximum
SCSI2 8bit has a faster BURST rate than IDE Quarda
SCSI2 16 and 32BIT are MUCH faster than IDE Cyclone in June
