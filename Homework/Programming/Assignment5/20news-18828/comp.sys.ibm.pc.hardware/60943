Subject Re Modems and UARTs

Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter Normally the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 UART on board Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer so  with the
right software installed  it generates an IRQ every 16 chars 

  close Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter

 3 Is it necessary for 144k or higher throughput

If you ran dos you dont need a 16550 because dos runs only ONE task at a
time and the whole cpupower could be used for the transfer 

   Even if you are running DOS if your CPU cant handle the speed of the
interrupts you will still lose characters  I have one 28610 machine with
an external 9600 bps modem attached and cant drive the serial port any faster 
than 192k without losing characters
