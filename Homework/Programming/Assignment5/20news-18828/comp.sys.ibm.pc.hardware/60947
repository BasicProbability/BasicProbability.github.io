 I accidentally tried to low level format my Western Digital Caviar 280 drive
 Is there a public domain or shareware utility available that will allow 
 me to fix it
 
 Thanks
 
 I am no expert on this  But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives  When you  low level format it the information itself is gone as well I dont think you can get it back unless  you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you

Well I have a different story to recount  I attempted to lowlevel format a
WD 43MB disk about a year ago  When I understood my error I contacted WD
They told me that I hadnt hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMATS on it  It was fine  Also I understand that Western Digitals BBS
may have some lowlevel formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop
