 Im using Norton Cache 50 which is really nice but horrible incompatible
 Some games wont work it my streamer software wont work with it and Windows
 doesnt like it at all But when copying or deleting lots of small files only

Thats surprising  I havent seen any incompatibilities with mine
version 601  The version that came with my upgrade to 601 had some
problems but Symantec fixed those and Ive havent seen anything wrong
since

Im not running Windoze by the way
