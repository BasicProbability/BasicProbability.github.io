Why is it going to take a year for Vfast to become a standard Are there
technical problems to work out or is it just bureaucratic slowdown THANKS

Dont even get hyped up  They are still accepting submissions from the
members for various proposals of how to implement the standard

You dont seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
v32 which took years to pass implement and finally sell at a reasonable
price vfast requires all new technology not just faster DSP chips etc
to achieve its performance

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
after that
