 Have anybody succeded in converting a atari monomchrome monitor into a
 mono VGA monitor If so please let me know exactly how you did and what
 graphics card you used

 I wish I could help  I posted a similar question about two weeks ago
 I got no response at all  Ive asked locally at my friendly Atari store
 I was told that it should be possible but that they had no idea how
 it might be done  Nor did they particularly care to investigate

OK heres my results so far

1 You have to define the monitor as LCD  it doesnt really support
   Analogue video input It works but isnt very linear

2 The incoming sync pulses need inverting This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter
   If you dont know how to do it dont even contemplate it 

3 Itll only work in standard VGA mode

OK having said that Im trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge and doesnt care about the polarity outputting
the ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1 VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode theyre
   in  herc emulation is  while MVGA is  for example

2 It means I dont have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM Currently I have 3 Yes 3 monitors sitting on my desk
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paperwhite VGA
   will cut things down to 2 If I forget about Atari colour
   I can get down to 1

Ultimately the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor
but Im as pressed for cash as anyone else so itll have to wait
