Subject Trying to find a PC email network

   I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based email wide area network service
or the necessary network software to establish one myself While I am aware
there are various BBSs and other similar services avalible like Compuserve
Canada Remote Systems etc I require fairly specific criteria In 
approximate order of importance they are

1 The mailfilesnews are readwritten locally and batched to the network
   server ie no continuous online connectionNOTE all users are remote
   and will use modems over conventional phone lines

2 Simple The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge
   have never heard of Unix and have very little interest in learning It is
   essential that the client software is completely painfree

3 Cheap We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established
   commercial network just so we can send large files between members of the
   group  hence 1 In addition I would like the network server to be
   something small simple and inexpensive like a 486 There are only about
   40 people in the group so it is not a huge network

4 The capability for Internet access for newsmail

5 Internet style ids eg pwoodmathuwaterlooca


   If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing even if it
doesnt sastisfy all my criteria and I dont care where it is PLEASE PLEASE
email me and tell me about it We are not adverse to making alterations to
an existing system if necessary

Thanks
