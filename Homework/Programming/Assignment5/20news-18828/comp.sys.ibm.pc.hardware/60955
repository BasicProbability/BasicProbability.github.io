Subject Gateway 4DX33V  too high a price


I asked for opinions yesterday on Gateway machines All
the email I received indicated that they were solid
reliable machines and technical support was very good

Well Gateway faxed me a price sheet just now It seems
to be on the higher side but then again maybe not
Dells price for a similar price is a whole lot more
Is this a decent deal Please advise via email
