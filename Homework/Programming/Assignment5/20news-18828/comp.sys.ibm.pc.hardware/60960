I believe that any VLEISAISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24bit EISA DMA where real EISA DMA is 32bit  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA  For this
reason I would pass  I own one of these HAWK VLEISAISA and am look
ing to replace it for exactly this reason
Please doublecheck me on this  In other words call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32bit EISA
DMA
Other than this limitation the motherboard works quite well I am using
mine with DOS 5 Windows 31 and UNIX S5R32  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter

You are correct  The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says
that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks

I dont see this as a problem with the chipset a mistake I see this
as something that was designedin intentionally

So it would seem that to enhance the design from 24 to 32bit EISA DMA
would require an update to the chipset  An update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design

What Im saing is  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT 
along with a possible motherboard layout update  This is not simple
If I were you I would be cautious about this

You might look into the Advanced Integration Research AIR VLEISA
motherboard  All slots are EISAISA capable  2 or 3 of the slots are
VLbus capable  The AIR people confirmed this board supports real
32bit EISA DMA I called them  PentiumP5  capable  Less expensive
than equivalent AMI or Micronics VLEISA board

Look in Computer Shopper April 93  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother
board  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it  Im
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the
AIR board

Model number of AIR board with 48633DX is B433EI2  You can call
Motherboard Warehouse for example for a price  Phone s included

AIR                    4084280800
