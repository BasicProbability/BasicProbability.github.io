 You can find the drivers at wuarchivewustledu in the msdoswindows3 sub
 directory  I think the files are called tvgawin31azip and tvgawin31bzip
 Those are the latest drivers available as far as I know

I downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be
incompatible with this particular card None of the SVGA drivers worked
Theyre probably for the newer 8900 and 9000 series
