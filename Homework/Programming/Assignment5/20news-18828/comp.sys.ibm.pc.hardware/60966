I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX266 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX50 with EISA and no VLB and thus
the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
that Im primarily interested in the last two tasks  

The April 13 issue of PC Magazine published benchmarks for the ATI UltraPro
running on both VLB and EISA

	800x60016	800x600256	1024x76816	1024x768256

EISA	1534		1534		1519		1515
VLB	1602		1631		1633		1624
