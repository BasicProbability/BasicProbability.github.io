Subject BIOS timer interrupts

Hello
    Im trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts which occur every 055
seconds or 182 times a second to time peoples response times in a
psychology experiment and the response times are on the order of 01
seconds Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting
ticks Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently Im trying to do
this in DOS 50 on a 386 and it would be nice if this could also work
on our old 8086 machines running DOS 21 I know I know I dont like
them any more than you do but this is by no means a requirement just a
possibility 
    So basically any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the
related inrterruots would be appreciated as well as any information on
alternate ways of improving accuracy Email is preferred as Im
planning on posting this to a few boards and I dont read all of them
Thanks

Joe
