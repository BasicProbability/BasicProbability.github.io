Subject Re Help adding a SCSI Drive Can it coexist with an IDE

 First of all please edit your postings  Wading through 50 lines of
  quoted crud which people have already read makes people much less
  likely to help you  Of course if you dont want to be helped thats
  your problem   

 Is this true I was under the impression that people on the net had both  
 SCSI and IDE working together

     No its not true  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together but
there are restrictions at least with the Adaptec 1542

 You MUST boot from the IDE drive  There is no way to boot from the
  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives

 You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS Im not sure about this though
  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI
  drive  Hmm  I know that you have to disable something related to
  the SCSI BIOS but Im not sure if it is the ROM itself

     Back in February someone asked about IDE and SCSI this question
gets asked again and again  At the end of this message Ive included
an edited copy of my reply  You might find it interesting

 1  Is it worth it to get SCSI over IDE   Will there be a noticable
     decrease in access timeincrease in Xfer rate

     For MSDOS applications ISAbased SCSI and IDE controllers
generally have comparable throughput  You might get slightly higher
throughput with a SCSI disk but youll also pay more for the disk
30100 and up in some cases  Youll also pay much much more for a
good SCSI controller

     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if theyre
used with a good multitasking operating system like a PC Unix
Unfortunately neither MSDOS nor Windows 31 is a good multitasking
operating system  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is
mostly wasted with these which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage
However note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices

     If youre only going to be using MSDOS stick with IDE  Its
cheaper and youll have less headaches

 4  Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my
     harddrive bernoulli box CDrom Tape Drive etc

 Note the following is true for MSDOSWindows only  Who knows what
  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix 

     No  Generally you have to find drivers for each SCSI device
which probably dont exist unless youre using one of the betterhigh
performance SCSI controllers  These are typically busmastering SCSI
controllers that cost around 180400 street prices and up and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
namebrand SCSI devices either come with the card or can be purchased
for under 100 list price  Examples of such driver kits are

 Adaptecs EZ SCSI kit list 75  This works only with Adaptec SCSI
  controllers

 CorelSCSI from the same people who make CorelDRAW list 99 
  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card
  that has an ASPI driver like the Adaptec

     Central Points PC Tools for DOS 80 supports a number of SCSI tape
drives the documentation lists 40 tape drives  Unfortunately it
works only with Adaptec controllers

 5  Are there likely to be other problemsincompatibilities with a
     SCSI controller and  sound cardsvideo acceleratorsand similar
     equipment

     Yes you will run into problems if youre using a
highperformance busmastering SCSI controller  This doesnt sound
right doesnt it  Its true though  With one of these controllers
youll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards floppycontrollerbased tape drives like the CMS Jumbo 250 and
Windows 31  I know  Ive been to hll and back getting my SCSI
controller to work with various hardwaresoftware thank God for tape
backups  If you want a copy of my Adaptec 1542 hints and tips file
send email

     These problems arent really the fault of the SCSI controller card
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the PC eg no standards  However adding a busmastering SCSI card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible

     SCSI holds a lot of promise but you can run into a lot of PC
compatibility problems  If youre planning on using only MSDOSWindows
31 stick with IDE  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix youll
have to make some hard decisions a good SCSI controller and more than
one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance at the
possible cost of MSDOS compatibility   I say probably because
while I know this to be true with a PC Unix I dont know if this really
will be true of Windows NT  I suspect that it will but I dont know
for sure
