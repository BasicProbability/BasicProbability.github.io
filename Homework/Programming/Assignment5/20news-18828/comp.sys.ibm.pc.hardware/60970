Subject dos 40  dos 50  need new mouse driver

     I recently installed dos 50 on a few machines and the users 
claim that when they use the mouse often the screen will blank and
the machine will lock up

There are no viruses they are not running any TSRs
the mouse is a logitec 2 button

Anybody got any ideas

thanks
