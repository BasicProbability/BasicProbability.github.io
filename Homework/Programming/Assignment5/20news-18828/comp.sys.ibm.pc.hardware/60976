Subject Re Jumper settings for UngermannBass PCNIC Ethernet card

In article 1993Apr2121520418373ntgcom dplattntgcom Dave Platt writes
    The IRQ and interfaceselect jumpers are pretty straightforward but I
    dont grok the settings of W10W18 also labelled A15 through A18
    Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond
    to what IO addresses
    
The UB PCNIC also OEMed by IBM for a while is the only Ethernet card I
know of that doesnt use IO addresses  It only has interrupts and shared
memory  The jumpers you see control bits 1518 in the base address of the
shared memory  I cant recall which is 1 and which 0 but thats easy
to determine with DEBUG
