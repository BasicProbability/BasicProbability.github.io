 Specifically I am interested in the Ultrastor 34F VLB SCSI controller
 Before I shell out the bucks for this thing I would like to get the
 straight scoop from someone who knows  Does anyone have this controller
 Any problems with it

I had one and on three different motherboards it didnt work with NT and
in some cases DOS I sent mine back but it is my understanding that
on some systems such as Micronics motherboards it is necessary to
shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work

Ive yet to hear from someone running a 34F on any motherboard with
NT without shutting off the cache

If you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first
