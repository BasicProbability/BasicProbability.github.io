Subject Atari 1040  Sell or Trade for PC


        I am considering selling an Atari 1040 and purchasing an IBM compa
tible  I need to know what kind of money or trade I can expect to get for
the Atari before I bother  I am about to start graduate school and that
means Im about to be poor  Theres a price list for used synthesizers on
recmusicmakerssynth but no equivalent list for computers

This system is tailormade for a MIDI musician  Details follow

   Atari 1040 ST
      TOS 10
      1 MB RAM
      720K floppy drive

   SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive 18 months old

   12 Atari monochrome monitor

   Generic 2400 baud external modem

   Software All software is registered and comes with manuals
      Passports Master Tracks Pro Version 25 sequencing software
      Dr Ts Copyist Professional scoring software
      First Word word processor  not the PD version
      Megamaxs Laser C Version 20 programming language
      VIP Professional spreadsheet package  lowtech Lotus clone

      Migraphs Easy Draw an early prePostscript release
      NeoDesk improved desktop for Atari ST
      Universal III improved file selector for Atari ST
      Miscellaneous software including Uniterm communications software


        I will consider all prices above 900  I am also willing to
trade the Atari system for a quality 386 or 486 PC including laptops
I own some PC hardware so a complete system may not be necessary
