Subject Questions on installing PAS16 in GW2K DX266V

I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday and installed it into my Gateway
DX266V I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5
the default and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10 My question is how
should I configure for MPU401 compatibility The manual and installation
program recommended IRQ2 but on my machine it is configured to cascade to
IRQ815 So can I still use IRQ2 or should I choose a different one Right now
I have the MPU401 emulation mode turned off Actually what is this cascade to
IRQ815 business  

A related questions to other GW or VLbus machine owners I was told that 
only DMA 5 6 7 are 16 bit DMAs and 04 are 8 bit DMAs Now what about
32bit VLbus mastering DMAs Which DMA channels is used by the VLbus
extension to do 32bit DMA

Yet another question after installing PAS16 my Links golf game will hang
the machine when I select SB mode and run but works with Adlib mode
Civilization however works fine  at least so far Any body knows what I might
have done wrong 

Thanks I am obviously a newbie  John
