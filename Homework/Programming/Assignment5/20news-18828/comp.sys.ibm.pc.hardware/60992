  1 Buy a SCSI contoler  Which one I know Adaptec is good but they are  
  kind of expensive  Are there any good boards in the 100 region I want  
  it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible  Also I have seen on  
  the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives Is this true Does the  
  adapter need to be the same as the drive What type of drive is the  
  quantum
 
 
 I have tried others but I think that the Adaptec is best value for money

I have an Adaptec 1542B and am very happy with it

 
 
  2 connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable
  Do i have to worry about the power supply I think I have 200 watts and  
  all Im powering are two floppies and the seagate drive
 
 
 I dont think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of the
 SCSIIDE cards that is available  You will have to turn your IDE off

Not so I have both IDE and an Adaptec1542B in the same box and can use both
disks at the same time eg IDE to SCSI disk copy

 
  Well that seems to be all Is there anythiing Im forgetting 
  Any help is really appreciated Im lost
