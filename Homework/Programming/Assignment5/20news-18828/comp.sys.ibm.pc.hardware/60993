  I dont think you can mix the two types of drive unless you have one of  
 the
  SCSIIDE cards that is available  You will have to turn your IDE off
  
 
 Is this true I was under the impression that people on the net had both  
 SCSI and IDE working together

NO Im running both at home Ok to the cumpter is turned off right now but I
did boot BSD386 from an IDE drive most of the system is on a SCSI drive

Im using an Adaptec 1542B and a noname elcheapo IDE card

 
 
  
   Well that seems to be all Is there anythiing Im forgetting 
   Any help is really appreciated Im lost
