Subject SCSIDOSadding a 3rd drive


Does anyone know if there are any problems or if its possible
adding a third hard drivescsi to a dos pc

I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed  They work great I havent had
any problems

Well now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
larger  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chain50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to formatinitialize the disk

That didnt happen  When the pc boots the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the boardtarget
0target1target2  All three disks are seen

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk I choose to
select another  diskoption  5dos6 and voila its not there
The first two disks show up no problem but the  third  disk  is
nowhere to be found



ARGH

Ideas anyone

Thanks in advance
