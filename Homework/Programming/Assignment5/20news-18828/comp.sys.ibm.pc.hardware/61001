Since the Mac uses ONLY SCSI1 for hard drives YES the figure includes a
hundred  for SCSI drivers  This is sloppy people and DUMB
What group is this  This is not a MAC group
 Nice of you to DELETE BOTH YOUR responce and the item that prompted it
 to whit
I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home  I paid 369 for it  I
                                       

Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs IDE question

Wow you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs SCSI thing and I think
its great

Like lots of people Id really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive Seagate 1239A and
what I would say is a standard not special no cache I believe IDE controller
card on my ISA 48650

Im currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range
And Im thinking hard you should hear those gears agrinding in my head
about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit  I believe Im getting
something like 890Kbsec transfer right now according to NU  How would this
number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for my ISA PC and
the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the wailingest system I could hope for
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HDs if I
were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD
And how much would it cost

I actually have a PAS16 and could what a waste I guess it would be hook
up a SCSI HD through its SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kbsec
Actually I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS16 SCSI port  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI2 port  How could I tell  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI2  Are all SCSI
HDs SCSI2

Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions
