  NEC 5FG or now also available the NEC 5FGe  only difference
 no ACCUCOLOR   Any experiences or opinions from people who have  
used
 the NEC 5FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right  
after
 my exams are all done ie about a week from now
 
 	I have a 5FG and think it is great I havent seen the  
Nanaos so I
 cant compare but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color  
contrast is
 extremely good Ive used other Trinitron monitors eg a Sun  
SS2 color
 monitors which is a 19 Trinitron and think the 5FG is at least  
as good
 perhaps brighter and has none of these silly horizontal lines  
running across
 	BTW I could be wrong but I thought that the 5FGe is slower  
as well
 as missing ACCUCOLOR It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the  
way the 5FG
 can
 

I believe PC mag said 5FGE cant do 1280x1024
