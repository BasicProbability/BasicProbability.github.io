With your datetime problems you MIGHT have a problem with the Dallas
Clock Chip Im making a possibly bad assumption that your system has
a clock chip and that its the standard Dallas Clock Chip  I always
look at the battery and the clock chip when such things go wrong
at least as the first course of action
