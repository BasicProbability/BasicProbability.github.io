Looking for help in just the right place

Does anyone have experience with the Promise Technology Caching
IDE Controller DC99M  I just ordered one 110 with 512k installed
and have a few questions

1  Is it easy to use  Does it need any kind of TSRs or is
it completely transparent to the system board so that I wont
have to change the bios configuration

Yes its easy to use Its just like an ordinary controller
You dont have to change the bios config

2  Is it transparent to the IDE drive  Will it work with any drive
or does it have to be configured explicity for the type of drive
installed

Its transparent It works with any drive If you change the
drive you only need to change the bios config as usual

3  Will it work with a dualdrive system master and slave
Yes no problem


4  With it will I need smartdrive or DOS buffers
That depends You will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition Thats
because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower
than access to system RAM I dont use smartdrive myself
but I have a few buffers


5  Is the Promise Technology controller a good one

Any information would be greatly appreciated  Thanks
