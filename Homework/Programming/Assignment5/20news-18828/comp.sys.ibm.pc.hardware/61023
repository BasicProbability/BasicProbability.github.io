 Just got a 66MHz 486DX2 system and am considering getting a fan for the
 CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a

My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip

It attaches with peel off adhesive  This is a full size AT case so
the fan has gravity in its favor  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable
There are other board type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them  They are powered by the slot  I  dont
know how effective they are maybe someone else could comment

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCPC unit

PCConnection at 8002438088 has them for 2995  500 next day
delivery  The Y cord is 700 if you dont have a spare lead off the
power supply  PCPC make the best power supplies available IMHO
