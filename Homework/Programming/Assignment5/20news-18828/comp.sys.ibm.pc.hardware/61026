Subject Motherboard manufacturer  What is this slot for

Hi

I bought on the net here a minitower 386dx25 system  It works fine but
I have no docs on the motherboard

Does anyone know who a manufacturer named WPI is  That is the only marking
on the board that is not related to a chipconnector name  It says
c1991 WPI

Also this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard it looks
like this


  
    Batt                           
                          387        Socket for 387 math coprocessor
                                   
                       386           386 chip is about here
                                   
                    J    signs are the ISA slots
                    M 
                        P   Jumpers for turbokb etc are where
              E   marked
              R 
              S    signs are 8 banks of SIMM sockets
                      
                 These connectors are the mystery
       connectors
                        
                       What is this connector

Is this a place to plug an extra memory board in  Ive seen thatr mentioned
in some motherboard docs  Some allow an 8meg card and 8 meg in simms  Is
this what it is for

Phil
