Subject COM4 card shows up as COM3 with COM4s address and IRQ

I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3 but
when I insert that card into my DOS 502 PC it shows up
as COM3 with IRQ3 and COM4s address 2E8

When I get into debug and dump the data at 400 it shows
the address 2E8 as belonging to COM3  even though the modem
should be at COM4

Now I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested
it in a different PC  and it shows up correctly as COM4 2E8 IRQ3

To make it work in the DOS 502 PC I have to configure the
modem as COM3 2E8 IRQ3but though I have a comm program that
allows that the FAX program that came with the modem does not work
Anyway I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set
as COM4
I did run a few diagnostic programs and they did not help at all
a few displayed the modem as COM4 and others displayed it as
being COM3

I am not using Windows this is just a DOS problemAny help
or pointers appreciated
For various reasons I must have this modem work at COM4 thus
switching COM ports is not an answer

Last time I posted this I did not get any DOS specific answer
this time I have included all the specific informationplease help
