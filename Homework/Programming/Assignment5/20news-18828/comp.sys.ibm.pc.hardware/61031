Subject new 1 gig SCSI2 35 5400 rpm drives  Ratings

Ive noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI2 35 drives in
particular the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112 There is also the
Maxtor LXT1240s 6100 rpm 12 gig drive They are all quite cheap
and have nice 35 year warranties 

My questions are Is there a catch
                  Which one is better
                  What type of SCSI2 do these drives use
                  Is the service generally better for one of these     
         
                  manufacturers
                  Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason

thanks

Michael Taylor
