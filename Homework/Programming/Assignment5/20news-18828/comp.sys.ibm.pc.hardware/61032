Well Ive installed DOS 60 in three different systems with and without 
stacker A friend installed it in two other systems both with stacker

Not a single problem except perhaps some minor bugs with configsys
menus

Hes right ya know  Ive helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now
mine included  On one he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter
and it worked fine rather he sent in the coupon for the converter

In other cases Ive run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive compressing free space or whatever else
Seems to work for me

Ofcourse we did NOT repeat NOT run any program called install 
or setup or a very sophisticated AI autoconfiguring setup 
installation program that will think for you and do what you never wanted to
do but couldnt stop it from doing

Well I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever thats
worth

Also DBLSPACE is crap It writes about 40 slower than stacker reads about
20 slower and compresses about 10 LESS All tests were made on the same
computer with the same disk no cache and the same big files were used

Couldnt agree more  On my 48650 I dont miss the speed  Its still
faster than a normal disk read would be  As for the less compression
Ive sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspacebin
load before anything else  With Stacker any changes to your configsys
or autoexecbat meant rebooting twice so it could update those

Personally Im waiting for Stacker 40 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff  Plus the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PCTOOLS for sheer bells and whistles  Plus
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive

But DOS 6 is quite good reformat disks I honestly dont understand WHY
you had to do this
