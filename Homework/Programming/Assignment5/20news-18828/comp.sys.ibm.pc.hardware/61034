Subject SCSI or IDE The Bottom Line

Which would YOU choose and why

Like lots of people Id really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive Seagate 1239A and
a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 48650

Im currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range
And Im thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit
I believe Im getting something like 890Kbsec transfer right now according
to NU

How would this number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for
my ISA PC and the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the best system I could
hope for

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HDs if I
were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD
And how much would it cost

Thanks for any comments
