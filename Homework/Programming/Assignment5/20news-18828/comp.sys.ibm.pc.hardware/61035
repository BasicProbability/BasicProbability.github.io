Subject Floptical drives anyone

Just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on Remember
those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 35 floppies These drives
are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 14421 Mb
disks Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market Are the
prices really that unaffordable compared to CDROMs which are currently
not rewritable I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to
develop the first MDs for the computer My question is why isnt there
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals

Just a thought
