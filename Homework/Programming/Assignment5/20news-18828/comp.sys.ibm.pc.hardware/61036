I have a Panasonic kx1124 just inherited with no documentation which is 
giving me a problem that i cant resolve

is this the KXP1124 youre talking about  or is there a KX1124 too
Ill assume you just forgot the P

The paper out light refuses to go out 

this light is also the power light  on not blinking just means that
the power is turned on  if you look at the panel it should read

      POWER
      
      PAPER OUT

right

It starts to blink when ever i turn the power on which 2 beeps

dont know why it would do this unless youre out of paper that is

It does allow be to go on line with green
light lit simultanously the red paper out light also remains lit but is
does not blink

when you power up the printer assuming it does have paper the red power
light which when flashing doubles as paper out should light and a few
seconds later the green ONLINE light should come on

hope this helps
