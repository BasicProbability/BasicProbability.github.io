Subject EZ SCAN II Model 35

I have recently picked up a page scanner by the name of EZSCAN II
model 35  The software for it was made for perWindows 3x windows
and will not work with the newwer windows  Does any one out there kow
were I could find the company that made this beast Copyrights say
1987 And the name GMS a division of DEST  Does anyone know if these
companies still exist and if they do do they have an email address

Or if anyone knows of a freewareshareware programme that is able to
access this scanner

Thanks in advance and please email  this group scrolls way too
quickly
