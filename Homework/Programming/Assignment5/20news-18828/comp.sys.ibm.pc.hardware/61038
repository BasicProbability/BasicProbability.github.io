Subject WANTED hard drive  buytrade 80 MB or more

Greetings

	I am looking to upgrade my hard drive to a much bigger
one since I find myself kinda cramped on space althuogh I have never filled
it I would like the extra comfort of 30 megs or so  If anyone would like
to selltrade a newish 80 meg or bigger hard drive for 125 straight and
75 with a trade please email me back at johng2mattksuksuedu
with an offer  I would also sell my hard drive for about 60 if you
really want it  its a 42MB western digital IDE  Other than that I am not
sure what the transfer rate is but it is pretty fast faster than my
roommates teac drive  I have addstor running on it now and have had it
for about 5 months  I have never had a problem with it and would guarantee
it works upon deliveree  Thanks
