 I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
 486DX266 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX50 with EISA and no VLB and thus
 the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
 that Im primarily interested in the last two tasks  

 The April 13 issue of PC Magazine published benchmarks for the ATI UltraPro
 running on both VLB and EISA

 	800x60016	800x600256	1024x76816	1024x768256
 
 EISA	1534		1534		1519		1515
 VLB	1602		1631		1633		1624

This a wightened speed avarage for many windows tasks The original
poster Ross Mitchell was primary intersted in manipulating large
images which implies moving a lot of data from memory to the card 

Does anyone have the benchmarks on this particular task
