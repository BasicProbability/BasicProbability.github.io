Subject IP numbers on Ethernet Cards

   Is it possible through either pin configuration or through software
   programming to change the IP numbers on an ethernet card

The Ethernet card doesnt use the IP number 32bits usually
 it uses the Ethernet address 48bits usually
 I have never run across an Ethernet controller that
cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it
DECNET requires this feature

However that said there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet
address  They are globally unique the first three bytes being
assigned to the manufacturer by the IEEE and the last three by the
manufacturer
