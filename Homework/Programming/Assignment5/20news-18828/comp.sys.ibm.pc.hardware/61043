 GSB a 286 upgrade would probably cost about 50 386 about 150 or so  
 GSB Coprocessors or accelerator cards would cost at least that much

Tis true  I just saw an add for 28620 motherboards for 80  I have seen
whole 28612 systems complete with case power supply keyboard floppy
and mono cardmonitor going for 250
