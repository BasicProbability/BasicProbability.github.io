Subject How is a null modem c

 A humble response to a letter by Gordon Lang written 042193  2209


 GL   I am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null
 GL modem  cable Actually I have NO idea so dont count that last
 GL statement  What Im  asking is what pins does it use or what are
 GL its specifications  I just want  to solder one myself instead of
 GL buying one  I dont even know what port is  used

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack  They have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary
pins to allow two machines to communicate  These are a lot easier than
soldering the connections yourself and usually a bit more reliable
