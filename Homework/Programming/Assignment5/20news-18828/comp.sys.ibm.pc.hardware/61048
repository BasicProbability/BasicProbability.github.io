Diamond Video cards stealth viper speedstar etc 
may have excellent specifications and the windows drivers that
come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast BUT

If youre considering buying a system with a view to using
it to run Unix Linux bsd etc or some other special software
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards
This is due to Diamonds propriety attitude to its hardware
its impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
agreements

This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
XWindows compatibility with these cards as diamond didnt want to 
divulge programming neccessities

As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on its info
