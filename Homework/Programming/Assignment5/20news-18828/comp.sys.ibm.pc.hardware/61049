 If youre considering buying a system with a view to using
 it to run Unix Linux bsd etc or some other special software
 there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards
 This is due to Diamonds propriety attitude to its hardware
 its impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
 specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
 agreements

 This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
 XWindows compatibility with these cards as diamond didnt want to 
 divulge programming neccessities

Considering the above and some postings about Diamonds bad attitute
towars customers I ordered and ActixGE VLB 2M card It will arive
these days
