    I saw a posting earlier that refered to FUNETFI directory pubmsdos
however when I log on to FUNETFI I cant even find the pub directory let
alone the msdos directory   Can someone tell me what Im doing wrong

Perry Perhaps you should try nicfunetfi instead of funetfi 

Another possibility is that you did not give your email address as password
for the anonymous account If you that you see following message

This can happen if your terminal emulator does not generate the 
character as you think it is hard to see since passwords are not echoed
