Subject Re Gateway 4DX33V  too high a price

Well Gateway faxed me a price sheet just now It seems
to be on the higher side but then again maybe not

  80486DX 33 MHz
  8MB DRAM70 ns SIMMS expandable to 64MB
  250 MB Western Digital IDE 13 ms 17Mb DTR
  Local Bus IDE interface
  ATI Ultra Pro VL bus with 1MB VRAM and 24 bit drivers
  15 CrystalScan 1572FS color monitor
  All for 2445

This isnt at all too high of a price  Keep in mind that you get 8 meg of 
ram a local bus IDE and SVGA card  a 250 mb hd and a 15 
monitor  The local bus IDE and SVGA really kick butt in Windows  I have 
used a couple of machines with VLB in the past and all I can do is praise 
Gateway
