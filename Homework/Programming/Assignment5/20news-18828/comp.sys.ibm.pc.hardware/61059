Subject Phillips Monitor Conversion

Hi peeps

Heres another of those any ideas type queries

Ive been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy without
a keyboard  But no problem so far

When I dismantled it I discovered that it is really just a standard
RGB monitor with built in modemROM software etc

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked  sort of

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines
The display rolls continuously but does change modes OK only to
CGA  but useful for my laptop

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors

Ive tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC at least in the UK  DEC said
sorry Phillips dont make it any more What is it anyway
A UK support dealer said Circuit diagrams Sync

So any ideas

John
