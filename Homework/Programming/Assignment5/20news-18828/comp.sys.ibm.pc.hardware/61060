Im arguing with the phone company about a similar problem  We
installed a second phone line in our home for our kids and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line the modem returns NO DIAL TONE on its
line

When we pick up the phone and listen we can hear my kids voices
bleed through  Whenever we can hear this the modem wont dial even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker

I think its the phone companys problem but they say they cant
wont correct the problemIm still working on them
