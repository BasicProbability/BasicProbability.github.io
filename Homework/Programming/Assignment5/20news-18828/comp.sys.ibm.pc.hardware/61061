Subject Q Internal modems without uart 

Seeing all these questions about uart types their availability and their
relative merits wouldnt it be fine if for internal highspeed modems there
were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
instead accessing directly the relatively large sendreceive buffers of the  
modem thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies 
Just an idea
