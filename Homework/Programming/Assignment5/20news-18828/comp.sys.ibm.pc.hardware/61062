I am looking for information on how to install a 525 floppy as Drive
A a 325 floppy as drive B a twisted cable with the twist between
the two floppy connectors and a controller  For example should both
drives have drive select1  
Depends on the FDC but generally No  The drive at the end after the twist 
should be set as Drive 0
What about the terminating resistor pack thats in the 525 floppy  
Which connector should go into which drive
Since youre using the 525 as drive A it should be at the end after the 
twist with the resistor pack fitted
Does pin0 on the connector always correspond with pin0 on the floppy
drive
Yes
 Stuff deleted

Hope this helps  I had exactly the same problems  Unfortunately when
I changed to different machine the problems started again because
of a different FDC  Seems dont flame me this is mainly guess work
from practicle experience that some FDCs do different things with the 
select
