What tube does the Viewsonic 17 use  Does is support 1600x1280  Ive been
looking a a Philips 1762DT which uses a Sony Trinitron tube has digital
controls supports up to 1280x1024NI and has 25mm dot pitch  It can be
found for under 1000

The original poster John Navitsky said that he might use the monitor on
a SparcStation LX The LX is able to generate a picture at 12801024 at
76 Hz Not officially but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a nonsyncing screen Our tube obviously couldnt
handle this speed At 67 Hz it worked perfectly

When buying a third party monitor thats going to be used on a SparcStation
LX you might consider a monitor thats fast enough to do 12801024 at 76Hz
I dont know for sure whether the LX supports this Sun certainly wont tell
you so youll have to check
