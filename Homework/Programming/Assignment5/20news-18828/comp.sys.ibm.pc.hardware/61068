hi folks
i have a 386 25 mhz and now im buying a new 486
first question which is the best way to share hard disks
and printer
ps my two pc will be far about 10 meter and i like to use
a parallel port or ethernet card and i like to share resource
under dos linux os21 and windows 31  nt

2 which 486 i think to buy 486 dx2 50mzh local bus
  but i heard that some board coulndt work properly 
  cause some incompatibilites is that true

  should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution

  in case i buy local bus its better to buy an accelerated
  svga card with a normal local bus ide controller
  or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated
  with a normal ide controller

  3  is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color 
      svga card at which price   
  4 i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read
     musical photo kodak and computer cd rom
     i have heard about a sony and a mitsumi which is best
     and which controller work with its



     thank to everyone anserw me
