I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX266 with ISA and VLB  or   a 486DX50 with EISA and no VLB and thus
the nonlocal bus version of the ATI card  Which is better keeping in mind
that Im primarily interested in the last two tasks  

Micronics  AMI came out with EISAVLB motherboards
Byte Mag tests indicate that VLB is faster for video
but EISA is faster for disk ops So Ill wait for
GW2K to hopefully start using the Micronics board
