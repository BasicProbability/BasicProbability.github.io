Subject Help needed


For the past week or so Ive been trying to install a QIC36 tape drive
and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 EISA system with no
luck I end up getting an error miscompare during the streaming read
part of the test I am pretty certain that the port setting irq  dma are
set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands rewind
retension write and erase I also booted the system clean and still the
same proble so I also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts It has been
suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down
My system has an AMI BIOS and I dont have the advanced chip setting
option that I have seen on other systems so I cant do this Am I going to
have to accept that this set up wont work or can anyone suggest a work
around I will be glad to hear your advicesuggestions
Tony
