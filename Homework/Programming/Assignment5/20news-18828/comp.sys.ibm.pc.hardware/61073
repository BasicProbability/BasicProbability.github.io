 Does anyone know if there are any problems or if its possible
 adding a third hard drivescsi to a dos pc
 
 I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
 Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed  They work great I havent had
 any problems
 
 Well now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
 larger  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
 to the chain50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors   and   run
 the   fdisk   program   to formatinitialize the disk
 
 That didnt happen  When the pc boots the  scsi  prom   shoots
 back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the boardtarget
 0target1target2  All three disks are seen
 
 When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk I choose to
 select another  diskoption  5dos6 and voila its not there
 The first two disks show up no problem but the  third  disk  is
 nowhere to be found


I have got an Adaptec SCSI card that comes with its own version of FDISK
The problem with DOS is that it will only see two hard disks any more need to be
done by device drivers


ODD FDISK works fine for me with 2 IDE drives and a SCSI drive on
my Ultrastor 14F  only with the device driver loaded though
