 In a previous article cs3sd3aemaccsmcmasterca Holly       KS says
 
 What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external and t
 Sportster 14400 external I see that the price of a Sportster has dramatical
 dropped to below 200 but the price of the Courier remains above 400
 
 Anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a Courier
 
 The Sportster at 144 has v42 error control and v42 bis data compression
 This is becoming standard on all these high speed modems  The difference
 with the Courier is that it can run at 168 and only in the HST mode 

The courrier will not run at 16800 only the Dual Standard HST the USR
modem over 600  my courrier will do up to 14400 and with compression
error correction much more it will do v32 v32bis v42 v42bis
v22 etc etc and ASL too whatever asl is
