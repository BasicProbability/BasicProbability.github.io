discussing the use of IRQ 7

In  recent article mspraguesuperiormcwbst311b Mike Sprague writes

I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
I cant prove its true but I believe it LPT1 does not
actually use IRQ7 even though that interrupt is supposed to
be dedicated to LPT1

To put it a little differently

  IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity

  DOS doesnt monitor IRQ 7 it uses other means to determine when its
   time to send out another byte to the printer

  Most all hardware printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7 usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tristate driver and by programming just leave it
   in the highimpedence mode

  Unfortunately there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers ie either assert high or assert low for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers assert high assert low or dont
   assert anything  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper

   Incidentally note that theres no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines and
   that certainly isnt a requirement

  NonDOS operating systems OS2 NT  various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons  

And the SB16 alas is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers
