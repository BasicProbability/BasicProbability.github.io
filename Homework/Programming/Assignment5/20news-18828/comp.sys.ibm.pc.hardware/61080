Subject Re DX50 vs DX266

In article 33z5zgcrpiedu arnolm2aixrpiedu Matthew Richard Arnold writes

Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not 
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications  Plus a 50MHz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is 
buying the DX2 66  Many adds dont even mention the DX 50


One of the things going for the DX266 over the 50 is that its
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec
