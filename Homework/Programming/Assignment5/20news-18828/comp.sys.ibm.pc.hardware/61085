Subject HELP LED connectors for motherboard
Date Thu Apr 22 090248 1993


I bought a 386DX40 motherboard for 50 no documentation at all Everything
appears to work except Im having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors
working Ive looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards but the pin
configuration doesnt look anything like what is on this board Does this
pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there Any hints on where I
can find this information

                 1                 10
      speaker           
      keylock           
                 11               20
                       J23   
                             The board came with a jumper vertically across
                              these two pins

I can get the powerkeylock to work across pins 1115 reset across pins 9 and
Shown 82 press SPACE for more q to quit or h for help
                                                                                
19 but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation
The date on the board itself is 692 opti chips

I would really appreciate any help and thank you in advance

It would realy realy help if you said what chipset and if the board
was an upgradable or not board and how old it and the bios is
