Lets start with what Promise controller that you have Ther are only
about 4 or 6 of them made The one that I have the DC99m needs
nothing done but install it as stated As to the 2th hd you do know
about running FDISK on it and partisitions and then formatting it
after your finished with the fdisk operation rightSam
