 I am think of buying a new computer through the mail order I am looking at
the Gateway 2000 66V systen and the Zeoss system Which is better in terms of
value price ungrade service because I am in canada I wonder can i have
the same level of service as in the states 


I dont know about Canada but I have heard from people
doing translation work in Papua New Quinea that they
like them and have had good response on service

Another is seriously considering buying one
