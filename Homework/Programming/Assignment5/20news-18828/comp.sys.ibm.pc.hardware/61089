Subject Bios passwords

I hope that theres somebody out there that can help us

Some of our students change the AMI bios passwords on a few of our computers 
and set it for always What wed like to know is if there is a way to bypass 
or remove the password We have tried switching bios but to no avail The 
battery is soldered to the bord an all three machines is still under 
guarentee so if that would have help we cant remove the batteries

Thanks Isak
