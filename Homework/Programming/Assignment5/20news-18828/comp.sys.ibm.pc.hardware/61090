If youre considering buying a system with a view to using
it to run Unix Linux bsd etc or some other special software
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards

That is if the special software is free like Xfree86  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices  But
then they charge 

This is due to Diamonds propriety attitude to its hardware
its impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
agreements

I think they only need a signing ie no paying  This still
violates the FSFs policy of publically available code

This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
XWindows compatibility with these cards as diamond didnt want to 
divulge programming neccessities

While this is true there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards  In Linux for example there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X  Of course
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards but at least this
will allow those whore stuck with them to use LinuxX

I agree with Marks suggestion  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software avoid Diamond  But if you already
have one there may be a fix that can help you

Ask me about Linux the freely distributable Unix clone for the 386486
