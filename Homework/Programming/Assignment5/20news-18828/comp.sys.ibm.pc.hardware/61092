 What tube does the Viewsonic 17 use  Does is support 1600x1280  Ive been
 looking a a Philips 1762DT which uses a Sony Trinitron tube has digital
 controls supports up to 1280x1024NI and has 25mm dot pitch  It can be
 found for under 1000

 The original poster John Navitsky said that he might use the monitor on
 a SparcStation LX The LX is able to generate a picture at 12801024 at
 76 Hz Not officially but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
 and the LX came up with a nonsyncing screen Our tube obviously couldnt
 handle this speed At 67 Hz it worked perfectly

I dont know which tube the Viewsonic 17 uses but it has an 82khz horizontal
bandwidth so you can go pretty high  I ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as
fast as the Orchid P9000 could drive it  Also the 17 does claim to be able
to support 1600x1280 but I have no experience with that

Since I have the spec sheet in front of me Ill type some in

CRT	17 028 mm dot pitch 90 deg deflection RGB mediou short
	persisance Tint TM52 antistatic antiglare antireflection

Input Signal  RGB Analog 07Vpp 75 ohms also has setting for 1Vpp
	Sync HV Separatettl composite  sync on green 
	horizontal freq 3082Khz vertical freq 5090Hz
compatibility PC from VGA to 1600x1280 noninterlaced mac IIci and above
controls contrast brightness position size degauss pp voltage color
	temp sync select color tuning moire onoff
video band witdth 135 MHz
Max brightness 120 cdm2 at white flat field
misconvergence 35mm max at center 45mm max at corner
dimensions 163x1622x1764 weight 426 lbs

I dont know what some of those mean and dont verify their accuracy I just 
typed them in  Other things they hype on the sheet are a double quaduple
dynamic astigmatism focus  Right  They mean they use two lenses  Advanced
Invar shadow mask  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easytouse
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output  As near as I have
been able to figure out this translates to separate controls for red green
and blue  How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me

But beyond the hype the monitor is very pleasant to look at  Sharp clear
and isnt nearly as bad as the NECs for reflections
