  With Stacker any changes to your configsys
or autoexecbat meant rebooting twice so it could update those

	This is not necessary All you have to do is modify the configsys
on d   or the real boot up partitiondisk  Then you can manually
copy it to c or allow stacker to do it on boot up 

	Likewise with the autoexecbat
