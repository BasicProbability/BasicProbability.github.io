Just got a 66MHz 486DX2 system and am considering getting a fan for the
CPU The processor when running is too hot to touch so I think this is a
fairly good idea long ago when I did some electronics training I read
somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctionsgates etc
slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature hence a hot
chip goes offspec sooner

Has anyone out there got a CPU fan

yes

Is there more than 1 type

yes seen glueon tapeon clipon oneinch square and larger
my favorite is the 35 inch plastic USToyo fan I use just plopped
down on top of the chip during opencase service

Do you have to remove the CPU from its scoket to install the fan

depends on the mounting

Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines

only if the manufacturer was smart

Anyone had any trouble with CPU fans

only if it goes out  got that blanket effect which doesnt help chip life

Does anyone have any evidence that CPU fans are a complete waste of money

longer system life makes good economic sense to me

How are these fans attached glue clips melted cheese

yes  well not the melted cheese

Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to without

lets you touch the surface  the rule of thumb for cooling solidstate

  an advert Ive read claims 85F vs 185F

Any info appreciated

the attached fans look slick and work well but Im bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing

I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu  depends a lot on case and board layout though

onchip fans from Frys Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 3000 I
get the stock power supply fans for about 1100
