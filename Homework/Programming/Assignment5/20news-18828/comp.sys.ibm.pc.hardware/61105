Subject ADLIB WAV driver

I currently have a ADlib card it can play mid files in windows
but it cannot play the startup wav files 
i called microsoft no help
i cannot call adlib since they went belly up

does anyone know if there are special drivers that i need for this
if so where are they

Thanx in adlibvance
