Come to think of it though I hear and see a lot of complaints about
the ATI boards too though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
much better


	Build 59 still has a number of problemssheared fonts for 
	instance if you have Crystal Fonts enabled  Some other problems	
	color darkening and some others  I dont use the drivers in 
	any mode other than 1024x768x256 so if there are bugs in the
	other modes I cant say


Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows
OS2 where ALL the modes function properly  Anyone  Anyone


	To be honest up until now I have only found one bug in the 
	Diamond Viper drivers and it seems innocuous

	That is under Microsoft Word select Format Border click
	shading and take a look at the patterns  The 5 pattern
	has been swapped with the 90 and so on  The whole list
	is completely reversedlooks right onscreen but take
	it to another machine ie a GUP or ss24x machine or
	print it and iy showsbadly  

	Keep in mind that I use mainly 1024x768x65k mode so I cant
	speak for the others but otherwise these drivers seem pretty 
	solid

 
	Whats big noisy and has an IQ of 8
