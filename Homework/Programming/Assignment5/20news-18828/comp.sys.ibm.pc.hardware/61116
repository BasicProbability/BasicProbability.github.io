Hi
	I am buying a Quantum LPS240AT 245 MB hardisk and is deciding a
	HDDFDD controller Is 32bit VLbus HDDFDD controller faster 
	than 16 bit IDE HDDFDD controller card I hear that
	the VL bus controller is SLOWER than a IDE controller
	Which one is true

The VLIDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use I am using a NoName VLIDE IO Contr
it is tested under coretest with 2000 kbs using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kbs using a WDCaviar 2340 you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess fastest setting gets 4600 kbs under Coretest
but does not work reliable You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed I haven´t used a VLIDECache controller yet but it might speed up twice
