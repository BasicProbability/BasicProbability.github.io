Subject Joystick again


My disk that had my joystick code that some of you were kind enough to mail
me pukedspecifically I am looking for C code to read the position
of joystick WITHOUT using int15h ie accessing port 0x2000x201 directly

I need it in C becaues of memory model considerations

I only need to be able to read the X and Y position also
