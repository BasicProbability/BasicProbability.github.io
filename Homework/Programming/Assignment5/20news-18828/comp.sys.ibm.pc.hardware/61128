Subject HELP BIOS upgrade on Compaq 286 Deskpro


Howdy

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 28612
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS in order to support an IDE hard drive
and a highdensity 35 floppy

I assumed that this would be a plugandplay procedure but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it

Everything is hunkydory except the 35 floppy which will read but NOT
WRITE diskettes  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs

I have tried everything I can think of

Any takers
