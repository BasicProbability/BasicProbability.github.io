 Sorry I got a bit technical  To answer your question your Mac SE will
 have no problem whatsoever communicating with any modem that is 57600
 bps or less and since modems THAT fast dont exist yet in a
 standardized form theres no need to worry
  
actually a 144 kbps modem using standard compression v32 v42bis
cna reach 57600 bps however I have not seen any server modems that
have hardware compression  I have been told the annex modems here break
up at 36k but I have never seen faster than 144kbps

                                                                A
