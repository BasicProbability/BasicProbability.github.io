Title says it all  Id be particularly interested in the performance
difference  Just how much faster 50 is the Centris 610 over the LCIII

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State I got a chance to run
Speedometer31 on some of the new Macs  Both machines were running
System71 had a 14 RGB  Dont know what the caches were set to
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		1301			692
Graf		1567			769
Disk		222			244
Math		2557			1019

PR Rating	1291			658

So there is a comparison  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer31
