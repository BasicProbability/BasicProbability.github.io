 The program PowerStrip20 which is freeware has an option called
 Quick Discharge  You can find it on the Mac archives probably
 sumexaimstanfordedu or macarchiveumichedu


   Is it a hidden option  Im using PowerStrip 20 by Mr Caputo right now
   and cant find any quick discharge option  It definitely is on
   macarchiveumichedu cause I submitted it 

 My apologies  I goofed  The quick discharge option is part of the
Connectix PowerBook Utilities package CPU  I installed it the same
day as PowerStrip and didnt pay enough attention    Anyway the
option does exist for those of you who buy CPU
