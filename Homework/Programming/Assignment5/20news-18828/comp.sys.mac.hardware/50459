         I had asked everyone about problems installing a 4 meg
 simm and an 8 meg simm in my Centris 610 but the folks at the
 local Apple store called the folks in Cupertino and found that
 you cant have simms of different speeds in one machine even
 if they are both fast enough  ie  My 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4
 meg simms were incompatibable  Just thought people might
 want to know
                                         Jason



oh boy am i confused I thought the entire point of the 72 pin simms was
that you could use diffrent size simms so you could avoid having to use
sets  all horror stories not withstanding

                                                                A
