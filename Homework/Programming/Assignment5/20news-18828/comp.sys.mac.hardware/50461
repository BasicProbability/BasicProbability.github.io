Subject Centris 610 Impression

I have been playing with my Centris 610 for almost a week now  I must say
this machine is really fast  The hardware turnon feature is annoying but
I got PowerKey from Sophisicated Circuits and it works like a charm

However I still have a few complaints
 when I restart the machine every time the screen image the desktop
  pattern jerks up and down for a few times
 the Quantum 170 drive is noisy

Overall I highly recommend it  it is fast affordable and looks great
