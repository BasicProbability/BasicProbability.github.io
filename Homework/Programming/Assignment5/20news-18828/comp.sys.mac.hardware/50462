Is it wise to even think about removing the annoying fan from my
Classic I have no warranty to void

And where do I get a screwdriver to fit in those funny screws

Hans Granqvist Volvo Data Corp Gothenburg Sweden    my opinions only
To every complex problem there exists an easy solution thats not correct

The screws are Torx screws and the tool isnt to hard to find Its a
matter of finding one with a long enough shaft to do the trick 
 
No it is not a good idea to take that fan out  Why because it will
cause stuff to over heat  Internal hard drives motherboardYou name
it and this can cause damage  Ive known people to have hard drive
failures because of fans that didnt work right
