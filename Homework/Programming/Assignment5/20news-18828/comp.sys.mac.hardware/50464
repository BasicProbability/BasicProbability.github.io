Subject Re your opinion of the LaserWriter Select 310


In a previous article jcavellisuchicagoedu JohnC says

This model is one of the two lowcost laser printers that Apple just
introduced  Im thinking of getting one to use at home  Have any of you
had any experience with this printer   Does it have Level2 PostScript
If youve bought one are you happy with it

Frankly I think this model is a screwup  It does not have PostScriptlevel
2 only has 13 fonts and does not even have  fine print or photograde or
grayshare  Even the 300 model has this  I am shocked by the kind of
features you get for this printer  I myself was hoping for some decent
printer to replace the Personal Laser Writers
