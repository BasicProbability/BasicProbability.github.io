  kind of slated wouldnt you say  Who is going to throw all that to 
the 
  side and get the Mac OS for 486

Not Quite the point to be considdered here
Fact IfWhen Apple release system 7 or what ever is current at the time 
of release then you will see shortly afterwards Apple no longer producing 
HardwareLook at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens
Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper 
else where Heck we can get a Sun Workstation cheaper than a Quadra and 
infact we have a number of times it ALL comes down to 

  If Apple released this before windows 30 was released Id be behind 
them
  they missed the boat  So why is Apple continued development  Will it
  support the P5 to its fullest capabilities  Run faster than Windows  
It
  must do something significantly better than Windows and OS2 to warrent
  being released


No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware So the Next Step no pun intendedwell sort of is 
to make the money in software look at Microsoft if you think it cant 
happen after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE 
hardware platform

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers so will the 
temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much 
for Apple 50 million copies  100 is SERIOUS money
