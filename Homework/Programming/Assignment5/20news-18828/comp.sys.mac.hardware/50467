 My MacPlus is having problems which seem temperature related After using
 it for a while it freezes The when I turn off then on the screen doesnt
 show the disk icon and then goes dark I consulted Larry Pinas Book and 
 could not find these symptoms Has anybody else seen such symptoms
 Suggestions

Shure it is temperature dependent but this does not clean all your
problems
Based on some exp I must say that the connections between the power supply
and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure Ram simms can be
badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the
last
phase lower Voltage

So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms
1 Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray
2 readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply
3 use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowin‘ through the floppy
   a fixed piece of paper can prevent this
if you dont know how to do it beg a friendly technician
