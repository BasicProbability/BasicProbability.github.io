Subject Quadra 800 configurations


Ive noticed some of you mentioning owning a Quadra 800 8230 with CD300
and 1meg of VRAM  It seems that this configuration was purchased
complete that is the CD300 and VRAM were already installed in the box 
I am interested in that exact configuration and will be buying with an
educational discount but have not found the CD300 bundled with any Q800
smaller than the 8500
If you bought or know how to buy the 8230 with CD installed please let
me know what you know via email
