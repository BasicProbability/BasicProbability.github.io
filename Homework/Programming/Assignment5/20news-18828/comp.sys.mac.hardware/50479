Subject LaserWriter Pro 600 memory upgrade 48

Ive got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memory
upgrade

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte 300dpi no
greyscale configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the 4meg memory upgrade  For those
who dont know the extra 4meg will allow printing at 600dpi 
or greyscale at 300dpi

If the dealers have questions they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers andor Apple Customer Assistance 
18007762333 4089961010 corporate number

PS  personally Im annoyed at our school bookstore  They
really have an obligation to provide this information to all
of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original 
configuration they have the recordsthats why they ask for
things like a phone number  When I get my upgrade completed 
Im going to write Apple and complain
