Subject Re what do yall think of the IIvx

The IIvxLCIII performance at a Centris 610 price 
And unless
youre running FPUintensive software the 610 will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx

From the benchmarks Ive seen was that in MacUser or MacWeek the FPUless
Centris 610 is faster at floatingpoint operations the kind of calculations
that get routed to an FPU than a Mac IIfx

And a Mac IIfx 68030  40MHz  FPU is the fastest 030based Mac

Take note of course that benchmarks never tell the whole story Get your
favorite programs and run them on both machines at the store  They should
let you do that before you plunk down a hefty amount
