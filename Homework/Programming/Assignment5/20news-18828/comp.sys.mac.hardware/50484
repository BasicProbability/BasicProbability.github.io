 Another thing why a SCSI interface 

Because SCSI works well with removable media and works well with large
capacity devices The floppy interface you suggest handles the former but
it doesnt have any hooks for dealing with the latter youd have to kludge
it Plus its extremely low performance AND SCSI has gobs of room for
expansion compared with a floppy I can just see it lets stick a 525
a 35 a tape drive and a MO drive all on the floppy interface The
possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous
