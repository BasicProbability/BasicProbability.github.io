Subject Thanks Apple Free Ethernet on my C610


	Well I just got my Centris 610 yesterday  It took just over two 
weeks from placing the order  The dealer Rutgers computer store 
appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order  I ordered
the one without ethernet but they substituted one with ethernet
He wanted to know if that would be alright with me  They must
be backlogged on Centri wout ethernet so theyre just shipping them
with  

	Anyway Im very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions  
Being nosy I decided to open it up before powering it on for the first
time  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
must have come loose in shipping  No big deal but I would have been
pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldnt come up
	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine  Ive
heard apple will exchange it if you complain so I might try to get
it swapped
	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft poweronoff  This
wasnt mentioned in any of the literature I saw  Also the location
of the resetinterupt buttons is awful  Having keyboard control for
these functions was much more convenient
	Oh and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on powerup
Ive seen this mentioned by others so it must be afeature
	Anyway above all its fast  A great machine at a great price
