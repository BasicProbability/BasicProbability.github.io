 Does anyone have information on acheiving 1024 x 768 resolution on a Q800
 using interanl video Is this even possible 

Its most certainly possible

Is it possible to use this resolution on the Apple 16 monitor
If so I could probably rig a connector with the proper pins

    Nope The Apple 16 monitor does not support multiple resolutions
It is not a multisynching monitor
