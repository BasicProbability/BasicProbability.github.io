This is an aside to Brian Hughess please lets lose the cute phony names
everybody posting about adding memory to a Quadra 800

    What phony names My name is clearly visible in the headers and I
sing the post with my account name If you have a problem with that
then you will have to get over it Ive used this account name for over
10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7
generally recognize Hades as my account name I have no intention of
changing the way I post

I installed a couple of 16MB SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed
by the general complexity of the operation compared to for example the
wonderfully designed LC III It irritates me when Apple refuses to tell how
to do it in the Users Manual so you have to guess at how to disassemble
the devise in question its the same for adding memory to LaserWriter
Pros

    It isnt Apples responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with its hardware That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do I personally like the design of the Q800 and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays I like it a lot better than the 900950 design except
for those people who need Drive Arrays I do however agree with you
about the LW Pro design

The operation isnt very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were
offered but Apple leaves you working blind

    Again itss not Apples place to make it easy for noncertified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware even if they did buy
it Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac just dont
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no
longer valid

After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs
came into contact with the plastic case frame Mine actually contacted the
framework with quite a lot of pressure  enough so that the assembly of
the board back to the proper position was rather difficult and required
some force I could have filed a little excess material off the top of the
SIMM boards but chose to let it stand as is I have not had problems with
RAM yet so I will consider the problem annoying but not catastrophic

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC back before lowprofile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC but it did close and work just
fine One of the nice things about LogicBoards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure
