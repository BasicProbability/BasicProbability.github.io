  What is the difference
  I want a doublespin CDROM drive by May
  
  looking into NEC and Apple doublespins only
  what is the best
 
 Nec Toshiba and Sony Apple nearly deliver the same speed
 As apples prices are very low compared to there RAM SIMMS
 You should buy what is inexpencive But think of Driver revisions
 It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other
 manufacturer

	I thought NEC and Toshiba CDROM mechanism have an average 
access time of less than 200 ms  While the SONYAPPLE CDROM 
drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models
