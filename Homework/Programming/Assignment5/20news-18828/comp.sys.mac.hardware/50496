Subject Ext Hard Drives for my SE30


Im interested in getting an external hard drive for my SE30  Ive
got an internal 40MB thats pretty full even with compression sw  
Alot of people talk about MB whats a good ratio  Im thinking of adding
either an 80 or a 100 or 105  What brands would people suggest  Finally
places to buy from  Are more popular mailorder places better to order from
or the places that JUST sell hard drives eg ones that advertise in the back
of MacWorld and MacUser

Thanks in advance  If email replies are sent Ill compile them and post
them
