	I am looking for any information about the Sigma Designs
	double up board  All I can figure out is that it is a
	hardware compression board that works with AutoDoubler but
	I am not sure about this  Also how much would one cost

Ive had the board for over a year and it does work with Diskdoubler
but not with Autodoubler due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies
the owners of the boards compression technology Im writing this
from memory Ive lost the reference Please correct me if Im wrong

Using the board Ive had problems with file icons being lost but its
hard to say whether its the boards fault or something else however
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board
the icon usually reappears Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a boardcompressed file unless you have the board installed

Since Stac has its own product now it seems unlikely that the holes
in AutodoublerDiskdoubler related to the board will be fixed
Which is sad and makes me very reluctant to buy Stacs product since
theyre being so stinky But hey thats competition
