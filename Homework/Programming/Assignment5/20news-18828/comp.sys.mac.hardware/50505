Surprised Shouldnt be  Protective tarriffs almost always end up
hurting the US in the long run  Same with subsidies  they way
to build a strong economy isnt to wall it off from the tough outside
world but rather to compete in the global market place and dont
come crying when the world doesnt always want to play by our house
rules

Tell that to the Japanese their local market is neatly protected by
the Japanese government Its one very tough nut to crack In fact
the only current way to break into it is to do it with a Japanese
company as a partner in the venture
