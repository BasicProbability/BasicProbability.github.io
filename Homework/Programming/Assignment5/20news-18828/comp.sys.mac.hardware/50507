Subject Duo Dock problems

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo
properly

When I first got it the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected and I had to pull it the rest of the way Nowadays and Ive
had the system for 4 months the Duo doesnt come out at all  despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself Is there a simple fix for this or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display no VRAM no floppy or
SCSI etc 

BTW its not that the Duo is locked into the Dock  it just doesnt
want to slide out any more
