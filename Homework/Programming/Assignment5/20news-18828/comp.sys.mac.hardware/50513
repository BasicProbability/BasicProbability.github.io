Is it me my 650 or all 650s  It doesnt seem to broken  It isnt making
grinding noises or anything its just LOUD  Much louder that the fan in
the IIci I just sold

Anybody else have this problem  How about a solution  Is there a good
replacement fan thats a lot quieter but moves the same air  Any easy
way to insulate the sound but not the cooling air  Hah

I cant even hear the fan on my 650gee I wonder if its workingyup
just checked its exhausting air out the back just fine
