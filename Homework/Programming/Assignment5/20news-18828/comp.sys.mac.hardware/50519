Subject Axion Serial port switcher Good or bad

Hi

   Im looking into buying a serial port switcher because while my Mac has
two serial ports I have AppleTalk a modem a printer MIDI and a sound
digitizer  2  5 unfortunately

   Specifically Im looking at the Axion electronic switcher because it
seems to be fairly cheap  About 128 at MacZone

   Does anyone know anything about it  Ive heard that with most of these
things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables  Although Ive also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox

   Finally if the Axion stinks or if youre using something else that you
think is good Id be interested in hearing about other products  I would
like to spend under 140 if possible

   Please reply through mail Im not a regular reader of this newsgroup
If theres interest I can post a summary of replies

Thanks a lot
