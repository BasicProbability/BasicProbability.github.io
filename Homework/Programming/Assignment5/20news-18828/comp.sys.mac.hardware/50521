Subject Re IIsi at 33MHz success story


 Howdy folks  Back in September or October 92 I posted instructions
 on how to upgrade the IIsi to 25mhz by doin a little solderin
 People bolder than me have reported that theyve done the same
 procedure but put in a 66mhz oscillator instead of 50  Thus running
 the cpu at 33mhz instead of 25  So I tried it and Ill be darned if
 it doesnt work

Has anyone tried or does anyone know if this procedure will work on
an SE30  Mines old slow and in need of either death or power
