You should be able to pick up an ADB cable at any computer wiring store
Id give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary but a Im
in Victoria BC Canada and b I dont think an address in Calgary would
help you too muchbasically however I just phoned them up and they
charged me approx 15 cnd for a custom made ADB extension cable for my mouse

Hope this helps
