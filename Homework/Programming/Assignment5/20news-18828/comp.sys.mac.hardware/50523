  What is the difference
  I want a doublespin CDROM drive by May
  
  looking into NEC and Apple doublespins only
  what is the best
 
 Nec Toshiba and Sony Apple nearly deliver the same speed
 As apples prices are very low compared to there RAM SIMMS
 You should buy what is inexpencive But think of Driver revisions
 It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other
 manufacturer

	I thought NEC and Toshiba CDROM mechanism have an average 
access time of less than 200 ms  While the SONYAPPLE CDROM 
drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models

I have the a CDTechnology drive with the Toshiba mechanism and it is
supposedly the fast and best now  It has an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300Kbsec  It is multisession photocd compatible  It is
available from educorp for 599 the CDTechnology one and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free CDs  Im not sure if the cds are good since
Ive only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cds shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland  The
CDtechnology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive
which supposedly gives it a longer life and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust  A Toshiba brand drive is also available but I think the
CDTechnology is better since you get the same mechanism and at a slightly
lower price with two free CDs

The Apple 300330i Drive Sony Mechanism is around a 300ms access time I
think and a data transfer rate of 300Kbsec  I know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here  It is not widely available except through the apple
catalog which is bad at a price of only 599  It is also multisession photo
cd compatible I think the external model comes with 7 free cds some of
which are pretty good

The NEC drive has been out the longest  it has an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300Kbsec  it is available from many vendors around
600 dollars including Educorp  It wasnt multisesssion photocd compatible
before but I hear that the current version that is shipping is  Owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade  It does not come with any free cds
unless you buy it in a bundle

Of the three CDRom drives above i think the best choices would be the
Apple drive and the CDtechnologytoshiba drive  The apple drive for its
compatibility with apple products and the cdtechnologytoshiba for its
speed and performance 

BTW the models of the drives are

Apple AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i internal

CDTechnology  CDT3401 the Toshiba brand name model Im not sure but it
is also something like with 3401

NEC  CDR74


Im very happy with my drive  And have had no compatibility problems
whatsoever  If I am wrong about any of the above do correct me but I am
pretty sure of myself even when I think Im not

Also some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as
the president of CDTechnology which happens to be in southern california
my hometown  However I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy  Liu is
just a common chinese name especially in southern california with the
enormous chinese community  Besides one of my doctors in california has
three Steve Lius as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and
lives in the next dorm  This is to show that Liu is very common
