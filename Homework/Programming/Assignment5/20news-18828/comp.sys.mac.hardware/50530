Does anyone know how to open up the Apple ErgoMouse ADB Mouse II  Mine
lives near a cat true really and picks up her fur  From what I can tell
it looks like Apple welded it shut  


By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counterclockwise you can open
the mouse and clean it It isnt as obvious as the Desktop Bus Mouse I but
it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done
