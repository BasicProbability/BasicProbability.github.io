Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own

Heres why People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor
in it Apple cant deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much
power radiates far too much heat and is too large for a notebook How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that 040 power in a SemiPortable fashion
By plunking the 040 into the Dock youve got quadra power at your desk
On the road that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs
Okay not the BEST solution but its an answer to a nowin situation 
So does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBooks processor in
parallel to the docks processor Okay were getting REALLY hypothetical
now 

It would also be great for another reason  when not docked it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD your corporate email etc  In
a pinch you would also have two machines instead of 15

If they could couple that thought with RocketShare and let you use both the
030 on the PB and the 040 on the dock it would be a mighty powerful dock
