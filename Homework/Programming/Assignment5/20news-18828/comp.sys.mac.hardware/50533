 I need to get an Apple 40SC tape backup unit working under
 Sys 70x but do not have any driverssoftware to access the device 

Retrospect Dantz works nicely with this combination

I also use Retrospect but I noticed that Central Point Softwares
MacTools Backup also supports the Apple tape drive under 7x 
The Apple tape drive is quite slow so the advantages of Retrospect
relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than 
might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive  

Used Apple tape drives are going for 100 so it might make less
economic sense to pay an extra 140 for Retrospect when MacTools 
is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities

Retrospect is nice though and Im probably going to upgrade to 20
