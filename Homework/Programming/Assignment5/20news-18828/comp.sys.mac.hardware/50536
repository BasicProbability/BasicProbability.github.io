  What is the difference
  I want a doublespin CDROM drive by May
 
  looking into NEC and Apple doublespins only
  what is the best

 Nec Toshiba and Sony Apple nearly deliver the same speed
 As apples prices are very low compared to there RAM SIMMS
 You should buy what is inexpencive But think of Driver revisions
 It is easier to get driver kits from Apple than from every other
 manufacturer

        I thought NEC and Toshiba CDROM mechanism have an average
access time of less than 200 ms  While the SONYAPPLE CDROM
drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models

 Chung Yang

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time the NEC has a 280ms access
time right around the SonyApple Access time is of course
somewhat important but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate

All the drives are doublespeed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of 300Ksecond Any is a good choice Apples is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christians comment
about drivers

Plus Apples is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800 A very nice
feature if you need to install System software I dont know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines
