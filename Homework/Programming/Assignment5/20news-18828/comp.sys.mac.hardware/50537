Does anyone know how to open up the Apple ErgoMouse ADB Mouse II  Mine
lives near a cat true really and picks up her fur  From what I can tell
it looks like Apple welded it shut


By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counterclockwise you can open
the mouse and clean it It isnt as obvious as the Desktop Bus Mouse I but
it opens quite easily once you see what has to be done

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers I found that on the
original ADB mouse sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning

If the original poster has his answer Ill ask How do you open the
new ergonomic mouse By open I mean split the two halves to get at
the guts It isnt obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent
with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw
heads
