Subject Cache Card and Optimum Memory Settings

Heres a question that may be simple enough to answer but has stumped
myself and a few others

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set through control panel in your SIMMs

EX  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM an external video card so I dont
rob my SIMMs and the default Apple cache card I believe this is 32K 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMMs  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a secondary staging area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache

Im confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself  Yet Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30 performance boost on some
operations  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses

Please help Im trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above
