Subject Monitors and Video cards for SE30


Hello all
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE30 and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me
	I am mostly thinking about a 14 color monitor and an 8 bit card that
can switch between 640480 and something higher like 800600  I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen with menubar which to me is a major draw
back  Has this perhaps been fixed Or can any other cards do this like the
Micron Xceed 
	Also which monitor should I buy  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony 1304 1304s or 1320 what exactly is the difference between these
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about  Doesnt the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions

Please send me email and Ill summarize

I would also greatly appreciate getting the email addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards

Thanks in advance
