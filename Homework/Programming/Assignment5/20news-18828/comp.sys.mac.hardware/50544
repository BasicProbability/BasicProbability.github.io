	Im interested in getting a 14 color monitor for my new LCIII
Unfortunately Im really quite confused with the Sony monitors
Could someone please compare the Sony 1320 1304 and the Apple 14 
					Thanks Dan

Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD
1304 because of several manufacturing flaws  The new model is now the
1430 which just like Apples new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches
Im not sure of the details on the defects but I work at our schools
bookstore
and can tell you that nearly half of them were returned with some kind of 
defect or another

Just my two cents worth
