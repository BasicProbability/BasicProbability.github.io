  Ive got a Racet 525 MO Drive with a Ricoh RO5030E mechanism with the
new ROMs The thing is I have a new TOSOH Optical Disk 512bytes per
sector cart for the thing that refuses to mount or be formatted all the
carts that I have for the drive that work are Racet Certified Media
512ksector carts All I can think of is that this TOSOH cart uses some
kind of incompatible low level format anyone know what software will
allow this to be formatted on this drive or a new DIP setting for the
mechanism Ive tried just about every combination of drivers and custom
formatting programs I can find with no luck any ideas

joshccsabuedu  if you have a good idea please email it to this
address if possible I cant check this newsgroup constantly thanks
