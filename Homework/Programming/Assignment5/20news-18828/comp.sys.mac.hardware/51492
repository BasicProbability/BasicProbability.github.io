Subject Problems with AROSE

Does anyone work with the AROSE card

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the
system and lets crash the Mac then

Okay we dont use the card quite like one should because we simulate
errors in the 68000 Before every instruction some specified registers are
masked eg to simulate a stuckat1error in certain bits

Normally the crash instance of AROSE notices a crash sets a flag and
stops working By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card
crash That works fine for almost all crashes but as said sometimes the
card doesnt set the flag and disappears from the system

The documentation of AROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior
when crashing and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing
the assembler code and thats both frustrating and lengthy

So can anyone help
Please only reply via email as I dont read this group
