the last time I looked floptical disk
werent all that cheap 30 per floptical disk  140 per megabyte 60
per sysquest is 136 per megabyte

Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at 25
per floptical  120 per megabyte and I have seen them advertised
in MacWEEK at 20  100 per megabyte  For someone on a tight
budget the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is
less25 versus 60sometimes matters
