Since we are on the subject of chip power consumption

I heard from a very reliable source that the DEC Alpha chip uses
12 the power that Intels Pentium chip does and it still whips
the Pentiums butt  Makes you wonder why Intel ever made
a chip to begin with

Wouldnt you like a PowerBook Alpha running about 300 MIPS  Cool idea


	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt Sorry  wrong It would be an
extremely hot ideaat least with the current Alphas The available
Alphas run up to 200 MHz But they produce quite a bit of heat In
fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
sinks
	Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead
of a deal with DEC
