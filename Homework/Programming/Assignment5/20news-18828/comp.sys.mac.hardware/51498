Subject PS2 Appletalk card question


I have a chance to buy a used PS2 Appletalk card to create a network with
my home machines  However the guy who has the card tells me theres a
DB9 or DB15 cant remember now on the back of the card rather than
the 8pin or 4pin minidin that I expect  This sounds more like a
Thicknet ethernet card  Should there be a transciever on it like on the
Quadras  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of
these cards keeping in mind that its MicroChannel Architecture which
means take your best guess and double it
Email replies would be appreciated to here or to rrrideascom
Thanks
