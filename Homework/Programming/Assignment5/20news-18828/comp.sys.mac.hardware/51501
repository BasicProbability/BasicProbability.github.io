 This does not make sencewhy would the 4FG work but the 3FGx not
 workit is the
 same monitor without accucolor and digital controlsworks fine at
 1024x768 with
 SVGAwhats the dealanyway you can get a SVGA 14 with 28mm and
 1024x7 68
 for 279 at Damarkare you saing that it probably would work while a
 600 NEC wont
The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz so driving it
at 6024KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is speced at 57KHz so going 6024KHz is only 56 above
the minimally guaranteed figure

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768            Like most things you get what you pay  Thats the deal
