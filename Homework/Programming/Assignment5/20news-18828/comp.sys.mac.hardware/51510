	I also believe that the 950 fixed a bug in the CPU which screwed up
some floating point calculations

Lubarskys Law of Cybernetic Entomology  Theres always one more bug

Does someone have any definite information on this  This is the
first Ive heard of it  How does the CPU get fixed by a hardware
upgrade  This doesnt make much sense to me

Lets see now The differences between the 950 and 900 are
basically

	1 Runs at 33MHz not 25MHz
	2 Has 25MHz IO bus not 16MHz
	3 Upgraded Graphics controller
	4 3 results in Q950 requiring 80ns VRAM not 100ns
	5 ROM fixes
	    a rounding errors in floating point calculations
	       at 15th digit

So patch the ROMs with the latest OS version  I dont see
how this is a problem

	    b Ethernet problems with more than 16 buffers

So no doubt the person was refering to 5a hardly screwing
up though
