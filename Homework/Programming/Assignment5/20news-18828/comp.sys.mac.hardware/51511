Yes you get internal mixing of the analog CDAudio outputs with
the Mac generated audio on the Mac motherboard  Also you can sample
the CDAudio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
button next to the microphone icon

How do you click on the Options button  Ive never seen it undimmed

    The latest word on this is you have to disconnect the Microphone
cable on the motherboard Then the button is supposed to undim

Sorry I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
CDROM bay worked the same as the Quadra 900  Obviously they dont
I can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under
the sound cp on my Quadra 900 Microphone External and CDROM  I
always leave the microphone plugged in even though I never use
it
