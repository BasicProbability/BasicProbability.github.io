A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra 700 and opinions on
the Q700 upgrade of a IIci vs an accelerator card  So far no responsed that
Ive noticed  Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade
paths  Cost efficiency proscons etc Thanks

  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors visavis a IIci are as follows

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path dont recall this for sure but its slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure
  Ethertalk card onboard
  Audio inout
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots
  More flexible buildin video than the CI  Uses VRAM

In comparison a IIci with an accelerator wont give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options
  With a 68040 accelerator CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more
