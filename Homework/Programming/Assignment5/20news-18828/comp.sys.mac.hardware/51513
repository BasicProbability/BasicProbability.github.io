Yes you get internal mixing of the analog CDAudio outputs with
the Mac generated audio on the Mac motherboard  Also you can sample
the CDAudio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
button next to the microphone icon

 Whats this  My IIvx with an internal CD doesnt have any CDAudio
 icon

I cant find any such option on my Centris 650 either On the other hand I
dont see why I need one If I try recording sound with the builtin
microphone with an audio CD playing in the drive I get the CD audio mixed
in with the microphone sound

And I guess if I unplug the microphone then Ill get uncontaminated CD
audio admittedly sampled at 8 bits through a DAD conversion

Sorry about the misinformation  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900 see previous
post  About sampling the CD audio though have you tried it  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad  Like it needed a filter or something
Much worse than I expected  I installed the CD300 in the 
Quadra myself so maybe I missed something  Everything else
works great though
