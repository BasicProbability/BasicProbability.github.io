In article 1993Apr1411551128278kthse you write
After having used both Syqyest and Bernoullis I most enthuiastically
recommend
Bernoullis Syquests although more popular are much slower prone to
cartridge

What does your friends have Buy it

If you have no friends buy a 128 MB optical and stop

I bought a Bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
 diffrent storage solutions
OPTICAL drives are SLOW very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli

Since I needed additinol online storage rather than just a backup or archiev
e disk I choosed Bernoulli drive I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies
alot you ran out of storage real fast

IMHO the best buy currently is the Bernoulli 150Multidisk 150MB per cartridge
