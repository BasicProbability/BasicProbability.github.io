Subject Re AD conversion

 I am working a  data acquisition and analysis program to collect data
 from insect sensory organs
 Another alternative is the use of the sound input port

Can you really make due with the nonexistent dynamic range of an 8bit
converter of probably dubious linearity and monotonicity and perhaps
ACcoupled as well

It would depend on the requirements of the posters data for some
purposes 1256 resolution with or without calibration curve


Otherwise the other possibilities would be

1 get a digital voltameter with serial output  connect to serial
port on mac collect data with some communications program

2 Buy an AD chip from Analog devices BurrBrown etc connect to
a parallel to serial converter use serial port for acquisition
nah too much soldering and trouble shooting 

3 Get a board from National Instruments Data Translation Omega
etal  The finest solution but possibly the most costly



To the original poster  if the signal is too large why not
use a voltage divider Two resistors cost very cheap
