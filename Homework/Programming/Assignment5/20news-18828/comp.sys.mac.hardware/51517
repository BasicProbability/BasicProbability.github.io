A quick query for Powerbook gurus
Tom Spearman in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options
mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140180
batteries a 25 amp hour one M5545A a 28 amp hour one
M5545B and a 29 amp hour one M5545C Anyone out there
know how to determine which of these a battery is I looked at my
battery and there is no obvious exterior indication I contacted
Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he
didnt know either Anyone out there know the answer
	Thanks
