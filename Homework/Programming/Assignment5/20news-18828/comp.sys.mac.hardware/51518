 Can running a PowerBooks battery completely flat have any
 detrimental side effects other than the PB not going  I ask
 
 Only two things I can think of
 1  Although NiCad 145145160165c170180 batteries should be  
completely
     discharged about once a month LeadAcid batteries 100 shouldnt  
ever be
     completely discharged well maybe ONCE in a while is OKAY
 
 This is a very common misconception dealing with Nicad batteries  It  
is 
 a good idea to completely discharge a nicad CELL periodically  It is
 NOT a good idea to completely discharge a nicad BATTERY  The  
difference
 being that a cell is only one cell nicad puts out 12 volts like a
 rechargeable AAA AA C or D  A battery is defined as more than one
 cell 9 volt or 72 for nicad equivalent  Due to differences in the
 individual cells of a battery complete discharge can actually harm
 a nicad battery more than help it overcome the memory effect  The
 most common problem is that over time an individual cell can develop
 internal shorts which will weaken other cells that are connected to
 it thus reducing the lifespan of your battery pack
 
etc

Okay naive question How does one discharge a cell without discharging  
the entire battery
