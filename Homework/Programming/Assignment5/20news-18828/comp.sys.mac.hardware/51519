Subject Memory upgrades


Excuse me if this is a frequent question I checked in
several FAQs but couldnt really find anything

I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want
need to add additional memory  But Im on a budget
I really dont need more than 10 meg max so what is
the best performance wise and most economical way
to do this  Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory that is 4 1 meg
4 2 meg etc  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
and use the rest of what I already have  The manual
hasnt been very helpful with this

Thanks
