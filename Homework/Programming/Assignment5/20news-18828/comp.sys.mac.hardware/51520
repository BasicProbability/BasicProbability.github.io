Subject Trying to find a reliable Power Center for MACS

Hi There
	I am trying to find out a reliable Power Center it is basically
a surge protector that sits below the monitor and has individual control
for each outlet Some people have an opinion that none of them work well
The ones that I could locate in Microcenter catalogue were

Tripp Lites Isobar Command COnsole 79

Proxima Power Director 8995

Kensington Masterpiece Plus 10995

Has anyone used one of these Could you please send me your feedback
on these

thanks
