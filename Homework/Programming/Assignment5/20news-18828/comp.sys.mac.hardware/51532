Subject Re Interesting ADB behaviour on C650

In article 1993Apr1518144015490waikatoacnz I said

 I know that plugging and unplugging ADB devices with the power on is not
 supported and you can hit problems if you have multiple devices with
 clashing addresses and all that

Ive had a couple of email responses from people who seem to believe that
this sort of thing is not only unsupported it is downright dangerous

I have heard of no such warnings from anybody at Apple Just to be sure I
asked a couple of our technicians one of whom has been servicing Macs for
years There is no danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
ADB devices with the power on

SCSI yes ADB no
