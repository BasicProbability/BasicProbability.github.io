Subject LC III NuBus Capable



Forgive me if this has been asked before but here goes

My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot CompUsa and
ComputerCity Supercenter says they dont carry them

Does this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board

Much obiliged
Marvin
