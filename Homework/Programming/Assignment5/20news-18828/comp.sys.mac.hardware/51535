 I guess this changes my opinion of them and I thought I would warn
 any prospective customers for the ENSC PB

FWIW I work for FOCUS Enhancements and a lot of the people we sell our
EtherLAN SCSCT our SCSI Ethernet interface are disgruntled ENSC
users

 I also now need to know if anyone has been successful with the
 comparable product from Dayna or Focus I really dont want to use up
 that NuBus slot

Sigh  I wish I had better news  The FOCUS EtherLAN SC is currently
incompatible with the Duos  This may change in the future  We do have
Apple Register Compatible cards that are 100 compatible with the
DuoDocks though
