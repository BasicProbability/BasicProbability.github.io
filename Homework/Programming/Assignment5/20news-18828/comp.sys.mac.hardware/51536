Subject Re Interesting ADB behaviour on C650

Ive noticed an interesting phenomenon on my Centris 650 If I unplug
the 
keyboard and mouse and plug them in again without turning the power
off 
the mouse suddenly switches to about half its normal movement speed I 
check the Mouse control panel and theres no change in its setting 
thereits still on full speed the way I like it Restarting the
machine 
restores the normal mouse speed 

By the way it happens with both the newerstyle mouse that came with
the 
Centris and the olderstyle mouse from my IIfx at work Thus I dont
think 
it has anything to do with the resolution setting in the mouseits 
definitely a quirk of the ADB interface either hardware or software
in 
the Centris itself 

I have noticed this exact same phenomenon occurs with my LCIII Perhaps
it 
is a quirk of the new machines 


Sorry but mine works fine  C650

My 2 cents worth
