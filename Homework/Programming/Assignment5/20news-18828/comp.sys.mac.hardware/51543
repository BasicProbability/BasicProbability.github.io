A professor of mine once said The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about 5000 meaning the Engineer makes 5000 more than
the CS
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your
car a flight control system computer controled devices etc In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is

PS The 5000 is not just a joke
