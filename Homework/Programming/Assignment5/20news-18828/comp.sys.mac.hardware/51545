 THere is a defect in the 13 hires monitors bring it to a dealer and 
 they will replace the flyback for free I think

 them for free

The service notice on the 13 hires monitors expired 32393 after this  
date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix replacement  
of the hivoltage capacitor All you folks that have been putting up with  
intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
out on the freebie It was in force for a year If you got it free after  
323 you got a deal
