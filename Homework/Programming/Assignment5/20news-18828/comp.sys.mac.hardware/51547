 I recently purchased a Centris 610 and a Mirror Technologies 19 inch
 Mono monitor  Im wondering if it is OK to set the monitor on top
 of the CPU  The monitor weighs 54 lbs

 Ive called Apple  The person I spoke with was not sure but was
 going to find out and call me back in a couple of days  That was
 over a week ago

 If anybody knows please respond via email as I dont always have time
 to read this group  Thanks

Yea thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup I was prepared
for lots of details even shipping time  got my C610 8230CD in 5 weeks
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation  The case load spec is an example  the setup
section says Apple 14 and 16 monitors can go on top but 21 and other
big ones cant  Why couldnt they publish a maximum load

Now if I can figure out if theres any hope using the partition button
on the hard disk setup utility do I dare just try it and see what happens
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly  The getting more information section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple but didnt mention the net
