Ijust got a new Datadesk 101E keyboard to go with my new Centris 610 and have a
problem doing desktop rebuilds  I hold down the Command and Option keys and
restart but nothing happens  The DIP switches are set the right way and the
Command and Option keys seem to work on anything else  Im running 71 btw
Anyone know what the problem is
Terry


Terry hi  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E  I cant
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it however it did give me
a strange problem  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions nothing happened I tried it with another keyboard using
the same adb connector cable and it worked with the other keyboard
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works

I am annoyed with Datadesk  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspectionrepairreplacement  The technician on the phone said they
have a 1014 day turn around time meaning you should receive the
inspectedrepaired keyboard in that time  Well they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it Its annoying because it cost me 12 to send them
the keyboard they do not refund the money and their costumer service
lines are toll calls Tell me if you have a similar experience
