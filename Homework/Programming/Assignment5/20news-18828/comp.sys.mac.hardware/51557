 Im in the market for a Postscript compatible laser writer  My needs
 are pretty modest so 300 dpi 4 pages a minute would be just fine
 My budget is also pretty modest so inexpensive would also be good
 It will be working from a single mac but networkability would 
 probably be a good investment for the future

 With that in mind

 1 Anyone have comments about the suitabilityqualityvalue of a GCC
 BLP Elite printer

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it  My
needs
are much the same as what you describe  In addition I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple  The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font youre using and what paper you use  Im still experimenting with 
different papers but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine

Printing envelopes transpariencies letter head or other single feed
jobs is
very easy  There is an adjustable automatic centering guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly and doesnt feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder as some do

I have no affiliation with GCC just a satisfied customer
