 Im going to buy a DayStar 68040 with 25 MHz for the SE30 Since there
 were so many mails about problems with this board my questions
 does the board work with 71 and AUX 30  Does anybody know problems
 with any kind of software 
 
 Well I havent seen any reports of problems with the Turbo 040
 but to my knowledge Daystar has not released a version of the 
 board that works with anything but the IIsi and IIci and they
 have not finished tweakingtesting for use with AUX  This may
 not happen until the AUX 302 upgrade is released my guess so 
 Id recommend waiting or buying the 50 MHz 030 board and upgrade
 later when AUX compatibility is assured  Turbo 040 interface 
 cards for the II IIx SE30 IIcx etc will probably be available
 sooner but if AUX compatibility is a requirement it is probably
 best to be patient and let someone else be the pioneer  

An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE30 is that
just as with the 030 power cache the 040 accelerator will plug into
the CPU socket leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet
card  With DayStars upgrade path its a no lose situation
