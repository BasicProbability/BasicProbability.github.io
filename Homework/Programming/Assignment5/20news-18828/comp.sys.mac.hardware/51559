 Hm maybe Im missing something but the Centris 650 has the 040 with FPU
 At least the ones shipped here in Europe
 
 You are indeed The 480 model shipped here definitely does not have the
 FPU I own one I know


No hes not missing anything  Youre right that some models of the 650 ship in
the USA without FPU or Ethernet  Per Ejeklint is also right  all I repeat
ALL Centris 650s sold here in New Zealand and I assume Europe have the FPU
and Ethernet

I know  I bought a 650 480 and it has both FPU and Ethernet
