Subject Re A StyleWriter II question

I just read an article on the SWII One thing puzzles me the article says the
SWII is a serialonly device Does that mean Ill have to unplug my modem
each
time I want to print something

No The printer port on the Mac is also serial It has the same interface as
the ImageWriter II
