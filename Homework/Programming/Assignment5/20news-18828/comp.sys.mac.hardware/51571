Subject Powerbook 170 freezes after 18 seconds Help


A few days ago my powerbook starts to freeze after appr 18 seconds of inactivity
It stays alive as long as a program is actively running or as long as the mouse is moved

Did anyone experience similar problems
Any known fixes

Please reply by email as I cant read this newsgroup normally
