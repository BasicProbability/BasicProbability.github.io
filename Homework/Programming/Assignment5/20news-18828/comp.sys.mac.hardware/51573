Mind you this doesnt mean you shouldnt do it  The parts that can
blow the ADB power fuse and RF filter arent too expensive so IF you
have a someone around who can do componentlevel repair it may be worth
the risk especially if youre around Seattle cause you might get to
pay me to fix it   On the other hand if your only repair option
is the Applestandard logic board swap major  you should probably
play it safe


SCSI yes ADB yes Floppies yes  They can all cause trouble

OTOH some of us get lucky Ive unplugged and replugged SCSI and ADB
quite often and never blown anything  I blew out the ADB by shorting
the cable though
