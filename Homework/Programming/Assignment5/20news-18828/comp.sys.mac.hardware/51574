Subject Seeking FAX For Network Access

I am seeking recommendationsVendors for a Networkable FAX It would
mainly be used for outgoing FAXs from Macs on our Net The ability
to Fax from other platforms would be a plus Ethernet interface would
be preffered but LocalTalk would suffice Can anyone provide any info
Thanks in advance Peter
