Subject HELP  My Macintosh luggable has lines on its screen

Okay I dont use it very much but I would like for it to keep working
correctly at least as long as Apple continues to make System software
that will run on it if slowly 

Here is the problem  When the screen is tilted too far back vertical
lines appear on the screen  They are every 10 pixels or so and seem
to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus
It looks to a semitechnical person like there is a loose connection
between the screen and the rest of the computer

I am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer
or taking this one to the shop  I would also like to not have
to buy one of Larry Pinas books  I like Larry but Im not sure
I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual
for it

On a related note  what does the monitor connector connect to

Erik
