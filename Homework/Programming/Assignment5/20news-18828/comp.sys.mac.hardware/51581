Not necessarily a thridparty adapter Apple does manufacture transceivers
for thinWire and 10BaseT twisted pair cable media as well as an AUI
Attachment Unit Interface transciever They run at 100 each If you use
thinWire or 10BaseT youll probably also need terminators Apples
transceivers are selfterminated if I remember correctly but I have no
idea about DECs 

The thirdparty media adapters are usually cheaper at least in Toronto than
Apples I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple

    The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only
cant say for certain about the Models 125 and 133 so your best bet

Thats not true Only the DECstation 5000200 comes with a Thinwire
BNC coaxial Ethernet connector The 500025 5000133 and 5000240
all have a single 15pin AUI Ethernet connector only I distinctly
remembered this because when got the 5000200 first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs DECs oversized version of an AUItoBNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable for the rest of the stations

My advise to the very original poster Beverly is

1 If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and wont add
    machines to it EVER go for Thinwire regardless of the media type Going
    for UTP unshielded twisted pair wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports
    As for Thicknet its a nightmare and cabling is expensive Avoid it
    unless you have no choice eg the two machines are two floors parts

2 On the Mac side you will need
     one Thinwire media adapter from Apple or thirdparty
     MacX make sure you get version 12 117 wont run on System 71
     MacTCP which comes with MacX if you get MacX v12 you should be
      getting MacTCP v111 with it Dont use earlier versions on a Centris
     you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      selfterminated or not
     configure MacTCP to use Ethernet

3 On the DECstation side you will need
     for a Model 200 you will only need a Tconnector
     for Models 25 125 133 240 you will need an AUItoBNC adapter
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      a 15pin AUI male to a 15pin AUI female cable
     get a 25ohm terminator

Your twomachine network will look like this
