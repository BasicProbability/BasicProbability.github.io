Subject Replacing internal FDHD w floptical

Hi all  

I have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad and might just be out
of alignment I havent checked yet   If the drive is not easily
reparable Id like to replace it with an internal floptical  Can this
be easily done  Can it be done at all  

Im assuming that floptical drives can read and write both 800k and 14k
floppies  If this is not in fact true please tell me

Thanks in advance
         Kiran
