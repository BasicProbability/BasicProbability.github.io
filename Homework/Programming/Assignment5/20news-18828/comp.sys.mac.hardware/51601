With a little luck I could own a C650 sometime in the near future and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me

1  What speed SIMMS does the C650 needwant  I know that it needs 80ns
VRAMnot sure for the main RAM


60ns 72 pin simms

2  Ive heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C650s RAM132 and 136 megs  Which is true  Perhaps another phrasing
would be better  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
board or 4 megs  a 4 meg SIMM

2 configs 4mb  8mb In each case the memory is soldered on the board
leaving the 4 simm sockets open 132mb is the total addressable memory for a
650

Just wondering
