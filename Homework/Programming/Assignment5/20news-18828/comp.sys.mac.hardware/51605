Subject Re Desktop rebuild and Datadesk keyboard


My Datadesk Mac 101E keyboard has similar problems I have found that
holding down the RIGHTHAND shift key at startup will work disable
extensions but the lefthand shift key wont which is unfortunate since
the left one is the one I instinctively reach for

Similarly I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHTHAND pair of
commandoption for desktop rebuilds

I is irritating

Cheers
Michael
