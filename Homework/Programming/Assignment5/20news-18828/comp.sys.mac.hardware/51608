Subject Re ThunderScan  got a spare ImageWriter cover

Anyone have the replacement cover needed to use ThunderScan
with an ImageWriter I Or can I fool the printer into
working without its own cover by sticking a suitable
magnet into its coversensor

Thanks for any help
Ralph


The magnet trick will work Be careful when you apply the white tape to the
rubber carriage roller it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come
off
