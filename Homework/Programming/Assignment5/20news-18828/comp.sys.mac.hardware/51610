 why take that chance  If you want more detailed info on the problem

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on 
its side  I received a response from someone at Seagate Sorry I 
trashed the message stating that most newer drives Seagates at the 
least can very well compensate for gravity  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces shaking bouncing etc so dont place the drive on 
its side on a rocking chair   What constitutes a newer drive I 
dont know try calling your drive manufacturer  I have a Quantum LP240S 
internal and since I got it a month ago I am guessing its newer
