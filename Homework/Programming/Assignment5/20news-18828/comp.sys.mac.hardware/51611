I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 10 
and it works on System7  Course I only use the SWA Dutch
and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it due to the 4x size
requirement to print to the HP ie must have 40pnt definition
to print a 10pnt font  When I upgraded  I talked to Orange
Micro and they state that ver 12 of Grappler LS definitely
works with System7  However the upgrade was US40 so I
passed

Hope this helps
