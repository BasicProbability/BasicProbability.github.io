 ATTENTION Mac Quadra owners Many storage industry experts have
 concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from the standard SCSI specification This results in silent corruption
 of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices
 Although I will not name the devices since it is not their fault an
 example would be a Sony 35 inch MO without the special Maccompatible
 firmware installed One solution sometimes is to disable blind writes

This doesnt sound right to me  Dont Quadras use the 53C96  If so the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing  Thats all handled by the
chip  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the 96  That however should only really hurt
synchronous transfer which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager

Furthermore disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra
On Macs that used the 5380 which is a much lower level SCSI chip the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred  Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake  On the 5396 the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip

The docs say that its a SCSI Manager bug if this changes things at all
