I dont know about the specific problem mentioned in your
message but I definitely had SCSI problems between my
Q700 and my venerable Jasmine Megadrive 10 cartridge
drives  My solution was to get Silverlining  None of
the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives
in fact the only loop that worked was the Macintosh
Software loop whatever that means

I doubt this is a Quadraspecific problem  I had to get
rid of my venerable Bernoulli 20 last year with enough 
cartridges purchased at 90 each to make the whole thing 
worth more than my whole computer   The tech support guys
at Ocean Microsystems suggested that some thirdparty drivers 
might fix the problem  in my case the cartridges wouldnt 
formatmountpartition for AUX
