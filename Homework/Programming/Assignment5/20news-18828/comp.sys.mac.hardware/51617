About hard drive companies the original 160 meg drive that was bad bad
sector or something was an IBM  The new one is a Quantum  Is the LCIII
supposed to be shipped with IBMs  Is there a quality difference 

Officially no From experience yours now included yes Quantums seem to
be the most problemfree brand on the Mac

Second about hard drive position  Ive put the LCIII on its side and
the new 160 HD has had no problems at all  Ive even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems  As far
as Im concerned I dont believe HD position is important for drives up
to 160 meg in any computer  Dont know about CDROM though

It should not matter for the hard drive or the Mac  Well as long as it
doesnt fall over
