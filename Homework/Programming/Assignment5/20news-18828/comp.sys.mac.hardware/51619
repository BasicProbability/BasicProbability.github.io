My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot CompUsa and
ComputerCity Supercenter says they dont carry them

Does this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board

    Yes That is exactly what it means The LC family of Macs can only
use PDS cards They are not able to use NuBus
