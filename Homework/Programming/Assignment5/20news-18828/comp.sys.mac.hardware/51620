Similarly I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHTHAND pair of
commandoption for desktop rebuilds

I tried the right set and it didnt work  Im on the phone to their
tech support right now and the guys doesnt know what a desktop
rebuild is  Hes got me holding for someone else
And holding and holding and holding

Ok they finally got back to me and said basically it should work
Well it doenst and they dont know why  Guess it will go back to
MacConnection and Ill buy something else  Ive got better things
to do than play musical keyboards
