 Hi I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor
 I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip
 Is this true I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS
 slot  Is that true
 
 Thanks

Well I also have an LC III  Popping the top revealed

	One socket for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One socket for a 72pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flatpack FPU

	A processordirect slot PDS identical to the LCLC II but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side for the full 32bit
	data path that the LCLC II lacked

Thats it  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS but thats the only place
