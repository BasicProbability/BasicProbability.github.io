 Now if I can figure out if theres any hope using the partition button
 on the hard disk setup utility do I dare just try it and see what happens
 then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
 securly  The getting more information section of the manual suggested
 trying other avenues before calling Apple but didnt mention the net

The Partition button in Apples HD Setup lets you set up AUX and other
types of partitions It WONT let you create more than one normal mac
volume You need SilverLining or something similar to do that It WILL
however allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your
hard disk if you dont mind reformatting the whole thing
