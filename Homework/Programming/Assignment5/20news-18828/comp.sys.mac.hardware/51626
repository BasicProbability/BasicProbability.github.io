Subject Re Performa 450 internal modem

I hear that the Performa 450 is really an LCIII with an internal modem  Can
the modem part be obtained and installed in an LCIII  It would be nice if it
were actually a powerbook internal modem but that might be too much to hope
for

I believe you were misinformed  I checked out one of the P450s at Sears
last week  The modem is external 2400bps data with sendonly FAX
