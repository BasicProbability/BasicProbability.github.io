        I cannot speak for Dale But I am quite sure that the Macintosh 
uses the full 16bit or 32bit data path to its full advantage That is 
it is running as fast with two or four 30pin SIMMs as it would with one 
72pin SIMM Now it may be that longword accesses assuming a 32bit 
data path here get the first byte from the first SIMM the second byte 
from the second and so on This would mean that each longword of memory 
is actually split among four SIMMs one for each byte On the other hand 
it could be that the SIMMs are interleaved by word or longword not just 
by byte or they could be successive in memory and the memory 
controller deals with the eightbit data path that each one has I 
suspect though that they are interleaved to some extent so that 32 bits 
can be read or written at once This would indicate a bytelevel 
interleave
        I am NOT confusing this with the new machines longword 
interleave with two 72pin SIMMs of the same sort although that seems to 
be the same sort of idea There you get an essential 64bit data path ro 
excuse me to RAM instead of just a 32bit one Yes the CPU cant 
handle it but when writing to successive addresses it speeds something 
up
        So Dale am I right 30pin SIMMs are interleaved by bytes 
allowing the full data bus Or as is common with Usenet and me in 
particular am I as clueless as everyone else

What conclusion can be drawn from this  Im trying to figure out what kind
of memory configuration for the LC III 32bit datapath would be fastest  Any
ideas

Thanks
