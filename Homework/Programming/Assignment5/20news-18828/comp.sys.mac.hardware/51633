  ATTENTION Mac Quadra owners Many storage industry experts have
  concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
  from the standard SCSI specification This results in silent corruption
  of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices
  Although I will not name the devices since it is not their fault

Thats fine but would you name the industy experts so I can try to track
this down

 This doesnt sound right to me  Dont Quadras use the 53C96  If so the
 Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing  Thats all handled by the
 chip

Yup  Thats why Im kinda curious most SCSI problems Ive encountered
are due to cabling

noah
