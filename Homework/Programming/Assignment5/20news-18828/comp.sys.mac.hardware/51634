 My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
 such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot CompUsa and
 ComputerCity Supercenter says they dont carry them
 
 Does this mean LC III is incapable of carrying a NuBus board

Apple doesnt make such a card though I suppose a third party could  One
big problem is that there isnt room for a standard NuBus card inside the
LC III

noah
