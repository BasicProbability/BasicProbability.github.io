 Yes you get internal mixing of the analog CDAudio outputs with
 the Mac generated audio on the Mac motherboard  Also you can sample
 the CDAudio using the sound control panel by clicking on the Options
 button next to the microphone icon
 How do you click on the Options button  Ive never seen it undimmed
 
     The latest word on this is you have to disconnect the Microphone
 cable on the motherboard Then the button is supposed to undim

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed 
I dont believe the button undims since theres nothing to select  I
havent tracked down a Centris to check this on though

 Sorry I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
 CDROM bay worked the same as the Quadra 900  Obviously they dont

Yup I made the same mistake several months ago when this issue came up
before 


noah
