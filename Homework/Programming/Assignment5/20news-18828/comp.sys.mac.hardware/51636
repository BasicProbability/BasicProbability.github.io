Subject x86  680x0   How do they compare

Im sure Intel and Motorola are competing neckandneck for 
crunchpower but for a given clock speed how do we rank the
following from 1st to 6th
  486		68040
  386		68030
  286		68020

While youre at it where will the following fit into the list
  68060
  Pentium
  PowerPC

And about clock speed  Does doubling the clock speed double the
overall processor speed  And fill in the s below
  68030   MHz  68040   MHz

Thanks very much  Id appreciate hearing any further explanations
from any experienced folks out there too
