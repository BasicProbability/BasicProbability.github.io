I like it a lot It is worth the additional expense The only problem I
found is with MS Word 51a If you have a table the is longer than
a page and the cells have a visible border the last bottom of page
line on the first page will be missing It makes no difference how
the table is formatted The worst is that it doesnt show up in words
page view or page preview
