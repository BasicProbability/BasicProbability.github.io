  Doesnt a 1 MB SIMM have about 1024  1024  8 moving flipflops

 They dont move to anybody much bigger than an electron 

Dynamic RAM is not based on flipflops theres basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit  Static RAM is based on
flipflops and is much more expensive and much less dense  And
neither has any parts that move if electrons and thermal expansion
are ignored

 noah
