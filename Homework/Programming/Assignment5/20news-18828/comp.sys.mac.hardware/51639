Floptical is of course a different technology and doesnt enjoy the
long
term data storage of opticals  And the last time I looked floptical
disk
werent all that cheap 30 per floptical disk  140 per megabyte 60
per sysquest is 136 per megabyte


I dont know how many times Ive posted this the net  No one EVER
listens  

Once and for all  Floptical Media is only 140 a megabyte if you dont
know where to buy it  I am bying my flopticals at 30 per 2 disks  I
see that as 75 a meagabyte NOT 140  No Im not buying in bulk Im
not getting a special deal  75 a meg is good in my book Approching
floppy price
