 A while ago I posted a note asking for specs on the Quadra 700 and opinions on
 the Q700 upgrade of a IIci vs an accelerator card  So far no responsed that
 Ive noticed  Please let me know what you think of these possible upgrade
 paths  Cost efficiency proscons etc Thanks
 
   Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
 copy of MacWorld or MacUser  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
 comparison factors visavis a IIci are as follows
 
   25 MHz 68040
   16 Mhz data path dont recall this for sure but its slower
       than Q 950 style machines for sure
   Ethertalk card onboard
   Audio inout
   4 MB RAM on motherboard
   4 SIMM slots
   2 NuBus slots
   More flexible buildin video than the CI  Uses VRAM
 
 In comparison a IIci with an accelerator wont give you
   audio or ethernet  or the same video options
   With a 68040 accelerator CPU performance can be comparable but I
   think it ends up costing more

  Actually an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 25 MHz  The accelerator costs about 1400 whereas
the upgrade costs 2131 just quoted from my dealer  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21
with 8 bit depth and up to 16 at 24 bit depth with additional VRAM  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you youre
better off getting the Q700 upgrade otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator
