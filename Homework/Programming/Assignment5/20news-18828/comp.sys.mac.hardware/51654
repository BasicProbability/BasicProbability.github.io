Subject Monitor for LCIII


Hi folks

Im planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor
What do people recommend for a decent 1415 monitor  

Iv looked at some ads and the spec for NEC 4FG4FGe and the price is 
within my budget but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions 
available on 4FG specifically the 1024x768 resolution Does LCIII only 
support one resolution

Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or
monitors Does anyone have experience with the following mailorder places

	SYEX EXPRESS 	Houston Tx
	USA FLEX 	Bloomingdale Il

Thanks

jeff
