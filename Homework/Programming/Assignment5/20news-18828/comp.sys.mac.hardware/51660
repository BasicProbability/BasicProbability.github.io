 We are doing heavy  duty image processing with some seriously
 underpowered Macs Mac IIsi for example  Most of the CPU time is
 burned in doing FFTs
 
 What cards are out there which would allow us to take away that part
 of the load from the CPU  Any DSP 56001 or i860 cards out there
 for example  Theyd have to be callable from Think Pascal to
 replace the one  and two  dimensional FFTs routines in an already
 existing program

Check out the National Instruments NBDSP2300 This uses the Texas
Instruments TMS320C30 chip which is a true 32 bit floating point DSP Its
pricey however
