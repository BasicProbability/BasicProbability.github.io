    I would like to buy a 16 bit ADC card for the Mac II with digitization
 rate of at least 100 kHz preferably 200 kHz  I would prefer one with 
 good differential and integral linearity and DMA would be a plus  Other
 than National Instruments do you know of any other vendor who sells such
 a card
 
 Instrutech Corp has a nice looking 16 bit AD and DA board that can run
 at the speeds you want The ITC16  doesnt have DMA but it does have
 a good sized FIFO that can buffer your samples Instrutech can be reached
 at 516 8295942 or 9290934 FAX
 

I dont know about the Instrutech boards though I plan to check them out
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and SN ratio of
many of the 16 bit boards out there The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity SN ratio accuracy etc and the
NBA2100 and NBA2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that youd expect from a good true 16 bit converter This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards for example
