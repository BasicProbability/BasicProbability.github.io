Subject Power Supplies for Mac 512s


I thnik ill be able to pick up  a piar of Mac 512Ks for nothing but
their power supplies are dead  Anyone know where I can pick up a pair
of refurbished PSs for cheap preferably mail order
Yes I do have uses planned fior them  One will be sold to a friend who
just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his email account
The other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads andor
printing
  
Also what is the latest system software usable with these suckers
