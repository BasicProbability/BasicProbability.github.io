Subject Re HELP Duo 230 problems

  I just got a Duo 230 and Im having some difficulties
If the machine is plugged in to the wall adapter put to sleep
unplugged from the wall and woken up it crashes 75 of the time
Theres nothing but the original system software on the machine

The battery has plenty of life  I think this must be a power manager
problem but I dont know what to do about it

Also the speaker occasionally makes a highpitched hiss  The noise
is irregular but seems to favor sleep and restart commands

Ive had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems  thinking they were
system software problems Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen  it freezes

I also get the highpitched hiss occasionally  but only at
startup

Ive called the apple hotline 800 SOSAPPL three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duos screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep This problem only occured
twice Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I cant
afford to be without my Duo at this time

Anyone out there with these same problems
