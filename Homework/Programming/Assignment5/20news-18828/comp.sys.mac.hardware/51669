  Hi I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor
  I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip
  Is this true I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS
  slot  Is that true
  
  Thanks

 Well I also have an LC III  Popping the top revealed
 
 	One socket for an additional VRAM SIMM
 
 	One socket for a 72pin RAM SIMM
 
 	One socket for a flatpack FPU
 
 	A processordirect slot PDS identical to the LCLC II but with
 	an additional set of connetions to one side for the full 32bit
 	data path that the LCLC II lacked
 
 Thats it  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
 in the PDS but thats the only place
 
So will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade or will it 
require a logic board swap It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPUs 680x0 like RocketShare But I 
guess thats getting a bit fantastic

I was wondering since MacWeek reported that developers were seeded with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card

Also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed Last I heard the 
estimates were around 34 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q1 94 but I doubt its true

Finally is the PowerPC developers CD minicourse available I saw it 
advertised in the developers university calendar and Id like to know if its
at all interesting
