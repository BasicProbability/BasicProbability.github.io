Subject Dont repair that sticky mouse buttonCALL APPLE


 Xposted to compsysmachardware and miscconsumers 

Youve heard about Apples great new customer support program  Well
think again  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple
computer users can give to each other  For another example read on

In the March 15th issue of MacWeek Ric Ford described a twoyear effort
by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apples attention a problem with
certain defective mice  At random the switches on these mice stick in
the down position until clicked a second time apparently regardless of the
machine they are used with or the system software involved Most of the
reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of
BCGA65431 Youll recognize this sticky button symptom immediately if you
have such a mouse the problem is intermittent but its not subtle

Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem and instead 
suggested that people contact Apples Customer Assistance Center directly
MacWeek 4593 p 64 When I called Apple on March 23rd and described
my defective mouse I was eventually given a case number F83Y and told
Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of
warranty  After waiting for three weeks I called back today wondering
where my new mouse was This time I was told that Apple had decided the
serial number on my mouse MB13831FC25 is not within the undisclosed
range Apple is willing to replace and there is nothing I can do about it

Nothing that is unless enough people complain about this problem to make
it worth Apples while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice
Please if you have one of these mice I NEED YOUR HELP Dont assume you
know what causes the problem there are lots of theories and start
hacking around inside your hundreddollar mouse Instead let Apple do it
Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at

the details of your case including your mouses serial number  Be firm

Network managers and usergroup leaders especially please query your user
bases Everyone ask your friends and colleagues  Please dont send mail to
me or post yet another stickybutton report CALL APPLE DIRECTLY  If
enough victims take the trouble to report this wellknown problem Apple
will eventually be forced to respond  If Apple continues to find it easy
to stonewall on this issue dont expect them to offer support when the
next potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered
