Subject For the poor owner of IIsi

Macintosh IIsi 340 80ns
Clockupgraded IIsi works well at 25MHZ however does not work with
Nubus adaptor and 1400k disk even though it can readwrite 800k disk
at32MHz Interestingly upgraded IIsi overcomes basically the fighting
between the Vedio and the System so that CPU never be reduced below 8 no
mater whether the cache is on or off This is pretty useful when you
use the virtual memory of system 7
