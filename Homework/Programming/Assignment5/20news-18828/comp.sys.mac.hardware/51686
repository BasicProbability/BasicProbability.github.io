Hi what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have if
they want to go at least 9600 baud

Every place in town says they are back ordered and part of the reason
I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
wherever I am but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get
a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud

Youre not going to like this but if memory serves me postings
Ive read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no repeat no internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem at any speed  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture or something  Im vague on the
details but the gist was that there are going to be no
thirdparty internal Duo modems  If Im wrong somebody please
correct me on this  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news
