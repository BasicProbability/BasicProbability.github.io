Subject sony 1304  Rasterops 24sxsi for SALE  UPDATE

Hello fellow humans and other net creatures
 
If youre at all interested in this merchandise please email me
djkccwfccutexasedu
 
Im compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system so I have
two monitors and cards for sale Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces
Im just wanting to conserve desk space and get all of my info from one
screen
 
Id prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas within
driving distance  like an hour away perhaps but I CAN ship to you if you
dont live near here Only problem is that I didnt keep the original boxes
for the monitors but Im confident that my few months of fulltime service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction

Mirror Full Page Display monochrome wnubus card

 
SOLD
 
Sony 1304 14 color monitor

Whats to say It got top ratings in last years MacUser report Its a SONY
Trinitron arguably the best but Id rather not argue that point
Its a great monitor in great shape but Im going to a bigger screen
and although Id like to keep it finances dont justify it
 
Still selling for 599 at MacLand where I bought it originally  not
including shipping will sell for 475 plus shipping Again make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable
 
 
RasterOps 24si 24bit accelerated hardware zoompan 4 meg RAM

Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it this board is for 13
monitors providing accelerated 24bit hardware zoompan NTSC mode
you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM or a
RAM disk Software included for such functions 4 meg of RAM included 1 meg
SIMMS
 
Selling for 605 at Bottom Line without the RAM  add 100 Im asking
525 shipping included this time its just a card Original box and
packaging Id actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together so if you want both drop me email and make a bundled offer
for these items
 

 
Cheers
