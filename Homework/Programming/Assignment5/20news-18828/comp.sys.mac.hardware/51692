Im about to purchase a laser printer for my Mac and I read the MacUser
Buying Guide special issue All HP printers except IIISI are rated very low
compared to other noname bargainpriced printers Why is that so On the PC
HP printers are THE standard amongst printer manufacturers

PS My personnal favorite budgetwise would be the IIIP

The IIIP has just been superseded by the 4M which is the one I am using at
work  The quality of the print is execellent beating 300 dpi printers hands
down  In Australia the price of the 4M is about comparable with that of the
IIIseries so HP are trying to get people to buy the new one
