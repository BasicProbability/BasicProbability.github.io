Has anyone out there in netland any experience with accelerators
for SE I am specially interested in
   speed up rate  or compared to eg SE30
   need for new SIMMs speed in ns
   maximum RAM after upgrade
   compatibility I am mainly using FrameMaker
   can I use an additional big bw screen 15 to 21
   can I install the accellerator myself no soldering
   pricewhere to buy

I have no experience with this particular hardware but
just about every month in Macworld there is an add for
an combined SE acceleratorVideo board  This item sells
for about 1000 and comes with a 25MHz 6803068882 pair
eight SIMM slots and a grayscale 21 monitor

This accelerator plugs into the SEs lone expansion port
and thus no soldering  You will however need a long
TORX wrench to get the case open but thats not really
a big deal

Does that sound like what you were looking for
