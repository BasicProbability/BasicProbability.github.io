Subject  Whats the difference between a Mac Portable and Powerbook 100

Ive been looking into getting a portable Mac to do some work and Ive
had my eye on the PB 100 Lately Ive been seeing people with the old
portables and theyre selling for 300 LESS that the PB 100s What I
want to know is what are the differences between them All I know is
that the Portable is heavier but the PB100 doesnt have an internal
drive Heres what I NEED to know

Does the portable support Appletalknetwork connections
Whats the CPU inside a Portable 68000
DOES THE PORTABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM 7
Whats the maximum memory capacity of the Portable Can you still get
	RAM meaning does it use special SIMMS
What kind of internal HD does it use
Does the Portable have a better screen

						THANX in advance
