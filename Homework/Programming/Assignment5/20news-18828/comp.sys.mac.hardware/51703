Subject Re Put ex syquest in Centris 610

Ive just installed a 525 tape backup in my C610 lot of the issues
are the same  So to answer your questions

 My PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the
 drive to an id switch on the outside of the case  Where do I connect
 this switch  Can the computer just tell with internal drives

You probably want to hardwire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers  Put
it at a convenient number like 1  You could cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch but why go through the
hassle  You probably wont be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive

	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard I
didnt look closely but I seem to recall it laying over the ram thats
soldered onto the motherboard  Would that cause problems

Yeah when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too  But its no problem the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang  It shouldnt reach back beyond the ROMRAMVRAM
SIMMs though

	One last question  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover  
the drives front panel is smaller than the space left in the case the
drives panel is the same size as the spotsBM clones cases  Should I just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place

You can specialorder parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer  The relevant parts are

  9220358  blank bezel faceplate
  9220850  CDROM carrier ie generic 525 device mounting bracket

Note Apples unfortunate choice of name for the slidein bracket to
mount a 525 device  The service techs I talked to said Oh sure
we stock those  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive

As far as I can tell Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 525 device  Why not  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
525 bay why not provide the faceplate   They do sell a cutout for
their CDROM drive of course but thats of no use

Im going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive which is a standard 525 device

Good luck with your SyQuest

	Fred
