  Hi what alternatives to the Express modem do Duo owners have if
  they want to go at least 9600 baud

  Every place in town says they are back ordered and part of the reason
  I want a laptop mac is so I can use it as a remote terminal from
  wherever I am but I really would hate to have to wait 2 months to get
  a modem in or have to settle with 2400 baud

If Apple didnt put out such a good product  Id gladly take my
business to  to  the 8bit Ataris  I think the
situation with the Express modem is inexusable for any business
Ive had mine on order since January  Apple finally called me last
week  to tell me that I should have it by the second week of May
In the meantime Ive been stuck with my Duo210 without the
connectability I needed it for  Im sure there are plenty of people
who can bite back at me citing all sorts of reasons why Apple is
right or at least justified but Im just a crabby consumer and
when I order a Duo210 with modem thats the product I expect

Oh well  Its not like its limited to the computer biz  Remember
when the Miata came out  What about those Cabbage Patch Dolls  Well
I want my toy
