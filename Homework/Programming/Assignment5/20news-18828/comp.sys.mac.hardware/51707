Id appreciate it greatly if someone could Email me the following
if you only know one thats fine
1 Specs for the 68040 esp how it compares to the Pentium

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book  Some highlights are
32bit address space w 32bit data width  18 32bit integer registers 
 8 80bit floating point registers  8K copyback capable caches
4way set associative  Typical 12 clocksinteger instruction  5
clocks for a floating point multiply

interesting aside the 68040 can multiply two 80bit floating point
numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32bit integers

2 Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost release date etc

More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching  Figure
about 08 clocks per instruction typical my guess  But the Motorola
guys are pretty bright it may be less

Im interested in speeds systems it can run Windows NT RISC or whatever
costs bus info register info  All the technical info

Call Motorola  Im not typing it all in

I am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people

Im predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their
ends  New experimental processors have 64bit data pathways and can
schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle  That sort
of trick cant really be done with CISC architectures

I finally saw some details on the 586Pentium and was not greatly
impressed  Theyve finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to
speed but otherwise its only going to be a 2x speedup  And to get
that theyre using two integer units larger caches and a branch
target buffer  Yes I know theyre talking about 100MHz processors
Big whoop  Designing a 100MHz board is difficult and really
expensive  Priced 15ns memory chips lately
