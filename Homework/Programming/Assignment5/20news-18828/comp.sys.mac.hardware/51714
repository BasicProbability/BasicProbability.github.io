Subject Reseting LW IIg to factory defaults

I have a Laserwriter IIg that has disappeared completely from the
Network ie its name doesnt show up in any zone  You can print
to it from its serial interface tho  I have seen some discussion
here about changing the zone a IIg is in including some PS code
that lets you change the zone  Is there maybe some PS code you can
use to have it go back to all its factory default settings  I have
a feeling thats what needed to heal ours
