Subject Upgrading PB170 Memory

I  have one of the original Powerbook 170s with 4Mb of Ram and find
that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work  So what is the best way
to get the maximum RAM for this unit and whats it going to cost me
Im hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting 
to this group

Thanks in advance
Bill
