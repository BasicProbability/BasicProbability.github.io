Subject SUMMARY ZyXEL Strings


I write
I recently got a ZyXEL U1496E modem  Its great but Im still having
some problems figuring out what strings to use in what applications
I basically need strings for Zterm FirstClass client and Telefinder
client  Ive been able to get FirstClass and Zterm working by using 
another modems settings in FirstClass and copying them for Zterm
However it still has problems  Zterm for example will list ERROR
the first time I try dialing after starting the problem  If I cancel and
try again it works fine  Telefinder is even worse  I cant get it to
even wake up the modem  So if anyone uses a ZyXEL for any of these
programs Id greatly appreciate you sending me the setup strings you use
Thanks in advance

For zterm I initially did the following
atz4
atd0
atw0
Then I set my init string to atz0
Thats it

I cant help you with FirstClass or Telefinder but Ive been using ZTerm
and a
ZyXEL for close to two weeks now  Heres what I did

Once in ZTerm set hardware handshaking on and the bps rate to 57600
Youve
probably already done this  Then I typed

atd0
atw

The first line sets the modem to ignore the DTR line necessary for
hardware
handshaking with most though not all Mac hardware handshaking cables
The
second stores this setting in nonvolatile memory in the modem so its the
default when the modem starts  In the modem preferences dialog I have the
modem initialization string set to atz0M which just insures that the
stored setting is used useful if starting ZTerm after using something like
the
fax software or MacWoof which change the settings in other ways 
Alternatively you could leave the factory default the way it is and just
set
the ZTerm initialization string to atd0M which would accomplish the
same
thing IF the modem is always on before you start ZTerm and IF other
programs
dont modify the settings  Or atz0d0M would work even if other
programs
modify the modems settings  I do it the way I do because I sometimes
forget
to turn on the modem before launching ZTerm and this way Im assured of
having
the correct DTR handling when the modems powered up
 
After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide I
came up with
ATZ0L2N2X5D0S1150M
This is entered in the Initialize box on the Modem Preferences in Zterm
Quick summary of each commmand
Z0	 Reset modem to User Profile 0
L2	 Speaker volume at 2 fairly quiet
N2	 Ring volume at 2 fairly quiet
X5	 Display connect info according to setting 5 see manual
D0	 Assume DTR computer is always on
S1150	 Dial speed at 50 as fast as ZyXEL can handle

In FirstClass I used this same string with the addition of S00 right
before the S11 command in the setup box  This disables the autoanswer 
function of the modem for FirstClass  I based my modem setting on the Supra
144FAX and just changed the above mentioned string

In Telefinder I based my setting on the Zoom V42  HH setting  I changed
the Modem Initialization string to the same one I used for FirstClass and
everything seems to work fine

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out  If someone wants to forward
this to the infomacreports directory at sumexaim it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings and
also save the net some redundant messages  If anyone else has something
to add feel free
