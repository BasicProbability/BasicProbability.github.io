Subject How often are SIMMs bad mail order

Hi everyone Just the other day I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from
Mac Connection They sent it overnight very nice and I got it installed
and we found that it didnt work properly When you put the computer in 
thousands mode the bottom of the screen using the new chip is all flickering
and fuzzy So I called them up and Im going to return it for a new one

My question is how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general
Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad Is this
a rarity This is the first chip Ive ordered so I have no other experience
in this area Im just curious if anyone else has had the same type of
experience

Thats about it Please email me and if people want I can post a summary
Thanks all
