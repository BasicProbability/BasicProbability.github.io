Subject TCPIP routing LocalTalkEthernet

Here is the story
I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk One of them has an
Ethernet Card and is currently connected to a NeXT dont laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem

Currently we can telnet from the Mac w Ethernet to the NeXT
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac From what we have heard AIR doesnt do
the trick

Software solutions would be good too but my impression is that
there arent going to be any

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again The SLIP connection doesnt allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines so everyone shares that 1 numberoh well

thanks in advance
