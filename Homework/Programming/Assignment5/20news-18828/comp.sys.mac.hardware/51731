Subject Why does Apple give us a confusing message


Hi there

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C650 regarding fpu  In all Mac price lists Ive seen every C650
has the message fpu optional  I know from what weve discussed in this
newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 480
configuration  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
Im planning to buy the C650 8230cd pretty soon but Im now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
Why say optional if its built in
Please anybody help me understand this game

Regards

Thian
