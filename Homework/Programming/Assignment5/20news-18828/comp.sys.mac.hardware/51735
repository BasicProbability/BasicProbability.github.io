Subject x86  680x0   How do they compare

I believe it goes or will go
680060
powerPC
Pentium
680040
486
680030
386
680020
286680000

In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was
 slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel But this is using a system designed
 for the 030 So It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie
 quadra would do better So overall Id figure 040  030  25 or so
    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system
 at the level of a fast quadra but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the
 speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems and wait for the 680060 I think
 it laps the pentium
