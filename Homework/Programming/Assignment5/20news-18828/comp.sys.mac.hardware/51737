 I  have one of the original Powerbook 170s with 4Mb of Ram and find
 that 4Mb is a drag when trying to do my work  So what is the best way
 to get the maximum RAM for this unit and whats it going to cost me
 Im hoping I can get the latest and best info from real users by posting 
 to this group

Well Bill There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM
expansion slot giving you 4MB The only thing you can do to upgrade to
the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion
giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170You can try calling
TechWorks or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek MacWorldetc
