Subject Re Computer Engr vs Computer Science

A professor of mine once said The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about 5000 meaning the Engineer makes 5000 more than
the CS
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use ie database graphics word processors etc while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems ie the computer in your
car a flight control system computer controled devices etc In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is

PS The 5000 is not just a joke

For the most part this is a bunch of bunk  Ive got a Computer Engineering
degree yet Ive spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
use  Moreover the salary distinctions are incorrect I received 3 job offers
upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
7000year lower  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you and pick the major that allows you to take them
