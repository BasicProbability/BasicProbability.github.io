 I dont know about the Instrutech boards though I plan to check them out
 but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and SN ratio of
 many of the 16 bit boards out there The NI boards are very clearly
 specified in terms of monotonicity SN ratio accuracy etc and the
 NBA2100 and NBA2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
 distortion that youd expect from a good true 16 bit converter This is
 not true for the Spectral Innovations boards for example

To boorishly reply to myself I found I did have the Instrutech information
already The specs to use the term loosely are as follows

AD 16 bit converter with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz 12 bit accuracy to
200 kHz No specs for SN monotonicity linearity There are 8 multiplexed
inputs sharing the single AD so that all inputs are not samples at the
same time and in the above conversion specs the allchannel sample rate
must be used Thus for two channels you only have 14 unknown quality bits
at 50 kHz per channel This is poorer quality than the national
Instruments at the same sample rate

DA 16 bit converter No specs for SN monotonicity linearity Each of
the 4 output channels has its own converter

The price for the external converter box the ITC16 the NuBus interface
board the MAC23 plus C driver software and Igor XOPs is 2695 Rather
steep
