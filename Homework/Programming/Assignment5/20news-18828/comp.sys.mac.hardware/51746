I believe it goes or will go

powerPC
Pentium

Not quite 66MHz Pentium  65 SPECint92 57 SPECfp92 
	   66MHz MC98601  50 SPECint92 80 SPECfp92 

Note that SPECint is more important for most real world applications

680040
486

As far as the 486DX266 goes  32 SPECint92 16 SPECfp92 

680030

680020
286680000

In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was
 slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel But this is using a system designed
 for the 030 So It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie
 quadra would do better So overall Id figure 040  030  25 or so
    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system
 at the level of a fast quadra but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the
 speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems and wait for the 680060 I think
 it laps the pentium

Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola equivalents
although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
is something that is highly debatable
