Subject Re x86  680x0  How do they compare

Not quite 66MHz Pentium  65 SPECint92 57 SPECfp92 
	   66MHz MC98601  50 SPECint92 80 SPECfp92 

But the interesting comparision is how fast clockcycle chips
you can get  an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz but blazes at
200 MHz

680040
486

As far as the 486DX266 goes  32 SPECint92 16 SPECfp92 

But the 68040 is or will soon be available in 40 MHz version
making it comparable to a 486DX280

Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola equivalents
although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
is something that is highly debatable

I think you have that one turned around they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTEoriented longest Intel instruction
is 15 bytes what an odd number  which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem

Cheers
