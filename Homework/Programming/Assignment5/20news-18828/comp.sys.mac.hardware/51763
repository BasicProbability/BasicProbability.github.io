Subject Has anyone had problems with IBM drives in their machines


Hi

The subject line says it all  My system acts weird at times  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt boot blocks will get chewed etc

This was a really big problem for a while  I couldnt even format my
drive properly  I installed HDTs driver and things got better  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive

Im looking for a pure hardware solution  Its not a virus bad
software etc  Could I have a bad SCSI cable  Or is the IBM WDS80
just a screwey drive

Thanks

Chuck
