Subject Re Why does Apple give us a confusing message

Hi there

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C650 regarding fpu  In all Mac price lists Ive seen every C650
has the message fpu optional  I know from what weve discussed in this
newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 480
configuration  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list
Im planning to buy the C650 8230cd pretty soon but Im now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not
Why say optional if its built in
Please anybody help me understand this game

Regards

Thian

If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration you are getting a Mac with
a 68RC040 processor that has builtin math coprocessor support  My 
understanding is that the optional fpu refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris 650 480 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the nonFPU system to become an FPU
system  And it is unclear whether the 040 processor on the nonFPU system
a 68LC040 can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor
Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610 which ONLY
comes with a nonFPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU 
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another again according to Apples memo

Hope that helps
