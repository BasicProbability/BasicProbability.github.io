Subject Any Nanao 750i compatible Mac video cards

Does anyone know if a Nanao 750i is compatible with any
popular Mac video cards I have an oppurtunity to get a brand
new one cheap and I am very tempted but it will be a waste
of time if I cant drive it using a standard video card

While Im on the subject whats everybodys reccomendations for
a 21 color monitor Ive heard good things about the NEC 6FG and
of course there is always the reliable old Macintosh 21 display
but what are YOUR experiences
