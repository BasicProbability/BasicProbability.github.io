Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding
fpu  In all Mac price lists Ive seen every C650 as the message fpu
optional  I know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all
C650 have the fpu built in except the 480 configuration  Why would they
be so unclear about this issue in their price list 

Perhaps the reason is simplemaybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists werent clear on the FPU issue 

Afterall Apples literature is not always 100 correct A funny one I
noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
capability refer to the auto inkjet feature This should have read auto
inject feature as it does on some other correct brochures Ive seen from
Apple Since it was correct on some older brochures I can only guess
that someone edited the copy saw inject and thought it was a typo and
changed it to the more familiar word inkjet

Hmmm what would that be A printer built into the CD player A way of
writing information to a CD
