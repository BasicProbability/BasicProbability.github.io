Subject Video Display


   My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad
or video card is bad
   I checked my monitor it works fine with other Mac
   I checked my video card its also fine
   I replaced all the RAMs it still didnt give me right answer
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard

   I dont know hardware architecture of the Macintosh

   Can anyone tell me whats the problem 

   Its a Mac IIcx


   MANY THANKS IN ADVANCE
