Subject Re Stereo sound problem  on mac games

In 1qsfakskcnetworkucsdedu dpbsdchemw2ucsdedu Doug P Book writes

But the following games only play out of the left channel



But still STEREO system beeps do play in stereo through BOTH speakers

Mac sound hardware is diverse some macs play in stereo and
mix the output the SE30 for instance while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker while
some are truly mono like the LC

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard while the right channel isnt Some
send data to both some only send data to the left channel
the first is preferrable of course

Cheers
