Subject Duo 230 slowdown problems

Im a system and network admin One of my users has a Duo 230
specifications below that has been having slowdown problems
Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
unacceptably It can take 1015 seconds to change applications During
this time it is completely hung  If he reboots the problem goes away
For a while It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
configuration

Hes reinstalled System 71 and rebuilt the desktop Neither of these
have helped 

Its possible that its networkrelated he uses Eudora which checks his
email every 10 minutes over Ethernet He hasnt checked to see if this
problem occurs while undocked hes docked most of the time 

Little to no nonApple inits I dont want to start yanking the rest
unless I know that might really be the problem 

He hasnt tried zapping the PRAM I have advised him to do that next

Anyone who has ideas Id love to hear about them Id call Apple but
Ive found theyre best to call during the week its Sunday evening
