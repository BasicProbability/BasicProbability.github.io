 My boss is considering the purchase of a Powerbook or Duo He is leaning
 towards a 180 because of the math coprocessor for Mathematica but would
 get a Duo if he could find a MiniDock with a coprocessor Have any
 thirdparties announced such a beast

   I believe that EMachines might produce something of this nature
