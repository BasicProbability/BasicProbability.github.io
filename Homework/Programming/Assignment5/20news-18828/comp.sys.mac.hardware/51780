Subject SE rom


	I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print 
some grayscale pictures for my kids when I discovered that
grayscaleand photograde are not available if you are
using an SEeven if you are running with an 030 cpu
You wont see this in the printers docs and the Apple
rep didnt mention it to our users group either It seems
that SE ROMs wont support those features Okay I 
guess I should have somehow known that this was the case
Let the buyer beware huh Apple
	Be that as it may I have been thinking about the 
problem and Im puzzled Why  cant a defencieny in the 
ROM be made up for in software I write software for a living
on unix platforms and I dont understand the it just
cant be done responses Ive gotten from those I have
asked so far  Isnt Mode32 or somesuch piece of  soft
ware just such a fix 
	Anyway I was hoping someone knowledgeable
about Mac internals could set me straight is it simply
impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale or could
someone armed with enough info and a little pro
gramming experience cook something up that would
supplement the ROMs capabilities
	Also how does one know if ones mac can
support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300
is supposedly capable of  Short of buying the printer
and trying it out like I did
	Thanks for your help
