 Afterall Apples literature is not always 100 correct A funny one I
 noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
 capability refer to the auto inkjet feature This should have read
auto
 inject feature as it does on some other correct brochures Ive seen
from
 Apple Since it was correct on some older brochures I can only guess
 that someone edited the copy saw inject and thought it was a typo and
 changed it to the more familiar word inkjet
 
 Hmmm what would that be A printer built into the CD player A way of
 writing information to a CD  

How do you think they get the cool images on the top serface of CDs 
anyway  They gotta have something to do the top surface artwork
