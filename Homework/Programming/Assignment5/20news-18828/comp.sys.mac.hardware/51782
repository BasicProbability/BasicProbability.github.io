Subject MO driver compatibility

Its my understanding that when you format a magnetooptical disc 1 the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc 2 if you insert the
disc in a different drive then this driver is loaded into the computers
memory and then controls the drive and 3 if this driver is incompatible
with the drive then the disc can not be mounted andor properly readwritten
Is that correct

Thanks
