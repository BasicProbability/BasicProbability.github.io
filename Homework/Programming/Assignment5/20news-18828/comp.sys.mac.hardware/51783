 	Anyway I was hoping someone knowledgeable
 about Mac internals could set me straight is it simply
 impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale or could
 someone armed with enough info and a little pro
 gramming experience cook something up that would
 supplement the ROMs capabilities
 	Also how does one know if ones mac can
 support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300
 is supposedly capable of  Short of buying the printer
 and trying it out like I did
 	Thanks for your help

To use the grayscale features I believe you need a Mac equipped
with colour quickdraw I was told this somewhere or other but its
not mentioned in Apple Facts guide for apple sellers in the
press release or in the technical specs
