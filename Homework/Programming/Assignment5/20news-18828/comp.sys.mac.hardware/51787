A friend asked me to build a cable to connect an HP fetal heart monitor
to a Maciontosh SE30  No problem sez I


I wanted to demo it on my PB 170 it wont work

The PB has been used running ZTerm and kermit using both internal and external
modems so I dont think its the powerbook per se

When I send a 51 to the HP it responds with 55AA  a test of the serial
ports  It works on the SE30 but not on the PB170

I thought that the SE30 is connected to earth ground and so is the HP So I
connected from the chassis of the HP to the PW audio ground connector still
NG

Any thoughts

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to 
serial port weirdness  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX
handheld  Everything else worked okay on that port but not the HP it runs
on two penlite batteries  It turned out that the plus by accident or by 
design flaw was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
weird things to the HP which has only 3v dc  The HP worked fine when 
connected to the printer port  

Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device  Have you 
tried using the printer port

Good luck
