  Hi I own an LCIII and I recently heard an interesting rumor
  I heard that the LCIII has a built in slot for a PowerPC chip
  Is this true I heard that the slot is not the same as the PDS
  slot  Is that true
 
  Thanks

 Well I also have an LC III  Popping the top revealed

       One socket for an additional VRAM SIMM

       One socket for a 72pin RAM SIMM

       One socket for a flatpack FPU

       A processordirect slot PDS identical to the LCLC II but with
       an additional set of connetions to one side for the full 32bit
       data path that the LCLC II lacked

 Thats it  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
 in the PDS but thats the only place

So will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade or will it
require a logic board swap It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPUs 680x0 like RocketShare But I
guess thats getting a bit fantastic

I was wondering since MacWeek reported that developers were seeded with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card

Also any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed Last I heard the
estimates were around 34 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q1 94 but I doubt its true

Finally is the PowerPC developers CD minicourse available I saw it
advertised in the developers university calendar and Id like to know if its
at all interesting

Radius speculated publicly that they could provide a PowerPCbased
Rocket for existing Macs It would have the plus of RocketShare and
the minus of NuBus accelerators  no true boot off the accelerator
NuBus bottleneck to video and other IO

Apple it seems will not compete with third parties here  except
perhaps for notyetavailable Macs like Cyclone where a PowerPC
slot might be advertised Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC
accelerators

One potential problem with any accelerator though is that it will
need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius with
Rocketshare to use any of its proprietary code

Apple is between the lines trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs
will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC
and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in
existing 68040 Macs Perhaps then well see groundbreaking
prices in Maclogic board upgrades much the same way weve seen
much cheaper highperformance CPUs this year

First generation PowerPCs 98601s will also hopefully have socketed
CPUs so that theyll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later
This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled
for clock doublers If there is too much technical   baggage which
I doubt since the external busses are the same sizewidth to do
this perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard a la Powerbook as
standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades This is an area where
Apple has fallen far behing the Intelbased world Perhaps catchup
is in order

By the way last weeks PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC
Pentium MIPS R4000 DEC Alpha the big four on the microprocessor
front for the forseeable future Worth reading for technojunkies
Also the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium Read it and all
the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent
right now

Once anyone is this secure they are due to fall Intels market
position will never again be as dominant as it is today especially
if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it
might The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome
battle Apple users should be excited that PowerPC while not
guaranteed dominance is a guaranteed winner even if its one of
several
