 Are there any graphics cards for the SE30 that also have say an 040
 accelerator  There seem to be plenty of acceleratorgraphics cards for
 the SE but none that Ive seen for the SE30
 

The DayStar PowerCache for the SE30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated
CPU plus the powercache  This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card
Currenty DayStar does not have the 040 in this configuration but it is
due out early next year  With their upgrade policy you can get the 030
accelerator now and when the 040 version becomes available you get
credit
for the one you have  

I am running their 50 MHz version with FPU along with a Radius Precision
Color Pivot and Im very satisfied
