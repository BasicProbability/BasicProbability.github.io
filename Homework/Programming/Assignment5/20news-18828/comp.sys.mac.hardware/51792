Subject Re PC Syquest on a Mac

In 1qsk6ud8lusenetINSCWRUEdu rcs8poCWRUEdu Robert C Sprecher writes


Is it possible ie via creative cable splicing or whatever to
hook a Syquest 44MB removable drive to a Mac

Is there any difference with the guts of the drive or is it
just cable differences

Thanks

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBMPC and Mac
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself but with
the correct software each can read the others and maybe the cable
depends on your SCSI board on IBMPC

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBMformatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBMPC
syquest

good luck

Paul
