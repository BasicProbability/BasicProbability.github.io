As the author of DPI on the Fry I can tell you that there is no way
for a
graphics card to know what resolution its connected monitor will actually
support  Thats why we have these silly cables  The cable just
identifies
that monitor as supporting a given resolution

Therefore the software will support any multisync monitor  Ive heard
that
radius has a similar program for the quadra

Is this software available either commercially or public domain If so
