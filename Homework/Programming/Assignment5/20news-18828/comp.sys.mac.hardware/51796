Subject what size vram simm is this

Hi everyone I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my
new LCIII and someone responded that it may not actually be bad but it may
be a 512K LC vram chip and thus doesnt work properly with my computer So
Im wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me so I can figure
out what type of chip MacConnection sent me

Each chip says M518121A80J
		 2515251

On the back of the card it says 0593

I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip but I cant figure
out what the size is supposed to be If anyone can help Id be grateful
Please email me your response Thanks a lot
