networked together using Appletalk and PhoneNet connectors To chat we use a
program called Broadcast With it we can send brief messages to all or
selected machines within the network

If you use System 7 you can use my application Zing which has
a 30 kB footprint meaning you can have it running all the time
without losing memory

It is also compatible with the chat program FishBomb which allows
sounds and pictures as well

Both are as far as I know freeware I dustribute Zing with source
and should be available on the normal services macarchiveumichedu
for instance

Cheers
