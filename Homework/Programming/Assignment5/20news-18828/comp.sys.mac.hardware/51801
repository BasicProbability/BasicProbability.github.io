Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for C650 regarding
fpu  In all Mac price lists Ive seen every C650 as the message fpu
optional  I know from what weve discussed in this newsgroup that all
C650 have the fpu built in except the 480 configuration  Why would they
be so unclear about this issue in their price list 

Perhaps the reason is simplemaybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists werent clear on the FPU issue 

Perhaps the marketing people dont KNOW what an FPU is
