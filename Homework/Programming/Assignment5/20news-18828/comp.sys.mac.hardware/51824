 Here is the story
 I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk One of them has an
 Ethernet Card and is currently connected to a NeXT dont laugh
 I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi The NeXT is connected
 to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem
 
 Currently we can telnet from the Mac w Ethernet to the NeXT
 and then telnet out again to the rest of the world
 
 What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
 will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
 via the Ethernet Mac From what we have heard AIR doesnt do
 the trick
 
 Software solutions would be good too but my impression is that
 there arent going to be any
 
 Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
 out again The SLIP connection doesnt allow us to assign IP numbers
 to machines so everyone shares that 1 numberoh well
 

  What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRouteTCP made by
Compatable Systems 1400  This will allow you to connect your Localtalk
network 4 Macs to your Ethernet network NeXT and Ethernet Mac  It will
route TCPIP protocol between the two networks  Software routers are also
available for less money but Im not sure if they work with TCPIP
