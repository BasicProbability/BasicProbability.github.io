Subject When is Apple going to ship CD300is

I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM
drives for my c650 but my local Apple doesnt know 
when they will be available  He doesnt even have a part
number yet   Does anyone know what the part number 
for this drive is and when it will be available

My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external
drives but I dont want to pay extra for a casepower supply
Im not going to use
