Ive seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines
all with 17 Mb RAM installed 70 or 80 ns SIMMs

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
on the screen  The lines translate to the top of the screen and
have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings they
are a few millimeters apart
I admit that they are vague but they can still be distinguished clearly
especially if the environment ie the rest of the room is a bit dark
Applications which produce this effect are
 the previewer of DirectTeX 12 ie DVIReader 12
 Kaleidagraph 211FPU

Another program which produces this effect is
 SpyGlass Transform 21 while contouring a big 257257 array

Thanks for any information about this problem
