Subject Re PDS vs Nubus was Re LC III NuBus Capable

In article 1qt3vd802morrowstanfordedu HKMLRforsythestanfordedu Mark Rogowsky writes

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at
least three Macs the SE30 IIsi and Centris 610 They have not to
my knowledge announced such a device for the LCII but they could
make one technologically

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs

Why though does anyone care about this dgr has a threePDS
adapter for the LCLCII They will soon have one for the LCIII PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications Granted
there are more NuBus cards But most applications that require a
NuBus card like fullmotion video capture shouldnt be done on an
LCLCIILCIII anyway

Mark


NuBus is a much more robust system for system for installing multiple
cards without configuration problems  I know that when I was checking
into expasion options for an SI there were a number of PDS video cards
that would not work with certian Dual slot cache adapters
