 I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM
 drives for my c650 but my local Apple doesnt know 
 when they will be available  He doesnt even have a part
 number yet   Does anyone know what the part number 
 for this drive is and when it will be available
 
 My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external
 drives but I dont want to pay extra for a casepower supply
 Im not going to use

The CD300 external is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  
now  Demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare  Ive seen them  
listed for around 525550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac  
reseller  Ive also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CDs  
but I cant confirm it
