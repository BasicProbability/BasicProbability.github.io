Subject Accelerating the MacPlus

Were about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating
our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers Yes indeed difficult
to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus but thats another
story Suffuce it to say we can get accelerators easier than new machines
Hey I dont make the rules

Anyway on to the purpose of this post Im looking for info on MacPlus
acelerators  So far Ive found some lit on the Novy Accelerator and the
MicrMac MultiSpeed Accelartor Both look acceptable but I would like to hear
from anyone who has tried these  Also if someone would recommend another
accelerator for the MacPlus Id like to hear about it

Thanks for any time and effort you expend on this
