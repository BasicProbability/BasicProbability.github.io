Subject Q buying Advice

Does anyone have a version of Which Mac Do I Buy
that is later than v 131

I no longer have access the ZiffNetMac accessed
through CompuServe to check for myself

Which Mac is a HyperCard stack that assists
in decision making based on budget features and
main software used

Please let me know if you can help me out Download
from CompuServe should not cost much if a higher speed
modem is used Stack compressed is about 125KB

Thanks for any help
