 Hi I bought a while ago a Cache Card w FPU from Techworks It was 219
 I think that was the cheapest I ever saw

As of last week Macs Place had the Applied Engineering QuickSilver card
32k cache one PDS slot socket for FPU on sale for 9900 without FPU
Regular price is 199

No idea if this is still going on but I can get the phone no if anyone is
interested I found their ad in MacUser

Jim Burmeister no relation to Macs Place except as a satisfied customer
