Subject I need modem selection help especially vocabulary

Ive recently ordered a Centris 650 and need to decide on which modem to
buy  Im pretty sure I want to get a faxdata modem that can run at 144k
but is it worth it  Ill primarily only be conversing over CompuServe or
some other link to the Internet but Im not sure if those systems can
supply ME with data at 144k  Another question I have is in some of the
modem lingo out there  I understand baud rates but what does V34 and
V34bis mean  I could really use some suggestions as to what a good modem
for around 300 would be and why it would be a good choice

Thanks for your time
