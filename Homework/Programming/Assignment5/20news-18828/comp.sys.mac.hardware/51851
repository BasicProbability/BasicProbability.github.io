Subject Re PC Syquest on a Mac

In article 1qsk6ud8lusenetINSCWRUEdu rcs8poCWRUEdu Robert C Sprecher writes

Is it possible ie via creative cable splicing or whatever to
hook a Syquest 44MB removable drive to a Mac

Is there any difference with the guts of the drive or is it
just cable differences

Thanks

Many Companies package Syquest drives for the mac already So unless you
are using one for the IBM world Id buy a Mac ready Config
