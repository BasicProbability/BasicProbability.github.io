  I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM
  drives for my c650 but my local Apple doesnt know 
  when they will be available  He doesnt even have a part
  number yet   Does anyone know what the part number 
  for this drive is and when it will be available
  
  My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external
  drives but I dont want to pay extra for a casepower supply
  Im not going to use

			  While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive I have seen
a part number for the bezel kit a new front panel with the slot in it
through which you insert the CD The document which I got from the
21093 announcement at our Apple office states the drive kit and bezel
kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of 149 fro the C650
The external unit may be a better deal after all
