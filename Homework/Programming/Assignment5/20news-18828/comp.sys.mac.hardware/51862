Subject Buying a high speed veverything modem

Just a quick summary of recent findings re high speed modems Top three
contenders seem to be ATT Paradyne ZyXEL and US Robotics ZyXEL has the
biggest cult following and can be had for under 300 but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software which will work without any
tweaking

The ATT Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability They are
backordered at the moment probably because of the special 299 price in
effect until May Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems WARNING ATT ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit cables 
all and has lifetime warranty This applies only when you order
directly from Paradyne I called ElekTek one of the distributors and
they wanted to charge me 16 for cable and gave only 1 year warranty

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly but not as highly recommended
its only 250 from ClubMac and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and dont care about the FAXstf software you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for 190

All this assuming that you dont have a rich uncle and cant afford a
Motorola Codex      I ended up ordering the Dataport well see how
it works in two weeks or so
