Subject Re Whither QuickDraw Performance across product line

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the
drumroll please LCIII  And the Color Classic ranks right up there with
the Quadra line  The Centris line pales in comparison

Does anybody know the differences in these computers that explains the
disparity in graphicsprocessor performance

I think you are suffering from some alignment or color
table or whatever problems if a Color Classic is as fast
as a Quadra rendering to screen

What screen card you use does of course matter much builtin
video is almost always faster than NuBus

Or you measured scroll entire screen where the Color Classic
had a VRAM 10 screen in 4bit color and the Quadra had a
21 24bit screen on NuBus 

Cheers
