Subject Re When is Apple going to ship CD300is

sunnytcodingbchsuhedu writes

The CD300 external is already shipping and has been shipping for
quite awhile now
Demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare

Hm Ive got my CD drive since 921230

Ive also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CDs  
but I cant confirm it

Indeed CDs are bundled with it
You usually get nine CDs with demos of applications games photos etc

I have compiled a list of these and posted it to altcdrom
I will post an updated version of this list RSN
