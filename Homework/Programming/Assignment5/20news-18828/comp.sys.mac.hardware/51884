 My boss is considering the purchase of a Powerbook or Duo He is leaning
 towards a 180 because of the math coprocessor for Mathematica but would
 get a Duo if he could find a MiniDock with a coprocessor Have any
 thirdparties announced such a beast

   I believe that EMachines might produce something of this nature
 

  Yes EMachines makes two minidocksthe Powerlink Presente and the
PowerLink DeskNet The Presenter offers a variety of videoout options 
including NTSC RGB and SVGA It also has sound out floppy drive port
and a power port Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port
  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus builtin EtherNet Alas none of
these have an FPU
  In the future RasterOps is putting out a minidock but the name escapes
me now It is supposed to support 16bit color and Quadra comparable
video speed No idea if it has an FPU
  Hope this helps
