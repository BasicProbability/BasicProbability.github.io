 A friend of mine has problems running Spigot LC on an LC III
 His configuration is

 Spigot LC  LC III System 71
 Video Spigot Extension 10

 I would appriciate if I can get any postitivenegative experience with this
 setup

Somebody in compmultimedia was also having trouble using a Spigot in his
LC III It turned out he needed the latest version of ScreenPlay 111
which fixed things
