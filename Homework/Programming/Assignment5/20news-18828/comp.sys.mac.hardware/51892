Subject Mac  IBM InfoVersion 177

Send follow ups to compsysmacadvocacy Sorry about the header but the 
Pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and I gave up after a 
year of trying This sheet is also available by FTP on sumexaimstanfordedu 
364406 in the infomacreport as macibmcompare177txt
Mac  IBM InfoVersion 177

The reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the 
information out there so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate 
about what they are saying about their machines  Since computer technology 
is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will 
be lacking or incorrect on information  So please just dont say the sheet 
is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to 
make the needed corrections  All prices are in US dollars
To keep this data sheet organized please provide if possible article 
citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to 
a minimum  As this is a general data sheet keep the info provided simple so 
I can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others 
Finally keep the information relevant to the section corrected For example 
OS code in ROM is software contained in hardware so no more of the but it 
is supported in OS disk software data for the hardware section please 
Thank you
Note  for proper reading off line this document should be in 9 point Monaco

The CPUs
 Note I am only showing Motorola  Intel CPUs used in Mac and most IBMPC 
clone machines For example since Apple never used the Motorola 68008 and 
68010 in the Mac these chips are not listed Years only appear with dead CPUs 
and indicate first to last year used as a CPU
Cache note  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs These external 
caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it  In most of 
the present Macs there are external caches builtin while with IBM they are 
optional Though machines are generally sold with them installed  Since 
there are many different external caches CPUMac and IBM SCSI video disk 
and static RAMMac each having a different effect on CPU performance and 
they are machine 32KB static RAM cache in IIci IIfx and IIvx seller 
cache card installed in some IIcis or expansion IIci cache cards go up to 
128KB dependent I have decided to leave them out of the list

The 040 has 2 clocks an internal processor clock PCLK that is 2x freq of 
external bus clock BCLK which is the one used to rate the chips 
Bradley Lamont Motorola 68040 data book  Some compilers produce programs 
sensitive to the PCLK and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler 
chip but this very compiler and program dependent  Compliers maybe written 
to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040s PCLK in the 
future  As it is now studies such as one in a Byte article which showed 
04025 48650 and roughly 486dx250 are very dependent on the machine OS 
and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance

CPUs Comparison List
As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the 
same frequency 03025  38633 04025  486dx50 but Intel has chips at 
higher frequencies than Motorola so this evens out  The Macintosh Bible 4th 
ed supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020 
and above

80186     68000 16bit vs 162432bit chip data pathaddress 
linesdata  address registers  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it 
down to the 80186 and lower chips otherwise it would compare to the 80286

286         68020 hardware segmenting vs 68020s 32bit ALU and these chips 
come have no usable builtin MMU unlike their successors 80386 68030  The 
hardware segmentings protected mode is used by OS2 10  and Windows 3X 
The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16bit nature put the 286 between 
the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LCs 16bit data path strenghthens the 
286  68020 comparison

386        68030 Two 32bit chips with MMUs and protected memory  AUX 30 
is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030s protected memory feature for 
apps  System 7x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the 
Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras  
The Color Classic and LCII 16bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them 
comparative to 386sxs

486sx    68LC040 same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU used as a low cost 
solution for people who do not need the FPU  Only with programs sensitive to  
PCLK  pipelining does the 68LC040 behave like 486dx2  FPU or a 486dx2sx

486      68040 two 32bit microprocessors with builtin FPU MMU 8K 
internal cache which is implemented as two 4K caches in the 68040 and one in 
the 486  Only with programs sensitive to PCLK  pipelining does the 68040 
behave like a 486dx2

Pentium    68060 Both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat

Hardware 
In an effort to remove the reconfiguring the system almost every time you 
add something requirement for addin cards drivers video and operating 
systems in the IBM world Intel Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software

Color SupportDisplay
 Mac 3024 MHz Pixel Clock standard  All present Macs support the use of 
32bit color through 32bit color QuickDraw in ROM  32bit color QuickDraw 
allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit Xbit images in Y
bit color and retain ALL the colors of Ybit color Where X and Y 
independently are 1 2 4 8 16 or 32 regardless of monitor resolution 63 
dpi 12 color to 94 dpi PaletteBook or monitor type including 
autosynchronous VGA MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 667 hz 
vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor MacUser 
Aug 1992 158176  Older machines that supported color SE30 II IIX and 
IIcx had only 8bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32bit 
color MacUser Special 19932829  
To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display 
capability builtin but most of those can be expanded to display 24bit 
color    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display QuickDraw QX 
will change this
In addition QuickDraw allows in Macs with a NuBus slot more then one 
monitor to be used in any combination from two monitors showing the same 
thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
of overlap of the pictures
VRAM Video RAM  Standard for present nonPowerBook Macs handling of 
 builtin video from a 32bit color palette VRAM provided runs a 8bit
 color 640x480 display expandable to 16bit color or a 8bit 832x624 display 
Sound output  Standard in all Macs since the 128K  Stereo sound became 
 standard with the SE30

IBM  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system 
interacts with the video hardware Nan Zou the use of drivers bypassing 
BIOS video hareware inconsitancies see Super VGA below and nonstanderzation
of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware OS and program 
interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question Faisal Nameer 
Jawdat In addition IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
actually present Matt Healy nor a standardized screendrawing toolbox like 
Macs QD As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes 
especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly At present 
things are so dependent on the interaction of the program OS print driver 
and monitor card that editing 32bit pictures regardless of color mode OS 
and monitor typecard combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with 
an IBM  For example one cannot edit a 32bit color picture done on a OS2 
486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA 18bit color palette and DOS 50 
and still have ALL the colors one started out with
Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators faster 
processors and modular upgradeability and may have builtin sound cards CD

 Common on the initial PS1 implementation from IBM and some PS2 Models
SVGA  Super VGA
 This is not a standard in the way the others were but instead was a catch 
 all category for a group of video cards  As such with each manufacturer 
 using their own implementation scheme SVGA was chaos with people debating
 as to what is SVGA and what is not  In an effort to make SVGA more of a 
 standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units but things
 are still a mess  Video is either 512K 1990 or 1M today resolution
 of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common newer ones since 
 1990 have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC giving 15bit 32768 colors at 800x600 
 some of the very newer ones 692 can do 24 bits per pixel usually 
 at 640x480  Speedwise too much variation some very slow Western Digital 
 Paradise based for example some very fast S3 86C911 based for example 
 some are soso like Tseng ET4000 a very popular chipset  Some limiting 
 factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus  386s linear address mapping were 
 833 MHz ISA bus AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 
 64K window etc
Other nonSVGA standards 
8514a
 IBMs own standard interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions 
 like linedraw polygon fill etc in hardware Some clone implementations 
 from ATI are the fastest video available today though some clone models do 
 not have interlacing 
TMS3401034020 high end graphics coprocessors usually 1000 some
 do 24bit speeds up vectororiented graphics like CAD
XGA  eXtended Graphics Array
 newer and faster than 8514a only available for MCA busbased PS2s clones 
 are coming out soon  Emulates VGA EGA and CGA DCT  Max resolution at 
 1024x768x8b same as 8514a also some 16 bpp modes
XGA2
 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in
 Windows and OS2 including line draws bit and pixelblock transfers area
 fills masking and XY addressing Has an intelligent way to detect and co
 exist with other XGA2 cards so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be 
 far away  Since this is an architecture its resolution and color depth 
 isnt fixed IBM implements only 16bit 65536 color while other 
 companies can have 24bit color through IBM technical licenses Refresh 
 rates up to 75 Hz ensures flicker free rock solid images to reduce visual 
 discomfort and is VGA compatible Up to 1280x1024 on OS2
some monitor types usable by MacSee Mac section above for specific details

Expansion
Both Mac  IBM
SCSI only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM
 Allows the use of any device hard drive printer scanner Nubus card 
 expansion Mac Plus only some monitors and CDROM  
 Main problem  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM 
SCSI1  7 devices per SCSI controller  8bit asynchronous 15MBs ave
 and synchronous 5MBs max transfers  Difference is due to SCSI1 software
 drivers  Fast SCSI1 is a misname for 8bit SCSI2 in SCSI1 mode
 see SCSI2 for details
SCSI2 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI2 mode  SCSI2 is fully
 SCSI1 compliant and 8bit SCSI2 tends to be implemented as a very fast
 SCSI1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
 hardware and software that 16 and 32bit SCSI2 do  Transfer speeds are
 46MBs with 10MBs burst 8bit 812MBs with 20MBs burst 16bit and
 1520MBs with 40MBs burst 32bitwide and fast  Since 8bit SCSI2 can
 use SCSI1 software drivers and hardware at 8bit SCSI2 speeds and as such
 is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called fast SCSI1 
 16bit fast SCSI2 requires a SCSI2 software driver and SCSI2 electronics
 but can still use the SCSI1 ports  Wide 16bit and 32bit SCSI2 require a
 different SCSI port electronics and software driver from SCSI1 Which
 makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces
Mac SCSI asynchronous SCSI1 builtin standard since the Plus  Even though 
 Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers the OS SCSI Manager
 needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI
 interfaces  As a result present SCSI2 Macs use 8bit SCSI2 as a fast 
 asynchronous SCSI1  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI2
 controller chip builtin Digital Review Oct 21 1991 v8 n33 p81 
 though they lack some other parts of the hardware like the wide SCSI2 port 
 interface  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI2 older NuBus 
 Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU  Rumorsome
 Cyclone Macs June will come with a wide  fast SCSI2 port standard 
 and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager
IBM SCSI  SCSI1 is not too wide spread yet generally not bundled with 
 systems except as addon EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable
 Like the Mac 8bit SCSI2 is used as a very fast SCSI1 by most controllers
 out there  Unlike the Mac IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications
 which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI

Mac
Memory expansion with a few exceptions the Mac has used nonparity 30pin 
 8bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus  While 32pin 9bit parity SIMMs
 could be used in these Macs only special IIcis could make use of the parity 
 feature By convension both SIMM types are called 32pin SIMMs  The IIfx 
 used 64pin parity SIMMs  The LC III C610650 and Q800 all use a new 
 72pin SIMM that is accessable by 32bits at a time and is used in IBMs
 The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writingreading every
 memory location if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is
 Since Macs made before Feb 15 1993 managed memory baced on data path SIMMs 
 had to be installed in pairs 16bit or in sets of 4 32bit  The Centris 
 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
 allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time  If the SIMMs are the same 
 size are used then the memory is interleaved across the two SIMMs resulting 
 in a 1015 performance boost on RAM access MacWorld Apr 93 108109

 the same time  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to 
 dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved Each 
 NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 
 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard

IBM

512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM  This allows 
Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS QuickDraw 
menu commands print mouse SCSI  sound drivers etc in ROM which require 
clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks Which requires 
access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM 
chips Plus vs Classic for example  With key hooks for the OS support 
interface in ROM programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS 
has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and 
therefore can write smaller programs  This also allows Apple greater control 
over hardwaresoftware standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and with 
some of the tookbox command code in ROM with lower RAM requirements then a 
totally disk based OS  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM Jon

 The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system 
 fonts from the previous system inside the system file  This can eat up any 
 RAM benefits and cause other problems  Apple itself recommends removing all

Note sound output was supported in OSes 32 to 605 by many formats 
including the following  snd WAVE ASND FSSD QSSN SMSD SOUN dc2d and 
DCFL  In 607 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards snd 
and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats though most 
still play

IBM
 Machiness have little GUI code data and hooks present in hardware for 
programmers to work with so most of the coding must be provided in the OS  
Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM  In addition 
what little ROM code there is also read into RAM a process called Shadow ROM  
This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or 
EPROMS  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to 
better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which 
is harder with a ROM based system due to the patches needed  In addition it 
reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware 
support is needed
Side note  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing 
all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing 
its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS2 Undocumented Windows and 
There is deliberate code in Windows NT Beta which causes the install to 
abort if OS2 Boot Manager is present Gregory Hicks InfoIBMPC Digest V92 
201  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC 
judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no 
action  Rumorsthe FTC will presue the matter likely to the point of 
choosing a new member or whole new council  In addition the government has 
turned down Microsofts copyright of Windows which would allow it to charge 
a fee for developers using their hooks PC Week 030893

OS Number Crunching Mel Park
Mac
 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise Exceptions such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner 10 produces the internal 
representation for infinity INF  110 produces zero The above treatment 
of 110 occurs in an FPUequipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly

IBM
 Floating point numbers are 80bits with a hardware FPU 64bits when 
emulated  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts 10 and 110 would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured  Most present compilers handle this 
better  Result there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS 
Windows and OS2 programs nor between programs for just one OS

Networking Includes printing
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer
Mac
Hardware Builtin LocalTalk network port and a builtin printer port  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds 2304 Kbs requires special connectors for 
each machine 15 and up and can be run off of either the printer port to 
include very old macs or the network port standard today  Builtin 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about 150300 for each machine  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers thick thin and 10BaseT for Ethernet
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard with transceivers available TokenRing has been a 
network option since 1989
Software AppleTalk the suite of protocols standard with Mac OS which can 
use variety of media types  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware 3Com 3Open 
Banyan Vines DEC Pathworks Apples AppleShare servers System 7 File Sharing 
machines and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts  MacTCP allows 
typical TCPIP communications telnet ftp NFS rlogin  A later version 
will have Unix XOpen Transport Interface XTI builtin by the end of 1993 
MacWeek 041293  Thirdparty software to connect to NFS servers  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support  Peertopeer file sharing software 
builtin to System 71 See OS section  Full server software is extra 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser  The same is true of connecting to servers
Printing bugs  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font
 QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems

IBM  
Hardware LocalTalk not widely used Ethernet  and TokenRing
Software Novell Netware Banyan Vines DECNet WindowsWork Groups AppleTalk 
protocols and AppleShare subset of AppleTalk
Each of the MSDOS networking schemes are in general totally incompatible 
with the others Once you have chosen one you are pretty much lockedin to 
that product line from then on  WindowsWork Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem  Novell Netware is the biggest 
80 percent of the corporate market and in general is more powerful and 
offers better controlmanagementsecurity than AppleShare but its also more 
complex to set up and manage  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell PC Week 121492  122892  
InfoWorld Dec 1492 MacWeek 32293
Printing Very OS dependent
DOS If its a single user then you plug the printer into the parallel port 
 and dont worry about it Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software  Network Printing is not controlled by the system but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next
Windows 3x supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing jobs 
 in the print queue but it always lists printers as active even if they 
 are not  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net because theres no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now  Windows for Workgroups is more Maclike 
 and intelligent about this
OS2 Maclike the os deals with printers with apps making calls to the OS
Printing bugs due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved

Price issue This is very dynamic with Mac providing more buildin features 
than IBM and IBM being more get only what you need then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds
The IBM machines modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM builtin inputoutput sound support SCSI PDS  
builtin monitor support builtin networking standard mouse interface and 
NuBus 90 in higher machines the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Macs cost MacUser Aug 1992158176
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993
All Macs below come with a PDS slot VRAM and SCSI1 built in  Except where 
noted monitor is extra and a builtin monitor interface is provided no card 
needed except for 24bit color display
