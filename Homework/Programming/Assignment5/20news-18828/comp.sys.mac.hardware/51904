Subject Re Quadra SCSI Problems

 ATTENTION Mac Quadra owners Many storage industry experts have
 concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating
 from the standard SCSI specification This results in silent corruption
 of data when used with some devices including ultramodern devices
 Although I will not name the devices since it is not their fault an
 example would be a Sony 35 inch MO without the special Maccompatible
 firmware installed One solution sometimes is to disable blind writes
 
To the best of my knowledge there arent any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didnt test their driver with the device in question
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of 16µsec occur
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can hiccup in the middle of blocks  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didnt
pay attention to the errors coming back

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasnt been clocked yet  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesnt crash the machine
