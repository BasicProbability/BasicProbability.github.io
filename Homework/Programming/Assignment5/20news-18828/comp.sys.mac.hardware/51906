Subject Re Q700 at 345MHz its fine

I have had my Q700 running with a 66666 MHz osc for a few months I have a
number of SCSI devices connected Quantum LP52 Maxtor 213 Toshiba MK156F via
Emulex adapter Pioneer DRM600 and have had no trouble

Is this being done with the motherboards SCSI interface If this is possible
then a bit of experimenting with just plain old clock oscillators may be
in order Give us some more details please
