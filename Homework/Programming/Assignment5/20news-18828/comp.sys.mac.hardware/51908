Subject DeskWriter Drivers 31  How to install 

I recently upgraded to System 71 and now I also upgraded my
DeskWriter drivers from 22 to 31  I got the software from Sumex
but it is not clear to me where to install what

Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW31 go where
and for what purpose  What can be left out for instance if
you dont want to do background printing

Thanks

	Tom
