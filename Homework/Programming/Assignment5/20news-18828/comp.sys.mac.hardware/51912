Subject Re Monitor Shutdown on 13 HiRes
From sadamseiscalstateedu Steven Adams

Just my luck  I did however call my local Apple dealer and he said that
the he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin
with either 70 or 5356 and maybe one other  He also told me that Apple
had extended the service on these serial numbers for another year  

So there is still hope  Get those monitor in

  THere is a defect in the 13 hires monitors bring it to a dealer and

 The service notice on the 13 hires monitors expired 32393 after this  
 date Apple will NOT reimburse service providers for the fix replacement  
 of the hivoltage capacitor All you folks that have been putting up with  
 intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
 out on the freebie It was in force for a year If you got it free after  
 323 you got a deal
