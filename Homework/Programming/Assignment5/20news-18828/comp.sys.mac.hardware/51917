with Color Quickdraw  but they wont and 3rd parties are having a difficult 

There is one reason market size

The market size for color quickdraw for accellerated plusses and
SEs which dont go beyond 4 MB anyway is just too small the
extra cost would belike 1000 and with that money you can buy a
color classic instead
