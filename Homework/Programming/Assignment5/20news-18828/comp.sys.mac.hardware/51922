 Is there a fix for this We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup
 unless there is a monitor connected This would be no problem but since
 were running it as a file server there is no need to have a monitor
 connected all the time

Ive seen a control panel made for this I dont remember the name where I
saw it or on what Quadra models it will work But I do know it exists
