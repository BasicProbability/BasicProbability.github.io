I am looking for a 8 meg 72pin SIMM for my Centris 610  Where is the
best place to purchase one stock shipping warrenty and if
possible phone numbers so that I can order one as soon as possible

  Try Goldstar They make them and they are available immediately in Mac
configurations I ordered a pair from Computerland 8 meg variety and
they work like a charm Ive had them for two weeks
