The ATT Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability They are
backordered at the moment probably because of the special 299 price in
effect until May Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems WARNING ATT ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit cables 
all and has lifetime warranty This applies only when you order
directly from Paradyne I called ElekTek one of the distributors and
they wanted to charge me 16 for cable and gave only 1 year warranty


Hmm I dont know where this information concerning the cable and the
warranty came from but I ordered mine from Logos Communications near
Cleveland and inside was a Mac cable with the correct pin connections 
and a lifetime warranty  The whole package was assembled at ATT Paradyne
and every piece the serial cable the telephone cable etc had ATT 
part numbers on them except the QuickLink software package and the 
CompuServe intro kit

If anyones interested Logos number is 800 8377777  I ordered mine
last Wednesday and got my modem on Friday though its not to far from
Cleveland to Pittsburgh   On the down side they only ship UPS COD
