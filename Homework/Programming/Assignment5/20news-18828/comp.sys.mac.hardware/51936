Subject Good HardDisk driver for nonApple drives Sys 71 compat


Hi there

What is your recommendation for a good harddisk driver software for
nonApple drives I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
drive but maybe for some normal drives too
I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining but dont know
any competitors It does not need to be fancy filled with features
I more like it affordable

Thanks
