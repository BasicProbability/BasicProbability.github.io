Subject Re Cache card for IIsi

 Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they
 get with the cards I have only one report which seems to indicate
 that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1 speedup 

Ok  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache
Its small enough that I will attach it

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache  The speedup varies a lot from app to app ranging from 0 to
40  I think an average of 2025 is about right  The subjective
difference is not great but is sometimes noticable  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better  I do not have an FPU

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under 150  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it

If you get complete speedometer runs for a 32K cache Id like to
see them  Lets check the conventional wisdom  The so called
Performance Rating numbers by themselves are of no interest 

Cheers
