AROSE  Apple Real Time Operating System Environment

This is a system extension for these NuBUS cards using the 
MCP  Macintosh Coprocessor Platform The MCPcards are NuBUS cards with a
Motorola 68000Processor and 512 KB RAM expandable to 1 Meg
MCP is a development platform for hardwaredesigners so they can use a card
with an own processor and thus the main processor isnt needed for these cards
Currently the only cards I know are

 the Apple TokenRingCard
 the new Apple EthernetCard
 the Apple NuBUS serial card

Perhaps there are some thirdpartycards but I dont know
