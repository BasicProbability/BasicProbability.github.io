Subject Re IIci ROM Offers 32bit Clean ROM for IIx

In article mdavis735319596crashctscom mdaviscrashctscom Morgan Davis writes

Last weeks MacWEEK article by Ric Ford indicated that David Ramseys
Mac IIx has been running nicely with a Mac IIci ROM in it offering
clean 32bit ROM code liberating his IIx from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by Apples 32bit System Enabler

 This would make me a bit suspect of Mr Ramseys qualifications
as a selfstyled expert in fact when I read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder   

Yes one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM of the 
correct size obviously in an older machine but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when specialcasing  especially timingdependent
and driverrelated stuff

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROMswapping  The Apple 32bit enabler has problems but
MODE32 works just fine with 70 701 and 71

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs  

Sure  Buy a used IIci motherboard  Call PreOwned Electronics
Shreve or other parts dealers see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM  Everything has a price  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard you might
get a decent price  There is probably a market for used mother
boards as well so they might sell a ROM anyway

Needless to say Im interested in purchasing such a ROM  What would
be a reasonably price to offer

Ask for a quote and then try offering less  PreOwned and
Shreve have been known to dicker  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items and their phone quotes tend to vary as well

Still Im not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx
