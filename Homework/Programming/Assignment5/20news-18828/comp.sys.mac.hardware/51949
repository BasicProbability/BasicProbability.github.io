Subject Centris 610 Font Problems

I recently got a Centris 610 4230 on my desk Its a vast improvement on
my previous machine a IIsi 540 However 

Ive encountered a problem with fonts 

Entries in a Filemaker 20 database which looked fine when printed from my
previous mac using System 701 now look wierd 

Spacing between characters has increased greatly  causing lines to be
truncated Im using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes  the
increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles 

Im using a mixture of TrueType and FixedSize fonts  exactly as on my
IIsi  when things worked perfectly

Weve managed to get similar behaviour using Word 51

Apple UK adopted their usual friendly approach and told us to call our
local dealer  God help us 

Any ideas
