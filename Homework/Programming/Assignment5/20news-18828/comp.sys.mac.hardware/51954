Subject Looking for MagnetoOptical drive advice



Im currently trying to select which magnetooptical drive to purchase  Im
primarily looking at 128MB drives although I might consider 256MB ones

When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads the prices for the 128MB drives
seem to range from just under 1000 for the DGR 128REM Portable Magic 128MB
Portable Fujitsu or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect to about 1600 for the
FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO128  Different drives
use different mechanisms  MOST Fujitsu Sony Epson probably some others

My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser
reviews of these drives Im still not sure what to get  So Im asking
if anyone has had goodbad experiences with any 128MB MO drive or can shed
some light on the wide range of prices is spending more really buying me
much reliability of different drives compatibility between them or 
anything else I should probably know

Thanks
