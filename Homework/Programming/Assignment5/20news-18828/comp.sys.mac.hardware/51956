The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC  I
recall there being a conversation here that a 48625 running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7  I dont know if that is
true but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this

That seems about right  I have a Mac IIsi 5130 with 64k cache card running
System 71  My roommate has a 486sx25 5200 running Windows 31 and from
what Ive seen my IIsi is faster in some operations  In others they are
comparableBut keep in mind Im strictly speaking of operations on the
desktop level of Windows 31 and System 71 not actual computational speed
in other programs
