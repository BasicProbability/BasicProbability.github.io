Even better than that  how does a 68000based Amiga 2000 perform in 
daily tasks compared to my 68030based IIci

Answer except in a very few cases I get my butt kicked by the Amiga
Sure there are other considerations but it goes to show you how
proper design from the beginning in hardware and software can give
you great returns  as well as showing you that if you dont have a 
marketing department to speak of no one will care how good your system is

Im still happy with my ci but I dont understand why the performance is
so bad comparatively  They could have done multitasking properly
They could have done everthing else better  but apple didnt
of course DOS 6 and windows 31 are nothin to write home about either

Oh well yall got 200 worth for the price of 002
