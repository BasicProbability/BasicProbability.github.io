  Basically the Mac Pluses are constantly rebooting themselves as if the
  reboot button were being pushed  Sometimes the Mac is able to fully boot
  and display the desktop but it is only a matter of time before it reboots
  again  At times the frequency is as high as several times a minute
 
    I wonder if your Mac has those little RESET  INTERUPT switches
    installed  They are plastic devices that push on the switches which
    are inside the mac  Or mabey those switches are bad and need replacing

I wish I caught the original post but anyway 


The problem is that the Pluss poor old power supply sometimes referred to as
the analog sweep board is on its way out Apart from a board swap bikkies to
Apple theres not much the average Joe can do to fix it

You can of course try and readjust the voltage levels the 5v rail should
be as close to 5v as you cn get it but this is more often than not a
temporary fix A copy of Larry Pinas Macntosh Repair  Upgrade Secrets is a
worthwhile investment for the serious doityaselfer
