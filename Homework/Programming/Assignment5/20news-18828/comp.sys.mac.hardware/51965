Subject Re x86  680x0   How do they compare

I guess the real question is

Who asked the original questions and why was it so broad
Are we talking pure processing power what kind of processing BTW
isolated from every other factor and influence in the system  
Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs yuck

I just finished a project that involves realtime processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface assembly has
a lot to do with the power of a CPU in a particular application
If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given
then not only is it easy but its cheap and quick  If you have to
fake things like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction then
your cycle count goes through the roof

well lets NOT start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose
The orginal question was about classifying microprocessors
having reread the entire thread I dont think much more can be said without
getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given


Thats it for another 002

Cheers everyone
