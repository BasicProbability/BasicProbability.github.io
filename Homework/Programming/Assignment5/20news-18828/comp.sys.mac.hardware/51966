 Hi there
 
 What is your recommendation for a good harddisk driver software for
 nonApple drives I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
 drive but maybe for some normal drives too

FWB distributes HDT Personal Edition HDT  Hard Drive Toolkit which
is what I own This is less fancy than the full version but good
enough for what you and I want to do Casa Blanca offers Drive7 but
Im not that familiar with it I think that both Drive7 and HDT PE
can be had for around US50

Ive used Silverlinging at work v 542 and I like HDT PE much
better IMHO it has a better interface and easier to understand

Any Drive7 users

James
