Subject Pin out of ImageWriter II serial port

Hi

Could some kind soul please email me a copy of the pinout for the serial
connector on an ImageWriter II printer  We have one that wed like to hook
up to a PC and it seems that nobody sells the proper cables anymore  No
problem  I can make one but I need to know the pinout first

Thanks in advance
