  Is there a fix for this We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup
  unless there is a monitor connected This would be no problem but since
  were running it as a file server there is no need to have a monitor
  connected all the time
 
 Ive seen a control panel made for this I dont remember the name where I
 saw it or on what Quadra models it will work But I do know it exists

 I will poke around in the U of M archives and see if I find something If
 anyone else finds this please post the location 

I think I found what your looking for on ftpapplecom in the
dtsmacsyssoftvideo directory and is called Virtual Monitor Switch
