Subject serial pinout to connect to PC

Sorry this must be a FAQ but its a quick fix that I need to take care of  
before a demo in less than 24 hours from now Couldnt think of a better place  
for a rapid answer than compsysmachardware

I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac 38620 PC to the printer port of a  
Mac IIci Does anyone have handy the pinpin routing for the cable that would  
allow this connection 

The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE DB9 How would this map to the DIN8 of  
the Mac serial I tried one of those really short femaleDB9maleDIN8 cables  
that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the  
preMacPlus era This cable didnt do it Do I need a null modem adaptor as  
well on the DB9 side of things 

I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins correctly


thanks kindly
