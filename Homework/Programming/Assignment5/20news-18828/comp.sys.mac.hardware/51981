Subject PC Logitec hand scan on Mac


I have a Logitech 256grays hand scanner from a PC  Im wondering if anyone
has been successful in connecting the scanner to a mac  It has the same
connector and is a serial device on the pc  I can imagine the pins coniguration would need to changeed but Im not sure if the signal levels would be correct
and if the mac sw would work with it  

Of course the manuals say nothing about the interface connector layout or
anything HWish

Any ideas


thanx

Steve
