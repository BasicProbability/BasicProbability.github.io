In article 1r1d2rbafumccumccumichedu dlcumccumccumichedu David Claytor writes
1 System Install
2 Kodak Photo CD sampler
3 Alice to Ocean
4 CDROM Titles
5 Application Demos
6 Mozart Dissonant Quartet
7 Nautilus
8 Apple Chronicles

I assume they get the 8 titles above plus Cinderella and the Games Demo CDROM

My CD300 external just arrived has 28 plus Cinderella  Game Demo
