Subject LCIII Logic Board Rework

I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a rework of the
logic board  I opened mine up and found the same rework with a small
chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two 
other chips  Id like to know more about it  Could anyone with any or all of
the following information please post it  Thanks a bunch

1	What does the rework accomplish ie what does it fix
2	What are the technical details of the rework  Im looking for
	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected
	and the pinouts for those chips
3	Is a board with the rework any different functionally from one without
4	Could the reworked boards be incompatible with future releases of
	the operating system

	and finally

5	Should I even be concerned about any of this
