Subject LC II Slowdowns

        I am currently managing among many other labs a lab with three 
LC IIs a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD and a LaserWriter II NTX My 
problem The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snails pace
        These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM 256K VRAM and a Quantum LP105S HD 
installed I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 13 and 
it gives a very respectable 29 overall rating to this drive so its not 
the drive I have reinstalled System 71 MSWord 51a MSWorks 30 and 
so on all from the master disks In short I have done everything I can 
think of in software I am not a hardware hacker though I pop cases 
fairly often But nothing works
        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable The mouse always 
moves smoothly floppies always run at the same speed but occasionally 
for about 12 hours at a time a machine will run like it was running on 
a 4 MHz 68000 not a 16 MHz 68030 It is VERY frustrating and makes it 
nearly unusable It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity
        Has anyone encountered this problem before Has anyone got any 
ideas They would be much appreciated
