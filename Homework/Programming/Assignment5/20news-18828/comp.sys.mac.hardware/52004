 I HAVE A QUESTION  10
 
  
       Congratulations  Youve come to the right place  Usenet is 
  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions
  How do I lock a floppy disk to queries that would make Steve
  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror  I used
  ResEdit to remove resources Init 11 WDEF 34 and nVIR 17 from my
  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string A67B45 as a
  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box
  would be a nice shade of mauve  Everything worked fine until I
  installed SuperCDevBlaster and now when I use the Aldus driver to
  print from PageMaker 50d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs 
  PS  Im running System 602 on a PowerBook 170 
  
       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume we
  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the
  table of contents for the other pieces of it check any other
  relevant online resources listed below in question 12 especially
  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups and RTFM Read
  the Friendly Manual before posting your question  We realize that
  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen
  of your newlyinstalled twenty megs of RAM but this question has
  already made its way around the world three hundred times before
  and its developing tired feet  Finally before posting to any
  newsgroup Macintosh or otherwise please familiarize yourself
  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup
  newsannouncenewusers


 HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT  WHERE CAN I GET IT  11 
     
         compsysmacfaq is currently divided into multiple pieces
  a general introduction which youre reading now and specific lists
  for the newsgroups compsysmacsystem and compsysmacmisc  FAQ
  lists for compsysmacwanted compsysmacapps and
  compsysmachardware are in development  When ready each part
  will be available in its respective newsgroup  All pieces are
  available via anonymous ftp from rtfmmitedu in the
  pubusenetnewsanswersmacintosh directory Except for this
  document itself which is named generalfaqZ the pieces are named
  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by
  faq eg systemfaqZ miscfaqZ  The Z means the  file is
  stored compressed so youll need to ftp it in binary mode and use
  either MacCompress StuffIt Deluxe or the UNIX uncompress command 
  to decompress it  However if you leave off the Z extension when
   you get the file rtfm will automatically decompress the file
  before sending it to you 
  
         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned
  newsgroups  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ
  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to
  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere
  else in the FAQ even if you dont have the other parts at hand 
  Its not always obvious especially to newcomers where a
  particular question or comment should be posted  Please
  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh
  newsgroups before posting in any of them  Which questions appear
  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong
  where 
  
         To jump to a particular question search for
  sectionnumberquestionnumber enclosed in parentheses  For
  example to find Where can I FTP Macintosh software search for
  the string  21  To jump to a section instead of a question
  use a zero for  the question number


 WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE  12

      compsysmacfaq provides short answers to a number of 
  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup
  compsysmacmisc and compsysmacsystem  Four other files are
  worthy of particular note Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list
  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup
  compsysmacprogrammer  Its posted to that group weekly and 
  available for anonymous ftp from ftpcsuoregon 12822388 in 
  pubmac  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list 
  for compsysmaccomm available in that newsgroup and from
  rascalicsutexasedu in macfaq where the file youre reading now
  is also irregularly archived  This list answers many frequently
  asked questions about networking UNIX and the Mac
  telecommunications and foreign file formats  Norm Walsh has
  compiled an excellent FAQ for compfonts that answers a lot of
  questions about the various kinds of fonts and crossplatform
  conversion and printing  Its available in compfonts or by ftp
  from ibiscsumassedu in pubnormcompfontsFAQ  Finally Jim
  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for compunixaux covering Apples UNIX
  environment AUX  Its posted every 2 to 3 weeks in compunixaux
  and newsanswers Its available for anonymous ftp at
  jaguboxgsfcnasagov


 WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO  13
  
      There are no stupid questions but there are misplaced ones 
  You wouldnt ask your English teacher how to do the definite
  integral  of ln x between zero and one would you  So dont ask
  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft
  Word is in the background  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an
  excuse If you want people to help you you need to learn their
  ways of  communicating  
  
      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your
  mailbox with pearls of wisdom and maybe a few rotten oysters too
     Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering
  silence  For instance the most common and glaring mispost one
  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of
  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic asking a
  question about networking anywhere except compsysmaccomm
  normally produces no useful responses  Posting the same question
  to compsysmaccomm ensures that your post is read and considered
  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few
  network software designers
  
         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup  Do not crosspost 
  If a question isnt important enough for you to take the extra
  minute to figure out where it properly belongs its not important
  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading 
  For the same reason compsysmacmisc should not be used as a
  catchall newsgroup
  
         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in
  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs
  where  Specifically questions about productivity applications
  software you bought your Macintosh to run not software you bought
  to make your Macintosh run better should go to compsysmacapps
  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup 
  Communications programs games HyperCard compilers and databases
  all have more topical compsysmac newsgroups  Post questions
  about noncommunications hardware including questions about what
  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to
  compsysmachardware  Questions about MacOS system software
  belong in compsysmacsystem  Questions about utilities and
  extensions normally belong in compsysmacmisc  Questions about
  AUX go to compunixaux  Detailed questions about Appletalk
  belong in compprotocolsappletalk
  
         Direct questions about HyperCard to compsysmachypercard 
  NonHyperCard programming questions and questions about development
  environments should go to compsysmacprogrammer  ResEdit
  questions may be posted either to compsysmacmisc
  compsysmacsystem or compsysmacprogrammer but generally the
  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of compsysmacprogrammer
  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking 
  
         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY
  technical question about an application that actually begins to
  delve into the hows of a program as well as the whats Recent
  example How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly
  compare to other word processors written in high level languages
  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup
    
         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to
  compsysmacwanted and miscforsalecomputersmac ONLY  We
  understand that youre desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to
  get the  for a PowerBook 180 but trust me anyone who wants to
  buy it will be reading compsysmacwanted  Political and
  religious questions The Mac is better than Windows Is not Is
  too Is not Is too Hey How bout the Amiga What about it Is
  Not Is too belong in compsysmacadvocacy  Anything not
  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in compsysmacmisc
  
         Finally dont be so provincial as to consider only the
  compsysmac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions 
  Many questions about modems in compsysmaccomm are much more
  thoroughly discussed in compdcommodems  Questions about Mac MIDI
  are often better handled in compmusic even though its not a
  Macintosh specific newsgroup  Shop around  Usenets a big place
  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in
  compsysmac


 4 SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF
 THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM  SHOULDNT I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND
 WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE

      No  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as
  frequent questions  Unless you really have something new to add to
  the traditional answers such as the recent discovery that fonts in
  System 71 could eat memory private Email is a much better medium
  for answering common questions like this one
   
         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your Email
  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it
  before posting future questions  I do read all the newsgroups
  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that
  lets me send PWFAQs people with frequently asked questions the
  section of this document that answers their question with just the
  click of a button so please dont feel obligated to respond to
  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they
  cant be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it

    

  
 FTP  20 
 

 WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE  21

      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware
  freeware and demo software are sumexaimstanfordedu 364406
  macarchiveumichedu 14121116541 and wuarchivewustledu
  1282521354 which mirrors the other two sites and several
  others Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove
  them for space concerns and still has files that were deleted from
  the formerly important site rascalicsutexasedu  Rascal was
  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the
  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives  Unless
  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document
  should be available at the above sites
  
       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable Scandinavians 
  should try connecting to ftpfunetfi 1282146100 ftplthse
  130235203 or sicsse 1921612390 instead  Those in 
  the UK should look first at srcdocicacuk 14616921 
  Continental Europeans can try nicswitchch 13059140  
  ezinfoethzch 129132272 and anlanlfr192541791 
  Australian users should try to find what they want at archieau
  13913046 which mirrors infomac and macarchive  Japanese
  users will find sumex mirrored at ftputokyoacjp
  13069254254 

         A fourth very important site is ftpapplecom 1304323 
  This is Apples semiofficial repository for system software
  developer tools source code technical notes and other things
  that come more or less straight from Apples mouth  Some material
  at this site may not be distributed outside the US or by other
  sites that dont have an official license to distribute Apple
  system software  Please read the various README documents
  available at ftpapplecom for the detailed info if youre
  connecting from outside the US or if you wish to redistribute
  material you find here


 CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY EMAIL  22

      The infomac archives at sumexaim are available by Email from
  LISTSERVRICEVM1bitnet alternately listservricevm1riceedu 
  The listserver responds to the commands MACARCH HELP MACARCH
  INDEX and MACARCH GET filename  Mac archive files are available
  from macmacarchiveumichedu  Send it a message containing the
  words help and index no quotes on the first two lines of your
  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files
  you may request  You can retrieve files from other sites by using
  the server at ftpmaildecwrldeccom  For details send it a
  message with just the text help no quotes


 WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X  23

      If you cant find what youre looking for at one of the above
  sites try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it
  an Email message addressed to archie with the subject help 
  Archie servers are located at archierutgersedu 12861815
  America archiemcgillca 13220623 the original archie server
  in Canada archieau 13913046 Australia archiefunetfi
  1282146100 Scandinavia and archiedocicacuk 14616937
  the UK and the continent  These sites index the tens of
  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp  Login as archie
  no password is needed and type prog filename to find what
  youre looking for or type help for more detailed instructions 
  For instance you would type prog Disinfectant to search for a
  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant  If the initial search fails
  to turn up the file you want try variations on and substrings of
  the name  For instance if you didnt find Disinfectant with prog
  Disinfectant you might try prog disi instead  Substring
  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross  To avoid many
  erroneous matches add a hqx to the end of the substring eg
  prog disihqx  Most Mac software available on the net ends in
  hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does 

         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE
  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware  If you
  follow the above advice you should almost never have to ask the
  net where to find a particular piece of software


 CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X  24

      No  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from
  compbinariesmac that was corrupt or missed at your site  Please
  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about
  anonymous FTP archie and automatic Email servers


 WHAT IS BIN HQX CPT ETC  25

      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to
  more easily pass through foreign computer systems  First theyre
  compressed to make them faster to download and then theyre
  translated to either a binhex hqx or MacBinary bin format
  that other computers can digest  The Macintosh uses a special
  twofork filing system that chokes most other computers  BinHex
  files are 7bit ASCII text files while MacBinary files are pure
  8bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary
  protocol
  
         How a file has been translated and compressed for
  transmission is indicated by its suffix  Normally a file will have
  a name something like filenamexxxyyy  xxx indicates how it was
  compressed and yyy indicates how it was translated  To use a file
  youve FTPd and downloaded to your Mac youll need to reverse the
  process  Most files you get from the net require a twostep
  decoding process  First change the binhex hqx or MacBinary
  bin file to a doubleclickable Macintosh file then decompress
  it  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table
  below  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs
  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh
  files as they are downloaded

     A few notes on the decompressors

      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different
  compression schemes  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff
  all of them  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 30 StuffIt 151
  StuffIt Classic UnStuffIt and StuffIt Deluxe 20 and 10 will
  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 30 
  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt
  Expander 
    
         StuffIt 305 Lite and Deluxe consistently makes smaller
  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility  To allow
  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep
  netbandwidth down please compress all files you send to anonymous
  ftp sites with StuffIt 305
   
         UUTool MacCompress and SunTar handle the popular UNIX
  formats of  uuencode uu compress Z and tar tar
  respectively  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac
  products so use them instead when thats an  option  Translators
  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also
  available by anonymous ftp 
  
         Macutil is dik winters package of UNIX utilities to
  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading
  them to a Mac Since UNIX stores files differently than does the
  Mac macutil creates MacBinary bin files which should be
  automatically converted on download  It cant decompress
  everything In particular it cant decompress the new StuffIt 30
  archives   However if you need only one or two files out of an
  archivefor instance if you want to read the README to find out if
  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of
  itmacutil is indispensable  It can be found at sumexaim in the
  infomacunix directory

     A few notes on the compression formats

      bin  These are MacBinary files  Always use a binary file
  transfer protocol when transferring them never ASCII or text 
  Most files on the net are stored as hqx instead  Only rascal
  stores most of its files in bin format  Most communications
  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating
  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance
  theyll be downloading MacBinary files
  
      image This format is normally used only for system software
  so that online users can download files that can easily be
  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies  Instead of
  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies you can use Steve
  Christensens freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on
  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive 
  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy so you should have
  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case
  
      sea x X  sea files dont merit a position in the above
  table because theyre selfextracting  They may have been created
  with Compact Pro StuffIt or even DiskDoubler but all should be
  capable of decompressing themselves when doubleclicked  For some
  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard

 HOW CAN I GET BINHEX  STUFFIT  ETC  26

      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human
  being to copy them onto a floppy for you  If youre at a
  university theres absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to
  give you a copy and if youre anywhere less remote than McMurdo
  Sound chances are very good that someone at a computer center
  dealership or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt 
  Once you have StuffIt any version you dont need BinHex
    
         If youre such a computer geek that the thought of actually
  asking a living breathing human being instead of a computer 
  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of 
  protoplasmic jelly you can probably download a working copy  of
  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system 
  
         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any 
  means other than anonymous ftp then I suppose Ill mention that 
  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by 
  far the hardest way to get it  Ftp to wuarchivewustledu and 
  login  Type the word binary  Hit return  Type cd
  mirrorsrascalicsutexaseducompression and hit return  Then
  get StuffItExpander101SEAbin  and hit return  Of course
  its always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt
  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this
  fails look for something similar  If youve ftpd straight onto
  your Mac you should now have a selfextracting archive which will
  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when doubleclicked  If
  youve ftpd to your mainframe or UNIX account first you still
  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac  Just make
  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe
  is sending in binary mode  If you need more details on the last
  step consult the FAQ list for compsysmaccomm and the manuals
  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software
  
  
  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX STUFFIT ETC FROM A PC  27

       You cant  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable
  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac
  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp
  You MUST beg borrow or steal the necessary software such as
  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person  I realize this may 
  terrify those among you who havent left your parents basement 
  since you got an  Apple II in 1980 but eventually youre going 
  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother  
  though I suppose if youre this much of  a nerd you could send 
  your mother out to get it for you  While youre gathering
  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world 
  of daylight please dont bother the net by asking this question
  again  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh
  programs from a PC or other nonMacintosh computer onto a 
  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs




TROUBLESHOOTING WHAT TO DO BEFORE POSTING WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 30
 

         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific
  problems there are far more problems that arent covered here 
  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking
  for help  You should probably also perform the tenstep
  preventative maintenance routine described in section four
  especially rebuilding the desktop 43 and resizing the system
  heap 45  Following these steps may  or may not solve your
  problem but it will at least make it easier  for others to
  recommend solutions to you

 IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM  31

      Microsoft Word is crashing doesnt say much  What were you
  doing when it crashed  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the
  crash  The more information you provide about the actions
  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you 
  The more precisely youve identified the problem and the actions
  preceding it Step 1 the easier it will be to tell if the
  following steps fix the problem  For example Sometimes
  QuarkXPress 30 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error is
  not nearly as helpful as QuarkXPress 30 crashes when I link two
  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already
  contain text  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug
  remains after a given step  The latter lets you go right to the
  problem and see if its still there or not


 READ THE READ ME FILE  32

      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and
  bugs in their READ ME files  Often these arent documented in the
  manual Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound
  familiar


 CHECK FOR VIRUSES  33

      Run Disinfectant or another antiviral across your disk  Virus
  infections are rarer than most people think but they do occur and
  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do


 REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES  34  
   
       For half a dozen reasons external magnetic fields
  improperly written software the alignment of the planets a file
  on a disk may not contain the data its supposed to contain  This
  can cause all types of unexplained unusual behavior  Restoring
  from original masters will normally fix this


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  35  

      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file
  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous 
  See question 46 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean
  reinstall 
  
         If the problem continues to occur after youve taken these
  steps chances are youve found either a conflict between your
  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the
  program  So its time to


 ISOLATE THE PROBLEM  36  
 
         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem
  will assert itself  Here are the basic steps of isolating the
  cause of a system or application crash
  
     a	Run only one application at a time Occasionally applications do
     conflict with each other  If the problem does not manifest itself
     without other applications running simultaneously you can begin
     launching other applications until you find the one that causes 
     the crash
     
     b	If youre running System 6 turn off MultiFinder  If youre
     running System 7 allot as much memory to the application as you 
     can afford  Sometimes programs just need more memory especially 
     when performing complicated operations
     
     c If youre running System 7 turn off virtual memory and 32bit
     addressing  Theres still an awful lot of System 7 hostile
     software out there including some from companies that really 
     have no excuse  Can you say Microsoft Word 51 boys and girls  
     I knew you could  Some of this software only expresses its 
     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken
     
     d	Boot from a virgin system floppy  If the problem disappears
     you likely have an init conflict  You need to progressively remove
     extensions until the problem vanishes  Use a little common sense
     when choosing the first extensions to remove  If the problem occurs
     when you try to open a file remove any inits that mess with the
     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first  If the
     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated
     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or if you have
     a lot of them perform a binary search by removing half of the
     extensions at a time  Once the problem disappears add half of the
     most recently removed set back  Continue until youve narrowed the
     conflict down to one extension  When you think youve found the
     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make 
     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem


 CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT  37

      By now you should have a very good idea of when where and why
  the conflict occurs  If a tech support number is available for the
  software call it  If youre lucky the company will have a work
  around or fix available  If not perhaps theyll at least add the
  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release

    

  
 PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  40
 

      You wouldnt drive your car 100000 miles without giving it a
  tuneup  A computer is no different  Regular tuneups avoid a lot
  of problems  Although there are Mac mechanics wholl be happy to
  charge you 75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change theres
  no reason you cant change it yourself  The following ninestep
  program should be performed about every three months 


 TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  41

      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more
  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a
  little time cleaning up your hard disk  If youre at all like me
  youll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for
  applications you no longer have archives of software youve
  dearchived shareware you tried out and didnt like announcements
  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no
  longer need  If youre running System 7 you may also have several
  more megabytes in your trash can alone  Throw them away and empty 
  the trash


 RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  42

      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain 
  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension 
  in your collection  If you dont use the functionality of an
  extension at least every fifth time you boot up youre probably
  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes
  up memory destabilizes your system and slows down every startup 
  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month theres no
  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time  Cutting back on your
  extension habit can really help avoid crashes 


 REBUILD THE DESKTOP  43

      The Desktop filedatabase holds all the information necessary
  to associate each file with the application that created it  It
  lets the system know what application should be launched when you
  open a given file and what icons it should display where 
  Depending on its size each application has one or more
  representatives in the desktop file  As applications and files
  move on and off your hard disk the Desktop file can be become
  bloated and corrupt  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac 
  Every so often its necessary to throw the bums out and start with
  a clean slate  Fortunately its easier to rebuild the desktop than
  to defeat an incumbent 
  
         One warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments
  youve stored in the Get Info boxes  Under System 7 Maurice
  Volaskis freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments
  across a rebuild  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only 
  if Apples Desktop Manager extension is also installed 
  
         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and as your
  extensions finish loading depress the Command and Option keys 
  Youll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild
  the desktop and warning you that This could take a few minutes 
  Click OK It will take more than a few minutes The more files you
  have the longer it will take  If youre running System 6 you may
  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop
   
          If youre experiencing definite problems and not just doing
  preventive maintenance you may want to use Fifth Generations
  freeware init Desktop Reset  Desktop Reset completely deletes the
  Desktop file before rebuilding it thus eliminating possibly
  corrupt data structures    


 ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  44

      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950
  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain
  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk
  such as which disk to boot from  Unfortunately this parameter
  RAM can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes  To reset
  it under System 7 hold down the Command Option P and R keys
  while restarting your Mac  Under System 6 hold down the Command
  Option and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the
  Apple menu Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter
  RAM  Since youve erased almost all the settings in the General
  Control Panel you should now reset them to whatever you want
   
         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the 
  date and time but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is
  notoriously inaccurate youll probably want to take this
  opportunity to reset it anyway


 RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  45 

      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most
  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the
  bottom of their screen every time they restart  All these
  extensions and most applications too need space in a section of
  memory called the System Heap  If the System Heap isnt big enough
  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of
  it they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap
  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and
  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off  All this
  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance
  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac
  
         If youre using System 7 your Macintosh will automatically
  resize the system heap as necessary but if youre running System 6
  its important to set your system heap size large enough to manage
  all your extensions and applications  By default this size is set
  to 128K way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all 
  The system heap size is stored in the normally noneditable boot
  blocks of every system disk  Bill Steinbergs freeware utility
  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks
  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much
  needs to be allocated  If youre running System 6 get BootMan
  use it and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  46

      System files can become corrupt and fragmented especially if
  youve stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them 
  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file
  corruption  I recommend doing a clean reinstall  Heres how

    1  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks  
    2  Copy any nonstandard fonts and desk accessories out 
        of your System file into a temporary suitcase
    3  Trash the System file on your hard disk  Also trash the 
        Finder MultiFinder DA Handler and all other standard Apple 
        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser  These will all be 
        replaced in the new installation  If youre running or 
        installing System 7 move everything in the Extensions 
        Control Panels and Preferences folders into the top level 
        of the System Folder
    4  Rename the System Folder  Any name other than System Folder 
        is  fine
    5  Doubleclick the installer script on your System disk  Then 
        choose Customize  Select the appropriate software for your 
        model Mac and printer  You could do an Easy Install instead 
        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you dont 
        need that waste your memory and disk space
    6  Once installation is finished move everything from the 
        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System 
        folder  If youre asked if you want to replace anything you 
        forgot to take something out in step 3  Youll need to replace 
        things individually until you find the duplicate piece 
    7  Reinstall any fonts or DAs you removed in step 2
    8  Reboot  You should now have a clean defragmented System file 
        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable 
        system overall


     DISK UTILITIES  47

      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that
  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even
  causing data loss  Apple includes Disk First Aid a simple utility
  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems with its System
  disks Its also available for anonymous ftp from ftpapplecom in
  the  directory dtsmacsyssofthdsc  Even if you have an earlier 
  version you should get the latest version 71 from ftpapplecom
  and run it on all your hard disks
     
         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that
  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid
  though interestingly none of them detect and repair everything
  that Disk First Aid does  The three most effective for general
  work are Central Points MacTools Deluxe 20 Fifth Generations
  Public Utilites and Symantecs Norton Utilities for the Macintosh
  20  A department or work group should have all of these as well
  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do 
  For individuals MacTools 48 street is about half the price of
  Norton 94 street or Public Utilities 98 street so features
  and ease of use being roughly equal I recommend MacTools
   
         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they
  cant fix  When that happens its time to backup 47 and
  reformat 49


     BACKING UP  48

      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be
  done a LOT more often than every three months  The simplest back
  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies
  or other removable media  If you keep your data files separate
  from your application and support files then its easy to only back
  up those folders which change frequently  Nonetheless every three
  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk 
  
         A number of programs are available to make backing up
  easier  Apple included a very basic full backup application with
  System 6  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup
  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder
  onto floppies  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the
  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 20 include more powerful floppy backup
  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups
  
         Finally if youre lucky enough to have a Tape Drive network
  server or removable media device to use for backups you should
  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux 49 street
  doesnt support tape drives and Diskfit Pro 74 street  There
  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD
  Backup from System 6  


 DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  49

      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free
  space in the same place to write large files  Therefore the
  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be
  stored in different places on your hard disk  As files become more
  and more fragmented performance can degrade  There are several
  ways to defragment a hard disk
  
         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your
  files erase the hard disk and you might as well reformat while
  youre at it  See question 410 and restore all the files
   
         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for
  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place ie
  without erasing it  Although the ads for all these products brag
  about their safety once youve bought the software and opened the
  shrinkwrap they all warn you to back up your disk before
  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong  There are NO
  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please dont annoy the
  net by asking for one 


 REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  410

      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use so a
  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data  You dont
  need to reformat every three months but when your system is
  crashing no matter what you try reformatting is the ultimate means
  of wiping the slate clean  Reformatting your hard disk may even
  gain you a few extra megabytes of space  Not all hard disks are
  created equal  Some can hold more data than others  To facilitate
  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks  813
  megabytes is the average formatted capacity  Your mileage may
  vary  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator
  of drive capacity  When you reformat theres no reason at all not
  to reclaim whatever unused space Apples left on your disk
     
         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to
  initialize them Most hard disks come with formatting software 
  Apples disks and System software ship with HD SC setup a minimal
  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY 
  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with
  their hard drives  Normally this will be all you need to reformat
  your hard disk
  
         A number of generalpurpose formatters are also available
  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like
  encryption password protection multiple partitioning faster disk
  access System 7 compatibility and even compression  Two of the
  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition
  49 street for either  While there are one or two freeware
  formatters available none are likely to be superior to the ones
  bundled with your hard disk 
  
         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and
  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter
  what software they use  Otherwise disk corruption crashes and
  data losses are a very good possibility
