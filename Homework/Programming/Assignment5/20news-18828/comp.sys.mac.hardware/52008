Subject Re Cache card for IIsi


In a previous article glalondewatsonibmcom  says


As of last week Macs Place had the Applied Engineering QuickSilver card
32k cache one PDS slot socket for FPU on sale for 9900 without FPU
Regular price is 199

No idea if this is still going on but I can get the phone no if anyone is
interested I found their ad in MacUser


Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards I have only one report which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1 speedup Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache cardand get a miss thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth 0 I dont know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via softwareread about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftpapplecom

So is 99 a good deal or not I still dont know
I would say that is not a good deal  In Junes MacWorld River
formerly Maya computer advertised a DayStar 33 MHz PowerCache WITH
68882 for 295  Can you believe it  I know prices would be falling
but geeze

Thought you might be interested
