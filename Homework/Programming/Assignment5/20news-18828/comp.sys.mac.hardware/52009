Subject Virus Centris 610 wierdness

	Ive been getting seemingly random disk accesses on my Centris 610
with a Quantum 240 LPS but this is NOT the regular recalibration it has been
doing since I got it  This is sometimes short sometimes long accesses
that sound like there is some readwriting going on
	I have SAM 35 and Disinfectant 30 but neither picks up anything
Any ideas
