Why no It is a little known fact that NO macs have a CPU They are all

Silly you Dont you know the only division at Apple allowed to use the
Cray is the legal department

Um theyve sold the Cray They realised that spending two years on
numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex
injectionmolded cases was not the way to go and was holding up
development work
Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery
cover and it had to be redone Thats why the portable was about three
years late

Designing metal cases is easier  theyre managing with the Calculator DA
now it can compute 45100045 correctly

Any other suggestions
