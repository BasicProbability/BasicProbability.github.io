I have a PB 100 that I might be selling soon to upgrade to a Duo before
graduation to take advantage of the educational discount  To those who
have recently bought or sold a PB 100 what kind of price did you get
Info on any config of PB100 appreciated  Thanks

Several months ago I bought a 440 PB100 with external floppy AppleTalk
Remote Access a Kensington case and AC adapter with complete documentation
and in almost new condition used for US900 I considered it a very good
buy and am very cosy with my little baby now

Put me down for a PB100 420 with ext floppy AppleTalk Remote Acces
AC adapter and fresh out of box was used but buyer switched to 140
on arrival and sold unopened box Purchased last October for 925
Later I bought a used PowerPort V32 9600 bps internal faxmodem for
something like 225 Im using right now Works great  

No real complaints I love my portable system got a color home setup
also Mac II Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other
simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours or
overnight to run tying up my Mac II I got the PB100 with fast modem
to do light work and ontherun stuff I figured Id give it to my
little sister next year when she goes to college Its running System
71 now without any problems Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal
emulations with MATLAB on our universitys VAXVMS nice thing that it
benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx
So the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation not
too hard at all for it It was a FABULOUS setup     Weeee

By the Way all MATLAB software was on class accounts I was also the
TA for a class that used SIMULABSIMULINK We had sitelicense and
takehome thendestroy later siterelease licenses No pirating
there incase youre wondering Great Program 

Just like to add whatever future system you get you can almost never
get enuff memory Buy it while its cheap  that is buy it when you
get the computer since its usually cheaper than upgrading I ALWAYS
run out of disk space But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi so I
never worried about space before Got several carts
