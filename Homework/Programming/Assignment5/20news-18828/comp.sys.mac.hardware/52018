Subject Whats needed for CD ROM on a mac


Does System 7X support all SCSI CD ROM drives  Or are specific drivers
needed for each different makemodel

Specifically Im looking at getting a NEC CDR25 mainly because they
are cheap  I know its a slow drive but multimedia isnt my interest
I mainly want it for extracting software distributed on CD
Will I need to get a specific driver to use this drive on a Mac


thanksCharles
