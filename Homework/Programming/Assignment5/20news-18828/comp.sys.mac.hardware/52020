 Even better than that  how does a 68000based Amiga 2000 perform in
 daily tasks compared to my 68030based IIci

 Answer except in a very few cases I get my butt kicked by the Amiga
 Sure there are other considerations but it goes to show you how
 proper design from the beginning in hardware and software can give
 you great returns  as well as showing you that if you dont have a
 marketing department to speak of no one will care how good your system is

Ive had the same experience actually I love the Mac interface and any number
of the features but am sorely dissapointed with the speed I use macs daily
and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department Im familiar with almost
every model out there and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari
ST simply blow the Mac out of the water in terms of performance At this time
I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the
advantages of the Amiga or the ST and Falcon but I really wish Apple would
get their heads together on speed  They could take a real lesson in
mulitasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too 

  Im still happy with my ci but I dont understand why the performance is
 so bad comparatively  They could have done multitasking properly
 They could have done everthing else better  but apple didnt
 of course DOS 6 and windows 31 are nothin to write home about either

I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does everything well
someday If I had my choice I would go with Mac in most aspects but add the
speed and superior MultiTasking of the other platforms

As for the original topic Trying to compare just the chip in a machine seems
almost worthless A fast 386 with a wizbang graphics accelerator will be
faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra Add a
graphics accelerator to a 486 and you really fly Of course add one the the
Quadra and then youre blowing the 486 away etc

 Oh well yall got 200 worth for the price of 002

I think mine was only worth 001
