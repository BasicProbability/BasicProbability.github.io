Subject    Mac II vi to be discontinued Good buy

A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi
session compatible CDROM drives for what seems like an attractive price
1500 Ive used many other models up to a II ci but this would be the
first I could have my own Mac Is it safe to buy an abouttobe discontinued
model such as this Id like to yank the CDROM drive out put it in a
housing and share it with my PC Is this feasible The only info I have on
the II vi is that it is relatively slow 16MHz has an 68030 chip with a
math coprocessor I want to add a nonApple portrait monitor and use this
machine for HyperCard stack design Is this a good buy or would I be
wasting my money I would appreciate some advice Thanks
