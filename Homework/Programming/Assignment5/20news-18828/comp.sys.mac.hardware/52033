Subject PhoneNet questions

My school is settinÿûg up a new network with bothe Macs and Apple IIs  Im
used to ethernet and dont know muÿch about LocalTalk  Two things  first
in MacWherehouse btheÿy have PowerUser network connectors and the caption
leads you to belÿûieve that you can plug them into the phone lines in the
building and have them work  Is this true  Ive seen it done by running
sepÿerate phone cords but never with real lines  Second if that does work
could you use a modem ÿhooked up to that same line while the network was
active  Help would be greatly appriciated  BTWÿ’running seperate phone line 
is out of the question the network wil  VERRY spread o
