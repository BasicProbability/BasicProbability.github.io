   So I finally decided to risk this upgrade FAQ in hand Ive gathered
the
 pieces together  The only problem is that I havent been able to find
 anyone whos even heard of thermal tapeglue which is what the FAQ
 recommends for attaching the heat sink  I am just tempted to use duct
 tape here anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
 the processor  much thanks

Just use a thin film of epoxy  Thats what I did  Epoxy conducts heat
fairly well  And my heat sink gets warm to prove it  I looked for the
stuff myself  my local EE jocks said to use epoxy

Have fun

Ken
