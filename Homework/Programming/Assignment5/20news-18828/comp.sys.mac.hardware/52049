NSI have is a C650 880 with mouse for 2295 does anyone know of a better
NSdeal

I dont know of a better deal but would you be willing to share your
deal with the rest of us That certainly sounds like youre getting a
great deal Id be interested in that deal too

  DeLuxe 126b 956s  MicroFrame The BEST in Price and Performance
  QNet3  The PipeLine  Atlanta GA  Echo Mail From Around The World
                                                                                                                               
OK if I post where this comes from will people stop sending email 
asking where I negotiated the deal 

The deal is from International Computer and Networking in CA
I saw the ad int he back of MacWorld and MacUser
phone number is 3104419181 and the deal may have changed since
a few weeks ago since they change prices about every ten minutes 

Alas this is a funny system it SOUNDS like a good deal but this is a 
Centris 650 4MB on the motherboard 4MB SIMM 80MB HD NO ETHERNET
and NO COPROCESSOR well actually its a 68LC040 instead of a 68RC040
just had to say that to keep people from saying there is no such thing
as an 040 without a coprocessor since the FPU is built into the chip

OK there ya have it but if I were you I would wait untill the cyclones
come out and buy a Quadra 800
