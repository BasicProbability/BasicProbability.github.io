Subject Quicktime resolution

Anyone happen to know what the max resolution for quicktime is  Im 
trying to determine if a maxed out system using quicktime could produce
and edit broadcast quality video including bringing the video in via
video spigotetc  So far I have yet to see anything thats even close
to SVHS in quicktime but itd be great to hear that its possible

Thanks for the help
