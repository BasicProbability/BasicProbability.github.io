One way to tell is to
go and open the PowerBook control panel71  There is a setting
there that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac  If it
is present when you open the control panel then you can assume that
SetWUTime will work  

Gee nice of them to tell us  Like how about a Gestalt response bit for
the
GestaltPowerManagerAttributesFoodSpreadProduct selector  Well at least
now I know why it doesnt work I assume I m using a PB 145
