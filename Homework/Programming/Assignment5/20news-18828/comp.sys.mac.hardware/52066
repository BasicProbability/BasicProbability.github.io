 The Lisa was originally introduced in 1980 or 81 I forget now and
 sold for 9995 with 2 400k floppy drives and 1Mb memory It didnt do
 too well grin

Close but no cigar  The LISA was introduced in January 1983 at the
same time as the Apple e  Ill have to check to see if the Hard
Drive came bundled for the 10K  The floppy drives were 525
initially the infamous twiggy drives
