Subject The 25MHz IIsi


  So I finally decided to risk this upgrade FAQ in hand Ive gathered the
pieces together  The only problem is that I havent been able to find
anyone whos even heard of thermal tapeglue which is what the FAQ
recommends for attaching the heat sink  I am just tempted to use duct
tape here anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
the processor  much thanks
