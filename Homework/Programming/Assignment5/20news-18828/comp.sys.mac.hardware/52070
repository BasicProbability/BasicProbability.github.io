 LLLLLL         Board  Vision     
                          
 

 I know of several NuBus framegrabber boards but wonder if there
 might be similar ones for the lesser Macs those without slots
 something permitting instant freezing of a video picture PAL 
 and feeding it in without jaggies to a simple digitizer like 
 MacVision which takes 22 secs to scan a picture so a frame
 grabber is a necessity 

 The objective is 512342 1bit pixel BW pictures stored in
 HyperCard have tried using topquality VCR with freezeframe
 function but the screens come out full of streaks and garbage

    PLEASE reply ONLY to  ianfrandomse
      and Ill summarize
      to the net cannot
   read such highvolume
    group as is csmh             Thanks
