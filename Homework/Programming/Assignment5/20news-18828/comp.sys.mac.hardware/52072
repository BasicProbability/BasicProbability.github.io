Subject Re Monitors  should they be kept on 24 hours a day


 Yes I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about
 monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldnt I keep them on
 24 hours a day Any advice Thanks Take carePaul

There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement  True
there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage but
the internal power supply is wellprotected Ive turned my Mac on and off 
six or seven times a day for three years without problem  The monitor is
the same  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity  twice as much
as a television possibly more

Turn it off when youre not using it  Itll save you money and the world
a few more resources
