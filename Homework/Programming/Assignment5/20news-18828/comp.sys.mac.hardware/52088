Subject nonApple Mon for Duos

The Duos can drive Apples 16 monitor at 832x624 resolution and
256 colors I think What nonApple 1617 monitors can also be
used Would a multisync NEC5FG work as well at the same resolution
What are the outstanding points of the Apple monitor when compared
with these other monitors
