Subject LW Select 310 doesnt work out of box

Hello NetPeople

We have a LaserWriter Select 310 standard 15Mb RAM connected to an LC
III 480

The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type 1 fonts or any TrueType fonts
in the System

The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct
but this 310 printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out
of the box

IMHO an Apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event

The installer disks for the printer install LW Select 310 driver v 10
PrintMonitor v 71 and backgrounder v 31  on a System 71 LC III

Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printerconfiguration
because we really need some help on this one

Thanks
Anthony    anthonymedicineadelaideeduau
