Subject Trade an SE for a color Mac


Ok I want to get a color Mac I dont care if it is an LC or a Mac II or
what but I want to go to a color machine  Id prefer to trade my
present Mac SE system plus some cash or other equipment for the color
system as right now Im not full of the  to buy a color system
outright
Heres what my Mac SE system has

Mac SE 420 with internal 800K drive
20 Meg external
External 800K drive
ImageWriter II with 4 color ribbon

Stuff that can go with it
Im willing to include both of the 9600 modems and the 2400 baud modem
if the deal is right  Keep in mind that both the 9600 modems are less
than a month old and the MultiTech modem sells for about 440 or so

MultiTech Multimodem II 9600 datafax
US Robotics Sportster 9600 data
Microcom QX12K         normally will connect at only 2400 as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom

The USR and the MultiTech are both brandnew
