Subject Re When is Apple going to ship CD300is

In article 1quod6i3nmenudouhedu ln63sdmsdcc4ucsdedu writes

The CD300 external is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile
now  Demand for the units are high so they are pretty rare  Ive seen them  
listed for around 525550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac  
reseller  Ive also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CDs

I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external
drive  I did call Apple Catalog as recommended and they told me the drives
were back ordered until May 8  I placed an order anyways and two days later
I had a visit from Federal Express  Well you can guess how I spent my weekend
Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange
when you order from the Apple Catalog  You may want to check if they have any
internal drives

BTW an older version of GateKeeper I dont recall which version hung up my
Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk  I got the newer version
which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4xx CD driver
