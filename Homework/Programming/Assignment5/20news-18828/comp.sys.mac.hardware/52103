Subject Quadra clock chip  followup

My recently modified Quadra 700 with a socket for clock oscillators has now
completed nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz with a 64 mhz
clock oscillator I have also tried a 55 mhz CMOS clock and that works as well
On the more stupid side Ive discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make
your Q700 as slow as a Centris 610 However a 25 mhz clock which would have
yielded a 125 mhz Quadra 700 Whod want one didnt work at all

Impatiently awaiting a 66 mhz clock
