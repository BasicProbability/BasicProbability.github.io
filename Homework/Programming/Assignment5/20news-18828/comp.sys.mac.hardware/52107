How do I get a subscription to MacWeek  I want one but I dont seem to be able
to find a subscription card anywhere
 
email smashmanlelandstanfordedu

I just ordered my subscription today  Call MacWeeks Customer Service
Dept at 609 4612100 and quote some plastic  If you forget the number
its included in the statement of ownership which is on the contents 
page of the copy I have  A one year subscription costs 9900 in the US
Canada or Mexico  I was told my first issue would arrive in 46 weeks
