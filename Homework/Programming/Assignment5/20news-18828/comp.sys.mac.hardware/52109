Subject Sony DAT  Retrospect 13Ci Problems

Hi
Im having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work  Im using
Retrospect 13Ci
and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci
which has
now unfortunately gone to another department
  Ideally we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup  I cant seem to
get the
Retrospect software to recognize the media at all  When in the Devices
dialog
it can see the DAT device but comes up with firstly Running secondly
Media Failure and then immediately Contents Unknown  This does not
happen with the
Mac IIci setup which simply says Ready
  Im hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
solution I 
know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra
but they have
a Mac IIci which they can use
  
THE SYMPTOMS
System software is 71 also didnt
work with 701
  I have tried the following
  Turn off all extensions except Retrospect SCSI required
  Tested on a variety of machines  Quadra IIsi and LC at least
  Connected no other SCSI devices
  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc
  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one Yes  we got that desperate
  Read the Retrospect manual EVEN MORE DESPERATE 

Replies via email would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance 
Ill post any
solutions to this group

Cheers
Matt
