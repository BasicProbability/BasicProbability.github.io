The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem it was heavily
discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadras at least the
700
and 900  System 71 should not have that problem for most people the 
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor  In my
case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
Quadra
700 all that occured early last year

Anyone know if there is an updated driver for Sony DAT drives  I cant
get mine to work with our 950 see Sony DAT  Retrospect Problems
posted in this group but Im also having problems with other new macs

Cheers Matt
