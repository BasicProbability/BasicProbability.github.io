Subject Upgrading PB100

I read in a recent Tidbits1712 about the possibility of putting
a 68030 in a PB100 I am interested in doing so but would like
to know more about it Does it involve just replacing the 68000 that
is on the daughterboard or does it involve getting a new daughter
board Also would the 68030 be able to run QT with the PB100s
screennot pretty I know but possible And of course what would
the damage be  Any info would be appreciated
Thanks in advance Jay Fogel
