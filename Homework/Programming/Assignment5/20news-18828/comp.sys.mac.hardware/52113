Subject Re Quadra clock chip  followup



I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours I have also tried a 70 MHz osz but after 12 hour my Quadra 700 died I am not sure what was the reason for that
but it is to risky to run it to fast Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems 

But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again So once again do a backup befor you start

Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz

Very interesting are the graphics results Graphics 30052 couldnt belief this but it is true Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isnt garantied to run Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink I would say NO After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra so I didnt see any problems The room temperatur was 22 Celsius 72 F If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F 45 C and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side


Hope you will have the same success than I had
