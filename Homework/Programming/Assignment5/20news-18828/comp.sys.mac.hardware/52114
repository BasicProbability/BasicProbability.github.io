   anybody know the difference between the Quarda 900 and Quadra 950
   Quarda 900 is a popular misspelling of Quadra 900 which has a 25 MHz
   040 processor The 950 has a 33 MHz 040 and some local buses on the
   motherboard run faster The video is different also The 950 can run a
   13 and I believe a 16 monitor in 16 bit color without a VRAM upgrade
   

Besides the faster processor the 950 has SCSI 2 and as far as I know faster
IO due to separate processors handling those functions The 950 can output 16
bit video to a 16 monitor with 1 meg of VRAM and 24 bit with 2 meg

hope this helps
