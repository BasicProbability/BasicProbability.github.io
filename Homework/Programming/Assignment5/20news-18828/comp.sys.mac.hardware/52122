There seems to be some confusion about educational discounts  True Apple
has different dealer price for educational and retail vendors but those
price differences are not that great about 5

Maybe but the end user price is more like 10  20  less  It is here in 
Canada anyway

	For what its worth my experience has been that the educational
discount which my SO has taken advantage of as a teacher is roughly
equivalent to the corporate discounts that Im able to get as an employee of
a fairly large multistate corporation which is usually at least as good as
what one can get at one of the discount computer chains eg CompUSA
	For purposes of budget estimation around here we usually just knock
around 20 off SRP
