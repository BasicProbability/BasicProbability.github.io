Subject Internalizing Removable Drive

Is it possible to rip an external SyQuest removable drive out of its
external casing and install it into the 5 14 empty bay slot on a
Centris 650 I know a special bracket would need to be purchased but
is there any power hookupSCSI constraints that would prevent it If
anyone has done it could they mail me some instructions It doesnt
seem to be that overwhelming an undertaking
