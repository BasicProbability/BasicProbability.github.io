Subject Re Monitors  should they be kept on 24 hours a day
From stubbshawkcsukansedu Jerry Stubbs


Yes I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about
monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldnt I keep them on
24 hours a day Any advice Thanks Take carePaul


I vote for turning them off at night  THe stress of offon is a little 
harmful so dont turn it off then back on an hour later etc but
turning them off for 45 hours or overnight is a good idea

The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight along
with heat 

We have a lot of 10year old machines in the basement that still work but
who cares they are off 24 hours a day
