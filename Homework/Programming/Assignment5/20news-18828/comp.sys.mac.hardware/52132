Subject RE Good HardDisk driver for nonApple drives Sys 71 compat

I need to add to your message
I have a major problem on my hands  I have a Rodime 60 series
RO3000T external hard drive  Rodime is out of business 
and not writing any more drivers  In particular drivers 
compatable with system 71  After talking to Rodime 
they recommended the following Hard drive manufacturers 
and their driver software that were compatable
 
SCSI Hard drive manufacturer            Driver Software
            
FWB                                     Hard disk tool kit
FWB                                     Hard disk tool kit  personal
La Cie                                  Silverlining 52 or higher
Casa Blanca Driver Software             Drive7
 
If anybody has experience with these driver software packages please reply
If there is shareware out there I would like to get my hands on it  I would
much rather send a good developer the 25 or so because most of the software
I mentioned if purchased would cost 125 49 149 and 49 respectively

Thanks in advance
