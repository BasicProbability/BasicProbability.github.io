Subject Re Quadra clock chip  followup

I have also moved on to a 666 mhz clock Thus far not problems Im not totallysurprised as Ive had Q700 run at 354 mhz CPU clock speed using a VSO My
25 mhz rated Daystar QuadraCache got very hot at 32 mhz and would fail previously I glued on a piece of aluminum stock to the hi speed RAM chips and it runs
cool without problems at 333 mhz The combination is faster than a Q950
