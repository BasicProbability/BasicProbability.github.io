Subject 72pin SIMMS for Q800 be careful before buying

I purchased 2x8 MB 72pin 60 ns SIMMs for my Quadra 800 from Chip
Merchant Ive been very satisfied with them in the past  Either one
alone works but both together fail  I called Apple for advice and was
told that there was a problem with Composite SIMMs  Only noncomposite
SIMMs should be used with the Q800  Chip Merchant confirmed that they
presently sell only composite 72pin SIMMs  So Q800 SIMMs need to be
both 60 ns and noncomposite
