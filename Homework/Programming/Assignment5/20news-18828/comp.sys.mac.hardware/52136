Well I dont exaclty know what should be done but what I do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use  I do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though  Turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less RAM than
a screen saver but it requires more of MY memory to remember to turn
it off pretty easy to remember to turn it on though
