Subject Third party monitor on IIsi

So whats the deal with the PDS slot in the IIsi

I recently purchased a Mac IIsi  I want to add a nonApple monitor to the
system  I was told that you could buy a 90 degree angled PDS to NuBus adaptor
card so you can fit a standard NuBus card into the computer

Am I mistaken or do have to buy a PDS monitor card specifically for the IIsi
Ive seen the PDS monitor cards for the si but they seem expensive and Im
not exactly made of money

Any ideas  Help  Clue me in
