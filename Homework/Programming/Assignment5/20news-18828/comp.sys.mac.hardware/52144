Alas this is a funny system it SOUNDS like a good deal but this is a 
Centris 650 4MB on the motherboard 4MB SIMM 80MB HD NO ETHERNET
and NO COPROCESSOR well actually its a 68LC040 instead of a 68RC040
just had to say that to keep people from saying there is no such thing
as an 040 without a coprocessor since the FPU is built into the chip

    Actually there such a thing as an 040 without a coprocessor Its
called the 68LC040 This is a redesign of the full 040 which people are
calling the 68RC040 although I have been told by a number of people
that Motorola doesnt call the full 040 that without the integrated
FPU hardware It just isnt there


Thats what the pseudodisclaimer is supposed to say sorry for the confusion
