Anyone have a price quotevendor for the vx to centris 650 upgrade
Ive been quoted a price of 2401 till August 15th after which it will
cost 2732  This of course doesnt include the tradein rebate of
1300 for the vx board  Thus for 1101 one gets a Centris 650 8 meg
onboard with both the FPU and Ethernet  Anyone else have any info
This price is from the University of Illinois microorder center are
there any other vendors who offer similar prices

    Falcon Microsystems of Landover MD the sole Appleauthorized
reseller to the federal government has similar open market prices
The upgrade is too new to be on General Services Adminsitration schedule
yet
