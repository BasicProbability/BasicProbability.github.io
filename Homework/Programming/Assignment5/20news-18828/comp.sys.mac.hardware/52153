Subject Q Way to connect PB 145 IIsi P LW LS

Is there a way to connect a PowerBook 145 Mac IIsi and Personal LaserWriter
LS so that I can not necessarily silmultaneoulsy print from either the IIsi
or PB and file share between the IIsi and PB
I know I can get the expensive LW NT upgrade for my LS but I cant afford
that
 
Thanks Mark
