Subject Re 72pin SIMMS for Q800 be careful before buying

 I purchased 2x8 MB 72pin 60 ns SIMMs for my Quadra 800 from Chip
 Merchant Ive been very satisfied with them in the past  Either one
 alone works but both together fail  I called Apple for advice and was
 told that there was a problem with Composite SIMMs  Only noncomposite
 SIMMs should be used with the Q800  Chip Merchant confirmed that they
 presently sell only composite 72pin SIMMs  So Q800 SIMMs need to be
 both 60 ns and noncomposite

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs although many most 16 MB 
SIMMs are  72pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM thus permitting 
the use of 4 Mb DRAM devices the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs to be used 
for two 4 MB banks on one SIMM  I cant imagine that it would be cheaper 
to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached and 
exceeded bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago  
Its probably possible to build a singlebank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts  
this could cause problems in a Q800  Im not sure why youd want to do 
this though as a dualbank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a 
singlebank composite one
