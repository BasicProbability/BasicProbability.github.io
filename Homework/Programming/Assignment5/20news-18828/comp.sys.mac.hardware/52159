 Yes I know computers and harddisk drives should be ALWAYS on But what about
 monitors They generate a lots of heat Should I or shouldnt I keep them on
 24 hours a day Any advice Thanks Take carePaul
 
 There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement  True
 there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage but
 the internal power supply is wellprotected Ive turned my Mac on and off 
 six or seven times a day for three years without problem  The monitor is
 the same  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity  twice as much
 as a television possibly more

	The computer itself uses far less electricity than a TV 
Monitordepends on the size 

	But one thing NOT to do is use a selfshutdown or powershutdown 
ironappliance on the same electric line

	After a new monitor and power supply and modem my wife still doesnt
think her iron is at fault 	She should know better being a Biomed
