Subject Really stupid monitor question

I have a IIsi  a portrait display and I love it  Im using the
builtin video support so its slow and deals with 16 colorsgrays
So Im wondering  if I get a video card how much does this tend to
speed up things and will I be able to get more than 4bits  Oh I have
CombiCache wFPU  Does this limit my choices of video cards

Thanks

Peace
