What is the real story here Can I hook up any PC SVGA Montitor to the
Centris internal video Do I need to make my own cable if it doesnt not
come with one Has apple released a Tech note with the pinouts for doing
such The reasoj I ask is that it seems the prices for SVGA are lower
than
that of their mac counterparts

First of all I wouldnt advise wasting your time with Apple  Theyll
treat you like an idiot and you wont get any answers a personal
opinion

The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitors scanning rates with
Apples rates  I dont know Apples video scanning rates but I use the
Micron Xceed 30s rates as theyre a good approximation

About cables you just have to go out to someplace like Frys and get a
few MacVGA cables and try them out  I have a ViewSonic 5E 14 and I
use an NEC adaptor  Other monitors may use other adaptors  I also have
a Mac832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an
Apple 16  I need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it
works fairly well

	Just like everything else in life the right lane ends in half a mile
