Subject Re DeskWriter Drivers 31  How to install 

Can someone tell me which of the files that come with DW31 go where
and for what purpose  What can be left out for instance if
you dont want to do background printing

As far as I can remember all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and
printing using the 31 driver is to drag the driver itself either serial or
appletalk depending on your needs to the system folder You dont need the
fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward bare bones basic
printingI dont have anything else installed and can still print on a
Deskwriter using sys71 and HP driver 31
