Besides the faster processor the 950 has SCSI 2 and as far as I know
faster IO due to separate processors handling those functions

    Mostly The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as its SCSI
chip but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI2
modes and therefore doesnt offer much more in the way of SCSI
performance over the Q900 It does howrever have a faster IO
controller than the Q900 this is where the real speed boost comes from
