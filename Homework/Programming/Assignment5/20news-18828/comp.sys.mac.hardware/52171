Subject Good APS experience


 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS I recently ordered
 an external Quantum 240 The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable the
 order came when promised and the invoice was at the price quoted 

 Installing the drive was simple I didnt even have to read the manual The
 SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement I daisychained the drive
 from my Syquest also from APS and booted up with no problems 

 Im still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive Its a
 pretty good assortment

 The drivefan is a bit noisier than I would like but I think itll be OK
 The speed seems very good although I havent run any objective tests It
 also seems to spin up pretty quickly I can hit the power switch for it and
 almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive

 Some observations the case is plastic good quality though while my older
 Syquest case is metal There is one LED which is normally green and
 flickers red as the drive is accessed

 Just a data point
