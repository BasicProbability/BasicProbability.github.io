A CNN factiod in the last few months stated that 40 of all the computers
in the US are left on 24 hours a day 7 days a week  I dont recall
CNNs source


	Yeah but they probably included industries and educational institutions
that uses mostly work stations SUNs DEC IBM RS600 etc etc  Which turns
monitor off if left untouched for 5 min  

None of the SUNs DECs or RS6000s Ive used have turned off the
monitor automatically
