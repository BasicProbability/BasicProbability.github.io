Subject Whats that chime

It happened to my classic ii once  At startup after the usual powerup
tone there were chimes kinda like do1stmi1stsol1stdo2nd or
1st C  1st E  1st G  2nd C on the music scale and it hanged before
giving the happy mac  I had to repowerup

This was asked before but I cant remember the answer  Ive tried to
find the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail

Can anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean  A spurious memory
check error

Thanks
willie
