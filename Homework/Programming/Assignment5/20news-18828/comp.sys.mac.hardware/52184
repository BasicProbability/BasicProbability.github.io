Subject 14 RGB owners What kind of power cable came with your monitor

Heres the scoop

For the past two years I have been using an SE30 with a Sony 1304s and
a Lapis video card  This past month I bought a Quadra 800 and am now 
using the Sony on it  My SE30 has been shipped home to my father who
is planning on getting an Apple 14 monitor The Trinitron one  My
question is this  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor  Does it come with two types  As I recall one can hook up the
power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my 
Quadra 800  However for my fathers SE30 there is no extra plug which
allows use of the SE30s power supply  He needs to plug it into the
socket separately  Sodoes the monitor come with a cable that will allow
him to do this  Will have to buy a different cable  IF yes where can he
purchase such a cable or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables

Thanks in advance
Derek
