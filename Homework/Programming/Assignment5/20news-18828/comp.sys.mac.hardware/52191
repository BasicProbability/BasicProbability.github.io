Ok I have a question why  Why do people copy the article and the 
only new thing they add to the post is there name  Im not picking on 
this person Ive seen a few of these  Is it just a mistake  Am I 
missing something  Is it some unknown netequette I missed somewhere
I skip over all the quoted material since Ive already read it and look 
for the nonquoted material and all I get is the name addition  Is this 
supposed to me I agree or I second this or what

Sorry

Just wondering if I missed something somewhere along the line
