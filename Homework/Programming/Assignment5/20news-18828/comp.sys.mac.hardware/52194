 What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
 monitor  Does it come with two types

No  I recently bought an LC II with a 14 monitor  The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs  Since the LC II doesnt have one of these outlets there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor  But it was in the computer box not the monitor box  Its
not as if the cables are particularly expensive though  1015 at the
most
