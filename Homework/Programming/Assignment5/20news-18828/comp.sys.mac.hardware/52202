PSI makes an internal fax modem for the map portable 18006221722 but 
asks too much for it retail 450 Id buy an external and save about 
350 

there is a manufacturer that still makes INTERNAL HDs for the portable 
theyre listed in some of the catalog magazines for apple stuff you can 
find at bookstores If I see it again Ill post it But again you might 
want to just add a small lightweight external HD built for the 
powerbooks Youd be able to use it with a new computer some day Any 
other mac portable questions Ill have to cry uncle

Dont blame me I voted for XXXXXXX
