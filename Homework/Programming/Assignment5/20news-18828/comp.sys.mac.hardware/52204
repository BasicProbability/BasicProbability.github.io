Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines

The more of the story is to developers DONT CHEAT
Really I am absolutely positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do
but Im going say it anyway
Stop cheating on sound
Really soon you will be sorry as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware The grace period
is about to end
The Sound Manager is understandable now and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon so use it

Dont be silly

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well but using SM on
any of the lowend machines doesnt simply work for a decent action
game since it just steals too much time from the CPU This is
a fact By writing directly to the hardware on an SE it is
possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound 11kHz for
a cost of approx 8000 cycles Exactly how would you do that using
the SM pray tell

The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can
carry that extra load using the SM means and to write directly
to the sound hardware on the machines that cant Its not the
politically correct thing but from the developers point of
view it is
