Subject Help identifying this card

	I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC The card
	is manufactured by Asante On it i can read
	Asante Tech inc Copyright 1991 MACCON  LC REVB
	The card has an fpu socket on it It provides thin Ethernet connector
	and theres another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors

	My questions are
	 Will this card work on any other model than LCserie  given that
	its a PDS card will it work with the IIsi PDS slot  I think there
	may be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots

	 Whats that other conncetor on the card 

	 Is anyone interested in it  I can ship it to any CEE country
