 I think the subject title says it all Anybody that relies on a SCSI dick
 for stoarage is a pain in the ass
 
 
Saying things like that incline one to believe that you cant get it SCSI
to work for your setup too bad Ive daisychained 4 SCSI devices off my
mac without a problem limit is 7 SCSI devices in the daisychain If it
isnt working for you its really better to state the problem unless all
you really intend to do is try to get nasty email in that case perhaps you
would be better off posting to altmasochistic type of newsgroup
