Even better than that  how does a 68000based Amiga 2000 perform in 
daily tasks compared to my 68030based IIci

Answer except in a very few cases I get my butt kicked by the Amiga

A similar reason is why people at work used to seeing SCO unix running
on a 486 are suprised when they see my Sun3 at home running faster wa 16MHz
6802068881  The Sun was designed from the ground up for UNIX the PC
wasnt

This is why you need a gargantuan processor to run Windows  The basic
design of the box is all wrong Wouldve been better if MS had put most
of Windows on a plugin ROM card from day one priced at 2495 or
so People woulda loved it

Apple had the right idea just stumbled a bit in the execution
