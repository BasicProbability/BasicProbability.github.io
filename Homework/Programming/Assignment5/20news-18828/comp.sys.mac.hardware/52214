Subject Re Apple 824 GC Video Card

 A friend of mine recently acquired an 824 GC card for his IIsi
 and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white
 I know there have been numerous reports about the worth of
 the GC but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little
 more on the subject  Any replies encouraged  Thanks in ad
 vance

Ive had similar problems w other board types and the problem is NOT a
result of the 824GC board Try Zapping the PRAM by holding down
CommandOptionPR durring startup You will have to reset everything to
your previous preferences The Date  Time remain intact but the Video
Board will start remembering its previous settings
