Subject Re AppleTalk ImageWriter LQ compatible needed

     Since Image Writer LQ was discontinued there is no Apple Talk
     printer with 1115 continous paper printer

     I would like to know is there are any possibility to connect
     an IBM compatible printer to an Apple Talk net directly or 
     with a Net Serial hardware and if I need any other software
     to do it

Ive have not found quite the solution yet The following comes from
MacUsers MiniFinders

The Grappler IIsp is a dot matrixprinter interface cartridge that
emulates the Imagewriter LQs Includes networking and spooling
software that allows multiple users 159 Orange Micro 7147792772 

If you find out any more information please let me know because in
the future I have the same problem or if anyone else has the
information please post Thanks
