 A friend of mine recently acquired an 824 GC card for his IIsi
 and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white
 I know there have been numerous reports about the worth of
 the GC but I was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little
 more on the subject  Any replies encouraged  Thanks in ad

You may have been emailed this but the IIsis power supply is not rated to
handle the GC board  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained
about its power supply  This is one result of apple providing a lowcost
computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end
computer at the time anyways that couldnt even support their own video
board  Even if this isnt what is causing your problems you might develop
one later
