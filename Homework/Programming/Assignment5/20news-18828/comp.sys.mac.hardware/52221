It was a paper from Apple Sweden that announced some new products the new
docking station was only one of them and the paper arrived before it showed
up on the price list I dont know if its still called the DuoDock Plus
in the price list it could be a mistake by someone at Apple Sweden

    Ah Ok I didnt realize that you were talking about an Apple
division other than AppleUS AppleUS being the main division is the
one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and
configurations for the majority of Apple customers and it is generally
assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple At
least thats how it has always been in this newsgroup All other Apple
divisions are apparantly free to change names and configurations if
they feel like it I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all
the time Its not a mistake its Apple Sweden giving a different name
to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it
