Has anyone had any success or experience with the HP DeskWriter v31
drivers The new driver has a nice Save as Default option which claims
to record your paper size font substitution settings etc for future

Has it happened to anyone that while printing a beep is heard and a
message is displayed of the sort Suchandsuch a window was closed
because the Finder did not have enough memory Or am I the only one
suffering from this delusion
