Subject cd300 question

Hi there
I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300 Ive been told
however that
1 The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines
   with SCSI2
2 The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
   capability which I need
3 Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with say CD150

Any comments
Thanx
