 It happened to my classic ii once  At startup after the usual powerup
 tone there were chimes kinda like do1stmi1stsol1stdo2nd or
 1st C  1st E  1st G  2nd C on the music scale and it hanged before
 giving the happy mac  I had to repowerup
 
 This was asked before but I cant remember the answer  Ive tried to
 find the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail
 
 Can anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean  A spurious memory
 check error
 
 Thanks

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose Next time you power down the computer check that all cables are on tight
