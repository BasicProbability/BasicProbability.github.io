Subject SWII on SE  System 608 or 71

Im planning on getting a StyleWriter II for my Mac SE 25 MB ram HD two
800k floppy drives  Do any of you out there have any recommendations as
to whether running System 608 is better or worse than switching to 71
I dont do much real work on this machine any more but would like to keep
it for word processing Using Word 4 and dont see much advantage to going
to Word 5 since it is slower

Any help or comments would be appreciated  Thanks in advance
