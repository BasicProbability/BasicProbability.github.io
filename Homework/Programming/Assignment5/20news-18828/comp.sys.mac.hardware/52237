 hello out in networld
 
        We have a lab of old macsSEs and Pluses We dont have enough money 
 to buy all new machines so we are considering buying a few superdrives for 
 our old macs to allow folks with high density disks to use our equipment 
 I was wondering what experiences good or bad people have had with this sort
 of upgrade

	Why dont you just shell out a couple more dollars and get a floptical   
They can read high density disks 14 MB as well as flopticals 21 MB  The  
price of flopticals right now range from 300s  400s
