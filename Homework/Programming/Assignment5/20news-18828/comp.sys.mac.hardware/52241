Sorry for the delay in replying your message only showed up today 23 Apr
on applecom QuickDraw GX is not a replacement for QuickDraw the two of
them live quite happily together You may write an app that only uses GX
if you want or you may write a hybrid app that uses both Suptayoo

    This is something I asked before but I dont think I got an answer or
maybe I lost the answer or maybe its just an obvious question  Will 
the GX stuff online docs etc be available on the DEVELOP CDs or will it 
only go out to people in the Developers program and such Just curious
