Hi there
I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300 Ive been told
however that
1 The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines
   with SCSI2

This is completely false

2 The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
   capability which I need

This is also false What you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability  which is based on the firmware and
electronics not the drive speed Ill admit though that I have
not seen a multisession capable drive that isnt double speed

3 Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with say CD150

The above 1  2 proves 3 to be false

Any comments

The Apple CD300 is an excellent doublespeed multisession PhotoCD
capable drive So are drives based on the slightlyfaster Toshiba
XM3401 Some companies selling such drives are Spin Peripherals a
bargain at 499 and PLI a company I hate and Relax Technologies
a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime
player in Mac mailorder which is usually a good sign The NEC
CDR74 is also a good choice NECs own mechanism I think ClubMac
sells it for around 619

Thanx

Your welcome ooh but now I see your from Germany Most of the
mailorder info does you little good I guess If not
Spin Peripherals  8004661200
Club Mac          8002582622
Relax Tech        5104716112

Nothing wrong with the Apple though which is based on a Sony
mechanism and speedidentical to the NEC The Toshibas speed
advantage is very slight 20 in average access time a minor plus
and 10 in data transfer rate a slightly more important plus

Good luck
Mark
