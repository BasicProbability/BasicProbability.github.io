Subject Re Centris 610 flaky

A rep at the dealer actually its a university order center so
they dont have any immediate financial interest told me that
they have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610
He didnt go into details but mentioned problems with the
floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files
It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
and software compatibility problems with the machine
Hes not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody he says to
consider a Centris 650 or a IIvx Why he would recommend a
IIvx over an LCIII I dont know but thats what he said
So what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky
machine or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early
Is your C610 working just great or is it buggy too

My 610 is working great  I havent heard of any problems  Sounds
to me like your dealer doesnt know what hes talking about  Its
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis
of problems with one machine  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII
doesnt make a lot of sense either  If this person is so convinced the 610
is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming
its a problem with all of them
