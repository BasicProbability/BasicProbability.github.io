Subject Unknown Mac board NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS NBDMA8

I need help identifying this board that I found stuffed away in a corner

As the title says all that is printed on it is NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS NBDMA8
It fits fine in my Mac IIci and snooper gives the very same name for the
board  It looks like it has an HPIB connector on the back of it and
another connector on the top 2 rows by 25 pins  It also looks like
it has an Intel processor on it A8238016 Intel 86

On an EEPROM there is a sticker with the PN 70058401

Anybody ever seen or heard of one  Or better yet do you know what it does
We are all clueless here  Our last option is to hook it up to our HP
workstations and see if any smoke comes out

Thanks a lot

Kevin
