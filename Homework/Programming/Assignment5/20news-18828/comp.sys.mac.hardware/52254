Subject 666 mhz clock oscillator Where

In my quest for speed Ive run into a problem 6666 mhz and 80 mhz
clock oscillators are available but I havent found any speeds between
6666 and 70 mhz for further testing Fox Electronics 813 6930099 can make custom oscillators but if anyone knows a source cheaper than 12osc please
let me know Some 68 and 70 mhz units would complete my speed trials on the
old Q700
