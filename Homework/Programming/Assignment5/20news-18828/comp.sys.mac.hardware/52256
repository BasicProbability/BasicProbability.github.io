 Hi
 Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  
 Apple uses in the powerbook Duos  Or in the powerbook in general
 
 What are the factors that make the Duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop  
 machine running the same processor at the same speed 25MHz 68030  How many  
 wait states are in the memory system etc  What kind of a data bus does it  
 use  32bit or 16bit  
 

   Huh  Where did you get this idea from  I think you got this
backwards  The Duos memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by 510 and the rest of the powerboks I think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster in 2 instead of 5
cycles I believe  Things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU which the Duo
doesnt have undocked  Extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too  Real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running what kind of screen
depth you are running etc

PS  The Duo is 32bit throughout
