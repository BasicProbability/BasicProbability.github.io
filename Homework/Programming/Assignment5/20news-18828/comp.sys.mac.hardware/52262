work it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front    

 This is a pet peeve of mine I wish companies would put power switches on the
 front of the equipment If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front I
 would happily power it off at night Almost every piece of computer equipment
 I ownuse has the switch on the back including external hard drives and
 modemswhy I hope frontmounted switches become the norm and soon

It is just extra wire and work to put the switch in front Usually the easiest
place to put the switch is wherever the power cord enters the machine and
people HATE power cords on the front I prefer a power strip
