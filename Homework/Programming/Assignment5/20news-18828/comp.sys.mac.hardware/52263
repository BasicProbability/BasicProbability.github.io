Subject StyleWriter II Dying

I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago and lately when I print
something I notice white lines or gaps running through the line being
printed  Its almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when
advancing lines  

I replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem but the lines
are still there  Has anyone else noticed this problem  Whats the best way to
get rid of it
