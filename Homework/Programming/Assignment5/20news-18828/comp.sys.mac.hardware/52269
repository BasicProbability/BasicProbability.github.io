 I need help identifying this board that I found stuffed away in a corner
 
 As the title says all that is printed on it is NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS NBDMA8
 It fits fine in my Mac IIci and snooper gives the very same name for the
 board  It looks like it has an HPIB connector on the back of it and
 another connector on the top 2 rows by 25 pins  It also looks like
 it has an Intel processor on it A8238016 Intel 86
 
 On an EEPROM there is a sticker with the PN 70058401
 
 Anybody ever seen or heard of one  Or better yet do you know what it does
 We are all clueless here  Our last option is to hook it up to our HP
 workstations and see if any smoke comes out
