 Hi
 I have a question
    Which is the diference between Performa 450 and LCIII
    I want to know which is better
    If you know the specifications and the prices of this computers can
 you tell me by email to  rcvillabislugapuccl
    Id like to know the diference between the apple monitor14 and the 
 performa monitor too
 
 	Performa 200  Classic II
 	Performa 400  LC II
 	Performa 4xx  LC III
 	Performa 600  well nothing 
 
 	The Performas are made to be lowcost business solutions  The 4xx have
 bundled software modems etc
 	Because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper
 discount on them  Shop around
 
 	As far as the monitors go buy 3rd party  Much cheaper

Hmmm thats not quite right  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx but a better buy IMO  I also dont think they are so
much a lowcost business solution but a lowcost home solution
Why else bundle at ease among other things  Hardly a business
application 

What do you mean by no retail price  Quite the contrary I think
The price is darn near the same all across the country  That again
IMO was one of the selling points of the performas  ie no haggling
required  Kinda like the Saturn car of the computer set  One
price medium performance ready to go

When I shopped for my Performa 600CD the difference between Sears
sigh Montgomery Wards Silo sigh Circuit City sigh and
Bizmart sigh couldnt have been 10000  Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples  Admittedly except for Montgomery Wards and I
suspect I was just lucky all of the salesfolk I spoke to didnt know
didly about the computers peecee or mac  But then neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with

If you wouldve told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long long time  Go figure
Im real happy with my Performa  Oh and I bought the Apple
Performa Plus monitor vs buying 3rd party  Happy with that
decision as well  I walked in plopped down some cash and walked out
with a spankin new computer the day before Christmas
