 Actually I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day

Nope  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a
usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour I run uAccess
and receives all my faxes

I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it  They produce more heat
than I want  it can be warm in my garage office in the summer  Ive
got one of those handy power control centers 25 at Frys to I just
flip the switch in front when I start or stop working

By the way this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since
their new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
length of idle time
