 Is your C610 working just great or is it buggy too

A lot of the time when youre dealing with someone who has no financial  
interest in selling you the machine you get a lot of opinion as opposed  
to factual information etc  What it sounds like to me is that this guy  
has had an experience with one flaky Centris 610 and formed an  
allencompassing opinion on the rest of the 610s  Ive seen lots of  

Yes that is what it sounds like to me too But before I spend
da bucks I want to make sure Im right I do have email from
a selfconfessed  Applehater listing a few common problems
with the C610 but nothing I cant get fixed under warranty

So anybody else Great or lousy
