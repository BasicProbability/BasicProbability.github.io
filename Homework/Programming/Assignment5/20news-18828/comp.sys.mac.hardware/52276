Subject SVGA and PowerBook 160


	OKhere is my question  I want to hook up my PowerBook 160 to
a SVGA monitor but I do not want to buy the PowerBookDOS Companion  Can
anyone tell me the EXACT cable I need to connect them  If there is such
a cable can I purchase it from MacWharehouse or some computer store
If I must buy the cable from James Engineering how much do they run and
how can I get a hold them  I guess that was more than a question  
Thanks in advance for any replys
