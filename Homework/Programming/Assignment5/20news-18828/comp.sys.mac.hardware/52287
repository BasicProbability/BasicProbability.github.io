 The US Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance
 with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy
 efficient PCs that power down automatically when not being used

this is a bad idea my machine is on 24 hours a day but its actually 
doing things 24 hours a day i use it as an all purpose alarm clock 
scheduler ive got routines that run in the middle of the night phone 
calls it makes during the day when im out if your machine is on 24 hours 
a day then you can count on it to be working 24 hours a day i could call 
it from work and download a file that i might need i could call it from 
work and have it turn the lights on if im going to be late oops more 
wasted electricity  but conversely i could have it turn the lights 
off heck i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have dinner 
ready when i get there

oh well nevermind im just babbling
