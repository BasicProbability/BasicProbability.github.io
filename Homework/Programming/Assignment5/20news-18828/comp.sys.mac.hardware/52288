From debugwsuhubuctwsuedu

	Hi

	I own a IIsi and Im considering buying a Powerbook  Can
anyone give me a listing of all the models and tell me what Im looking for
ie passive matrix vs active memory sizes upgradeability internal modems
disk size  If you could provide some prices too that would help  Im not
informed enough on Powerbooks to know how well they operate  
	I have been following the posts on some of the problems that have been
encountered such as the trackball not working in the horizontal
	I would appreciate the list as well as any advice you may have

		Thanks in advance
