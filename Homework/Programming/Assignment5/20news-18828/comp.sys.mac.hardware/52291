Subject Re Centris 610 flaky

Ive been playing with a centris 610 8230 for the last couple weeks  The only
problem that I have seen is that a couple of the applications I run are
incompatible with the 040s processor cache so I have to run with it turned off
Actually the main thing I dont like it is that it doesnt have a software
poweruppowerdown and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE  I
havent hit it thinking it would eject the disk but some tired night Im going
to be really upset with that design decision

In all no problems with it floppy and printing have been just fine  printing
is done across a localtalk net not a directly connected printer
