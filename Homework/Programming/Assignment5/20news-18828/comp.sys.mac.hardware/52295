Subject Tones o death 

Hi I just test installed kanjitalk 607 on my IIci 
and got a black screen a way sick looking mac icon and when hitting the
programmers reset a tone sequence that I guess is the infamous tones of
death 
I was able to reboot off a floppy removed the japanese system and
set up the system folder on the hard drive to get system 701 back
Now have no overt problems with the mac
Any idea what caused the tones  I forget the numbers but 7fff comes to mind
If it is some self diagnostic why would an older system version catch it
and not 7 
Ill be moving up to 71 and worldscript byandby
Thanks in advance
Hiroki
