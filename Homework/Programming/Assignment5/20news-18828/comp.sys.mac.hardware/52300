Subject Recs on  Mac Video System Cards Software

What would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the
following nature

Reading real video in for playbak in various apps 510 Minnutes in length
Basic editing features for said video  rearange sequences adding grapic
slides from something like power point etc 

Im not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp
performance  Its for educationalpromotional things so the video quality
should be decent

Im thinking Tempest or cyclone Big driveloads o ram Floptical or 128Mb
optical   however Im not to sure of the various cards and software
thats out there
