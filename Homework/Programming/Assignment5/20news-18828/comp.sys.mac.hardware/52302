Subject Re LCIII or used IIci  which should I get

I am at long last going to replace my beloved 512ke
I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci  Prices
have yet to be worked out so Im just thinking right now
about their merits and drawbacks

Heres what Ive thought of

The IIci has much greater potential for expansion a la NuBus and
greater memory capacity

The LC III would be new under warranty newer ROMs is the IIci
32bit clean and would have sound input  I also like the
pizzabox case

Performancewise I have read that they are almost identical the
LC III being a little slower

So which should I get

Yes the IIci has 32bit clean ROMs
 
Either model would be a good choice  Another option get a new IIci
from a dealer that hasnt sold out yet  Also dont forget the Performa
405 which I believe is the same as an LCIII but may be packaged with
more goodies for a better price
