 I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci  Prices

 The IIci has much greater potential for expansion a la NuBus and
 greater memory capacity

How important is this How many NuBus cards do you haveplan to
acquire How much memory do you really need Ive got a ci and
20mb of ram Thats plenty I also have a 24bit graphics card
on the NuBus  Im a sucker for pretty picturesI think the
LCIII can have a bootable ramdisk in memory which a ci can
not have At least not out of the box

 The LC III would be new under warranty newer ROMs is the IIci
 32bit clean and would have sound input  I also like the
 pizzabox case

The ci is 32bit clean I solved the sound input problem with
a MacRecorder But thats gotten to be a fairly expensive
solution now that Macromind owns MacRecorder

 Performancewise I have read that they are almost identical the
 LC III being a little slower

The actual difference is probably not worth worrying over
 
 So which should I get

Depends on the price you can get the ci for Educationally speaking
the 480  LCIII here at FSU can be had at just under 1300 Add
in roughly 500 for a monitor Last Id heard an 8mb LCIII simm
went for 250 

I think youre in a winwin situation No matter what you decide
youll most likely be happy with it
