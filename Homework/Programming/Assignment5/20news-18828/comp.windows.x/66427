Subject Re Drawing colour pixmaps  not rectangular

   I am writing a program which needs to draw colour XPM pixmap files onto a background without having the borders show up I cannot do xor as the colours all stuff up I cannot use XCopyPlane as that is for single planes only I want to be able to specify a colour in the pixmap to be used as the opaque colour Is this possible 
 
 Games such as xjewel have the same problem How does the mouse pointer do it
 
 Any help would be helpful 
 

You wanna do masking Build a bitmap pixmap of depth one where all pixels
you name opaque are 1 that get copied and the others are 0 Use this
bitmap as the clipmask in the gc used for XCopyArea and remember to
adjust the cliporigin coordinates to the XCopyArea blit origin

The Mouse pointer besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares uses a mask too

But be warned blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers it flickers even at 40 MIPS
