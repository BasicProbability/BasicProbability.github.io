Subject   7  How do I ask a netquestion so as to maximize helpful responses

	When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing  The more specific you
are the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing  Without
all the details people who want to help you often have to guess  if they are
able to respond at all

	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it 
from If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system
give details of that too  Give the machine type operating system and OS 
version for both the client and server machine  It may also be appropriate to 
mention the window manager compiler and display hardware type you are using

	Then tell exactly what you are doing exactly what happens and what
you expectedwanted to happen  If it is a command that fails include the 
exact transcript of your session in the message  If a program you wrote 
doesnt work the way you expect include as little of the source necessary 
just a small test case please for readers to reproduce the problem

Subject  10  What is the ICCCM How do I write Xfriendly applications

	The InterClient Communication Conventions Manual is one of the 
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment It 
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with 
other clients sharing the same server  If you are writing X clients you need 
to read and understand the ICCCM  in particular the sections discussing the 
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window 
manager  Get it either
	 as part of the R4 distribution from MIT
	 in the later editions of the ScheiflerGettys X Window System book
	 as an appendix in the new version of OReillys Volume 0 X Protocol
Reference Manual A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete
	The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable thanks to 
the efforts of Digital Presss editors to improve the English and the 
presentation

from David Rosenthal 1090

	 the ICCCM was updated for R5 updates are published in OReillys
Programmers Supplement for Release 5 The complete document is on the R5
tapes

Subject  11  What is the X Consortium and how do I join

	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of 
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment
	MITs role is to provide the vendorneutral architectural and 
administrative leadership required to make this work Membership in the 
Consortium open to any organization  There are two categories of membership 
Member for large organizations and Affiliate for smaller organizations
	Most of the Consortiums activities take place via electronic mail 
with meetings when required  As designs and specifications take shape
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations  
Typically a small multiorganization architecture team leads the design with 
others acting as close observers and reviewers  Once a complete specification
is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium
as a proposed standard  The standards process typically includes public 
review outside the Consortium and a demonstration of proof of concept
	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or 
Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed

Subject  12  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces GUIs OPEN LOOK
was developed by Sun with help from ATT and many industry reviewers Motif was
developed by the Open Software Foundation OSF with input from many OSF 
members 

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a userinterface specification and styleguide 
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications
Motif includes an API specification the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the 
one from OSF However there are other toolkits which can be used to produce 
programs which look and behave like OSFMotif one of these ParcPlaces 
formerly Solbournes OI is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the
style of OPEN LOOK and Motif at the users choice

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from ATT comprising 
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications

Subject  15  What is PEX

	PEX is the PHiGS Extension to X
	PHiGS stands for Programmers Hierarchical Interactive Graphics 
System and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation 
and manipulation of 3D graphics Many platforms are capable of performing in 
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects the extension 
allows the client PHiGS in this case to take advantage of the specialized 
hardware for 3D graphics
	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely 
redistributable copyright similar to the current X copyright sample
implementation  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release
Several vendors are currently selling independentlydeveloped PEX servers for 
their workstations and X terminals

Subject  16  What is lowbandwidth X LBX XRemote PPP SLIP CSLIP

There are several options for using X over serial lines

SLIP  Serial Line IP this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP
packets over pointtopoint serial links It has been around for several years
and implementations are available for many of the major TCPIP implementations
Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really 
ever uses it since it is horribly slow  The TCPIP headers add 40 bytes per 
packet and the TCPIP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose rightfully 
so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over highspeed links 

CSLIP  Compressed header SLIP this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 
40 bytes of TCPIP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes  It still doesnt do 
anything about reencoding the X protocol  Modems that do compression can help
but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed 
data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time

PPP  PointtoPoint Protocol this is an emerging standard for pointtopoint
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
SLIP  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial 
line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for 
running normal TCPIP protocols over serial lines  Running raw X over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable

XRemote  this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines  In addition 
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPPCSLIP XRemote removes 
redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and 
using LZW to compress the entire data stream  This work is done by either a 
pseudoX server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server  There 
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem
   1	You dont have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldnt 
	otherwise be using them eg if you were going to be directly 
	connected and
   2	It reduces the IO overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
	have to cross the serial interface and
   3	In addition to the effects of 2 it reduces the latency in delivering 
	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for 
	blocks to compress

LBX  Low Bandwidth X this is an X Consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using 
NCDs XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol  LBX
will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonlyused information 
eg connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps 
etc and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol The hope is to have a 
Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample 
implementation available in R6

LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu

Subject  17  TOPIC USING X IN DAYTODAY LIFE

Subject  18 What are all these different window managers

	The window manager in X is just another client  it is not part of the
X window system although it enjoys special privileges  and so there is
no single window manager instead there are many which support different ways 
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout
decoration and keyboard and colormap focus In approximate chronological order
generally the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM

	wm this simple titlebar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3
	uwm the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed 
although it is very outdated Moved to contrib on the R4 tape
	twm old Toms Window Manager was among the first nonMIT window 
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
reparenting window manager 
	awm the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features dynamic menus not found on more current window managers
	cwm cwm is part of the Andrew system 
	rtl Siemens window manager tiles windows so that they dont overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size
	dxwm Digitals dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering
	hpwm HPs window manager offers a 3D look it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm the Motif window manager is part of the OSFMotif toolkit
	tekwm Tektronixs window manager offering 
	olwm Sun olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style
Guide functionality
	olwm ATT ditto
	gwm Bulls Generic Window Manager emulates others with a builtin
Lisp interpreter Version 17h 1091 is on the R5 contrib tape 17n is on
avahiinriafr and exportlcsmitedu 393
	mswm the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape
	pswm Suns PostScriptbased pswm is part of the OpenWindows release
	swm Solbournes swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple
GUI support and also a panned virtual window configuration information comes
from the resources file
	twm new MITs new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives including the one on the R5 tape
	vtwm vtwm offers some of the virtualdesktop features of swm with a
singleroot window implementation it is based on the R4 twm and is available
on archive servers A new version vtwm50 is based on R59 and is available 
from export 392
	tvtwm Toms Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtualroot window of swm It is
available on archive servers
	olvwm the vtwmstyle virtualdesktop added to Suns olwm It is 
available on archive servers version 33 193 is on export
	mvwm the vtwmstyle virtualdesktop added to OSFs mwm A beta version
is floating around most recently from sureshunipalmcouk but requires a 
source license to OSFMotif 113 392
	NCDwm the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look 
	XDSwm the window manager local to Visual Technologys terminals 
	ctwm Claude Lecommandeurs lecomsicepflch modification of the R5 
twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm source is on export
Version 222 293 also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm
	vuewm HPs MWMbased window manager offers configurable workspaces
	4Dwm SGIs enhanced MWM
	piewm this version of tvtwm offers pie menus


Subject  19  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager sic

	It neednt  What is probably happening is that you are running your 
window manager as the last job in your xsession or xinitrc file your X 
session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your 
window manager is equivalent to logging out Instead run the window manager in
the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like
		exec xterm name Login rv iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action
Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager


Subject  20  Can I save the state of my X session like toolplaces does

	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature 
which may be equivalent to writing out a xinitrc or xsession file naming the
geometry and WMCOMMAND of each application but olvwm may have something 
close  there is a contributed application which does much of what you are 
looking for although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces 
Look for the application xplaces on an archiveserver near you There are 
several versions of this program floating around look for a recent vintage
1090
	Some new pseudo sessionmanagers such as HPs vuewm provide for the 
saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currentlyrunning
applications and the resource database 
Bjxrn Stabell bjoernsstaffcsuitno 393
 

Subject  21  How do I use another window manager with DECs session manager

	DECs session manager will start dxwm up by default To override this 
add to your Xdefaults file something like this line naming the full pathname
	smwindowManagerName   whereverusrbinX11yourfavoritewm


Subject  22  How do I change the keyboard autorepeat rate

	You can turn autorepeat on or off by using xset r onoff The X
protocol however doesnt provide for varying the autorepeat rate which is
a capability not supported by all systems
	Some servers running on systems that support this however may provide
commandline flags to set the rate at startup time If you have control over 
server startup see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the 
server with the chosen settings for example you can start the Xsun server 
from MIT with the options ar1 350 ar2 30 to reduce the sensitivity of the 
keyboard


Subject  23  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key The xmodmap client which is useful 
for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places just rearranges keys and 
does not do macro expansion
	Some few clients including xterm and several Xbased editors 
accept a translation resource such as
	xtermVT100Translations override 
		KeyF1 stringsetenv DISPLAY unix0
which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients To include control
characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include
	Window managers which could provide this facility do not yet nor
has a special remapper client been made available
