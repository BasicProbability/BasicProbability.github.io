Subject  24 How do I make a screendump or print my application

	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background It produces an XWDformat file of the image of that window 
The file can be postprocessed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism You can use this command
		csh sleep 10 xwd root  outputxwd 
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen the entire current
display will be saved into the file outputxwd Note that xwd also has an
undocumented before R5 id flag for specifying the window id on the 
commandline There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for 
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture

	Two publiclyavailable programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and builtin delays are asnap and xgrabsc
There are several versions of xgrabsc version 22 available on export 892
is the most recent
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it it also renders 
XPM output version unknown It is available on export or avahiinriafr
see xsnappl2tarZ
	A screendump and mergeedit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernamcsuwmedu as xdump10tarZ Information 
softengcsuwmedu
	xprint by Alberto Accomazzi albertocfaharvardedu is available
from cfa0 128103401 in xprintexport21tarZ

	To postprocess the xwd output of some of these tools you can use xpr
which is part of the X11 distribution Also on several archives are xwd2ps
and XtoPS which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations see exportlcsmiteducontribxwd2pstarZ and
contribImageMagicktarZ Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output

	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display manipulate it and
save it in one of the available formats ImageMagick has similar capabilities

	Also 

	Bristol Technology infobristolcom 2034386969 offers Xprinter 
20 an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers a demo is on ftpuunet
in vendorBristolXprinter

	ColorSoft 96194598500 offers OPENprint package includes a screen
capture facility imageprocessing and support for PostScript and 
nonPostScript printers

	Some vendors implementations of X eg DECWindows and OpenWindows 
include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion
of screen or take a snapshot options Some platforms also have tools which 
can be used to grab the framebuffer directly the Sun systems for example 
have a screendump program which produces a Sun raster file Some X terminals 
have local screendump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer

	Some vendors implementations of lpr eg Sony include direct 
support for printing xwd files but youll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer


Subject  25  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display

	If you need color PostScript in particular you can 
	 grab the screenimage using a program which can produce color 
PostScript such as xgrabsc and xv 
	 grab the screenimage using xwd and postprocess xwd into color PS
You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution The PBMPLUS package is also good for this as is the Xim package


Subject  26  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor

	This cant be done unless the X server has been extended Consider 
instead a systemdependent mechanism for eg  capturing the framebuffer


Subject  27  How do I convertview MacTIFFGIFSunPICTimgFAX images in X

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzers useful 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit which includes a number of programs for converting

Subject  28  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell
		echo ESC2TEXTG
where ESC is the escape key TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed
and G is a ControlG the BEL character

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories
		alias newcd cd  echo n ESC2cwdG

	The digit 2 in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon use the digit 0 instead and use 1 to change only the 
icon name

	Note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself

	Note on an IBM RS6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a V


Subject  29  Where can I find the xterm control sequences

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file 
ctlseqsms a PostScript version is in mithardcopyclientsctlseqsPSZ

OReillys Volume 3 the X Users Guide includes an R5 version of the control 
sequences the standard volume will be available 393 and a Motif version of 
the book is available now The current R4 guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences 193

Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document
and also the file in the R4 sources called mitclientsxtermctlseq2txt a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro GE CRD listing the VT100 
sequences It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December 1989 XNextEvent the XUG newsletter

In a pinch a VT100 manual will do

last updated 1091


Subject  30 Why does the R3 xterm et al fail against the R4 server

Subject  31  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm 

	In order to use special characters such as the oumlaut you need to 
stty pass8 but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font such as 
	XTermfont 	mediumrnormal130ciso88591
	XTermboldfont	boldrnormal130ciso88591
The family is intentionally unspecified in this example

In addition you may want to set this in your shell
	setenv LCCTYPE iso88591

        For a given character above 127 you can determine the key to use with 
the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 try using
man ascii For example oumlaut v is Altv and the section character  
is Alt

Subject  32  Why are my xterm menus so small

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally If you give 
a resource specification like this
		xtermgeometry 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24 For the main window this is OK as it uses characters for its size 
But its popup menus dont they are in pixels and show up small To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly
		xtermVT100geometry 80x24


Subject  33  How can I print the current selection

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command 
However a program by Richard Hesketh rlh2ukcacuk specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help eg 
	 xselection PRIMARY  lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it This command can be placed in a 
windowmanager menu or in shellscripts xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties A version is on export
	Also available is riaccsuwocapubxgetselectiontarZ which can be
adapted to do this


Subject  34  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources

	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are 
loaded for your Xtbased programs  XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and 
XAPPLRESDIR  These environment variables control where Xt looks for 
applicationdefaults files as an application is initializing  Xt loads at most
one appdefaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from
the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a 
way that appdefaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies
Suppose for example that you are running Suns Open Windows and you also 
have some R4 X applications installed in usrlibX11appdefaults You could 
set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH and it would cause Xt to look up 
appdefaults files in both usrlibX11 and usropenwinlib or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located
	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH usrlibX11TNOPENWINHOMElibTN

The value of this environment variable is a colonseparated list of pathnames  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see 
XtResolvePathname

        N      The value of the filename parameter or the
                applications class name
        T      The value of the file type  In this case the
                literal string appdefaults
        C      customization resource R5 only
        S      Suffix  None for appdefaults
        L      Language locale and codeset eg jaJPEUC
        l      Language part of L  eg ja
        t      The territory part of the displays language string
        c      The codeset part of the displays language string

	Lets take apart the example  Suppose the applications class name is 
Myterm Also suppose Open Windows is installed in usropenwin Notice the 
example omits localespecific lookup
	usrlibX11TN        means usrlibX11appdefaultsMyterm
	OPENWINHOMElibTN    means usropenwinlibappdefaultsMyterm

	As the application initializes Xt tries to open both of the above 
appdefaults files in the order shown  As soon as it finds one it reads it 
and uses it and stops looking for others  The effect of this path is to 
search first in usrlibX11 then in usropenwin

	Lets consider another example This time lets set 
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Mytermad in the current working 
directory then for Myterm in the directory appdefaults
	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH NadHOMEappdefaultsN

	The first path in the list expands to Mytermad  The second expands 
to HOMEappdefaultsMyterm  This is a convenient setting for debugging 
because it follows the Imake convention of naming the appdefaults file 
Mytermad in the applications source directory so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly  NOTE when looking for appdefault files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH
for some  bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so T and
S are useless

	With R5 theres another twist  You may specify a customization 
resource value  For example you might run the myterm application like this
	myterm xrm customization color

	If one of your pathname specifications had the value
usrlibX11TNC then the expanded pathname would be
usrlibX11appdefaultsMytermcolor because the C substitution character 
takes on the value of the customization resource

	The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled into Xt is
		usrlibX11LTNC  R5
		usrlibX11lTNC  R5
		usrlibX11TNC     R5
		usrlibX11LTN
		usrlibX11lTN
		usrlibX11TN

	Note some sites replace usrlibX11 with a ProjectRoot in
this batch of default settings

	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled into Xt is 
		rootLNC  R5
		rootlNC  R5
		rootNC     R5
		rootLN
		rootlN
		rootN

	root is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the users home directory 
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other 
than the default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether

	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find 
your appdefaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR 
to  a single dot  In R3 all this machinery worked differently for R3 
compatibilty many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to  a dot followed 
by a slash

Subject  35  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the login window

The answer lies in changing xdms xrdb resource in the xdmconfig file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources for example 
your usrlibX11xdmxdmconfig file may add the line 
	DisplayManager0authorize false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before login beware and also 
	DisplayManagerxrdb	usrlibX11xdmnewxrdb
where that file does something for all connections along the lines of
	binsh
	comes in with arguments display 0 load usrlibX11xdmXresources
	usrbinX11xsetroot display 2 bitmap usrlibX11xdmnewbitmap
	usrbinX11xrdb 
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste  Note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client

Thanks to Jay Bourland jaybcauchystanfordedu 991


Subject  36  Why isnt my PATH set when xdm runs my xsession file

	When xdm runs your xsession it doesnt source your cshrc or login
files You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script
or you can place all environmentsetting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or
if you set your PATH in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your 
xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script ie by starting
your xsession file off with bincsh 
	If this doesnt work also try starting off with
		binsh
		 Reset path
		PATHcsh c echo PATH  export PATH


Subject  37  How do I keep my DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv DISPLAY 
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X
	One solution is to use the clientsxrsh on the R5 contrib tape  It 
includes xrsh a script to start an X application on remote machine and
xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine
A more recent version is on export in xrsh54shar
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
mouselarrymcrcimmcgilledu You can ftp caveatemptor versions from
13220611 in Xxrloginc and Xxrlogindc The program packages up TERM and
DISPLAY into a single string which is stuffed into TERM  rlogin then 
propagates TERM normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval xrlogind
where xrlogind is a program that checks TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables 1190

	In addition if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host and you find
		rsh HOST n usrbinX11xterm display DISPLAY 
too simple DISPLAY must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh HOST xterm

   binsh
   start an X11 process on another host
   Date 8 Dec 88 062934 GMT
   From Chris Torek chrismimsyumdedu

   An improved version
   rXcmd suggested by John Robinson jrbbncom
         generalized for shksh by Keith Boyer keithcisohiostateedu

Subject  38  How can I design my own font

	One way is to use the bitmap client or some other bitmapeditor eg
Suns iconeditor tool postprocessed with pbmplus to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of postprocessing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format See Ollie Joness article in the November 91 X 
Journal for more information
	The R3 contrib area in fontsutils and in clientsxtroff contained 
a number of useful utilities including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor
	An easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a
version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contribclientsxfed Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftpInformatikUniDortmundDE 1292176463 
possibly as file pubwindowsXDiverseX11SourcenxfedtarZ It can produce
BDFformat fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps cursors
XPM1 pixmaps and fonts Binaries for common machines are on avahiinriafr in
pub in addition the sources an old Xlib implementation have been placed 
591 in exportcontrib 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use mftobdf from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK GF and PXL fonts to BDF format the distribution
is on ftpcscoloradoedu and on exportlcsmitedu
	The GNU package fontutils04tarZ on prepaimitedu includes xbfe
a font editor and a number of utilities for massaging font formats
	The OReilly X Resource issue 2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font
	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotanis bdfresize a new version is
in ftpcstitechacjpX11contrib


Subject  39  Why does adding a font to the server not work sic

	After you have built the font using your systems fontcompiler 
installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your systems equivalent
eg bldfamily for OpenWindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp 
dir to add that full pathname to the servers fontpath or if the 
directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found it is this last step that youre probably 
leaving out You can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in 
the path
	Sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a BadValue error
		X Error of failed requestBadValue
			integer parameter out of range for operation
		Major opcode of failed request  51 XSetFontPath

	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server  The
mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious

 Is the font directory youre specifying readable from the SERVERs file
   system  Remember its the server not the client which interprets your
   font directory  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
   xset command with shell metacharacters in it eg xset fp myfonts and
   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm

 Is the directory really a font directory  If youre running an MIT server
   or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file
   fontsdir  If you cant find that file run mkfontdir1  If youre
   running OpenWindows look for the file Familieslist  If you cant find
   it run bldfamily1

 If youre in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a
   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats OpenWindows for
   example make sure the font directory is right for the server youre using
   Hint if the directory contains pcf andor snf files it wont work for
   Open Windows  If the directory contains ff andor fb files it wont work
   for X11Rn

Subject  40  How do I convert a snf font back to bdf font

	A tool called snftobdf 14 is part of the bdftools package which is 
available from exportlcsmiteducontribbdftoolstarZ and from 
crlnmsuedupubmiscbdftoolstarZ  291


Subject  41  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format

	der Mouses getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and 
produces a BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it  It can be 
used as an anythingtoBDF converter but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf getbdf is on 13220611 in Xgetbdfc or available via mail 
from mouselarryMcRCIMMcGillEDU 591
	In addition the R5 program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that
the R5 server has access to


Subject  42  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my nonDECwindows server

	The DECwindows fonts typically dont exist on a nonDEC installation
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size Pick up the file 
contribDECwindowsonX11R4fontaliases from exportlcsmitedu this file is 
for a standard MIT R4 server  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme


Subject  43  How do I add bdf fonts to my DECwindows server

	The format of fonts preferred by DECs X server is the pcf format
You can produce this compiled format from the bdf format by using DECs dxfc
fontcompiler Note that the DEC servers can also use raw bdf fonts with a
performance hit


Subject  44 How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file What is XPM
I want to be able to do something like this
	xclockbackgroundPixmap      usrincludeX11bitmapsrootweave

	You cant do this The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen not a bitmap which is a pixmap of depth 1 Because 
of this writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps Therefore 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets however
courtesy Chris D Peterson now kiticscom 490

However
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 1290 by Sebastian Wangnick 
bastiunidoinformatikunidortmundde it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap

	The leading generalpurpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs including the GWM window manager by
ATT in its olpixmap editor and by ICS in its interface builder XPM 
distribution available on export as contribxpmtarZ includes readwrite 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner  See information
on the xpmtalk mailing list above XPM 30f was announced in 393 and is
available from exportlcsmitedu and avahiinriafr an older version is on 
the R5 contrib tape A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen 
anthonykurangocitgueduau is on export in contribAIcons


Subject  45  Why cant I override translations Only the first item works

	You probably have an extra space after the specification of the first 
item like this
	basictexttranslations  override 
	CtrlKeya    beginningofline n 	
	CtrlKeye    endofline
					       extra space
The newline after that space is ending the translation definition
Thanks to Timothy J Horton 591


Subject  46  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones

	One solution is xchron in Volume 6 of compsourcesx which can show
the time for timezones other than the local one 
	Alternatively you can probably set the timezone in the shell from
which you invoke the xclock or oclock or use a script similar to this
	binsh
	TZPST8PDT xclock name SanLuisObispoCA 2 devnull 
	TZEST5EDT xclock name KingOfPrussiaPA 2 devnull 


Subject  47  I have xmh but it doesnt work Where can I get MH

	The xmh mailreader requires the Rand MH mailmessage handling system
which is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines A list 
of various ftp uucp email and USmail sites for both xmh and MH is given in 
the monthly MH FAQ one source is icsuciedu in the file pubmhmh67tarZ
If you do not receive the compmailmh newsgroup or the MHusers mailing list 
you can request a copy of the FAQ which also includes a section on xmh 
by sending mail to mailserverpitmanagermitedu containing the request
send usenetnewsanswersmhfaq


Subject  48  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server
After a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started no
other clients are able to connect to it

	The default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun for 403 at least
delete old unreferenced files from tmp  including tmpX11unix which 
contains the socket descriptor used by X The solution is to add  type s to
the find exclusion in the cron job

Subject  49  Why dont the R5 PEX demos work on my mono screen

The R5 sample server implementation works only on color screens sorry


Subject  50 How do I get my Sun Type45 keyboard fully supported by Xsun
 
Many users wants the Num Lock key to light the Num Lock LED and have the 
appropriate effect on the numeric keypad The Xsun server as distributed by MIT
doesnt do this but there are two different patches available

Subject  51  How do I report bugs in X

	Generally report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you
with the X Window System If you received the R5 source distribution directly 
from MIT please read the file mitbugreport for instructions Look in
mitdocbugsbugreport in R4

Thanks to Stephen Gildea gildeaexpolcsmitedu 591 1291


Subject  52  Why do I get Warning Widget class version mismatch

	This error which typically goes on to say widget 11004 vs 
intrinsics 11003 indicates that the header files you included when building 
your program didnt match the header files that the Xt library youre linking 
against was built with check your I include path and L linkpath to be sure
	However the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the 
X11R4 Xt library before patch 10 the version number was wrong Some Sun OW
systems in particular were shipped with the flawed version of the library 
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you
have seen


Subject  53  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster

	Websters still owns the copyright to the online copies of Websters
Dictionary which are found at various university sites After it became aware
that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster 
and gnuemacswebster it asked that server sites close off external access
	The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary A
Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from iuvaxcsindianaedu 
12979254192 in pubwebsterNeXT20
	Unless you want to get a legal online copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access you are probably out of luck 

	However if you are a legitimate site youll want to pick up the
latest xwebster asis on exportcontribxwebstertarZ 1091 the file 
xwebsterREADME includes discussions of the availability illegality and 
nonavailability of dictionary servers

Subject  54  TOPIC OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE

Subject  55  Is X publicdomain software

	No The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not 
public domain which has a specific legal meaning However the X 
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee
	Contributed software though may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors


Subject  56  How compatible are X11R3 R4 and R5 What changes are there

The Release Notes for each MIT release of X11 specify the changes from the 
previous release  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility 
across releases  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary 
details are given in the Release Notes  Each X11 distribution site on the 
network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer the 
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree

Stephen Gildea 192

The compwindowsxintrinsics FAQXt lists Xt differences among these versions


Subject  57 Where can I get X11R5 source andor binaries

Information about MITs distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and QIC24 tape 
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from 
Software Center Technology Licensing Office Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology 28 Carleton Street Room E32300 Cambridge MA 021421324
phone 6172588330

directory the notes list changes from previous versions of X and offer a
guide to the distribution
