Subject lost in TekHVC color space

please respond via email

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working  Im not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from exportlcsmitedu or with
OReillys ftpable example xcms from ftpuunet

The OReilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
which makes no sense to me

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values  So
you cant actually edit any colors

We have X11 R5 patch level 22 8bit pseudoColor visual  Ive poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea whats going wrong  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
abovementioned programs work on their systems or let me know if they fail 
for you too  Please include what hardwaresoftwarepatch levels you have

Any hints

Please respond with email as I dont regularly read this group

Thanks
Karen
