Subject  58 Where can I get patches to X11R5

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the compwindowsxannounce newsgroup

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X11 is available They are now also distributed through the 
newsgroup compsourcesx Some source resellers may be including patches in 
their source distributions of X11

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server It now has 
23 patches for X11R5 393  Send to xstuffexpolcsmitedu the Subject line
		send fixes 
where  is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch

	Here are a few complications
	1 fix 5 is in four parts you need to request 5a 5b 5c and 
5d separately
	2 the file sunGXuu which was part of an earlier patch was 
rereleased with patch 7 note the file doesnt work with Solaris
	3 fix 8 is in two parts 8a and 8b
	4 fix 13 is in three parts 13a 13b and 13c
	5 fix 16 is in two parts 16a and 16b
	6 fix 18 replaces the R5fixtest1 for the X Test Suite which 
previously was optional
	7 fix 19 also needs PEXlibtarZ which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for PEXlibuu1234
	8 fix 22 is in 9 parts 22a through 22i


Subject  59  What is the xstuff mailarchive

	The xstuff server is a mailresponse program That means that you mail 
it a request and it mails back the response
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line The
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can 
have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help 
The xstuff server treats the Subject header line just like any other line 
of the message
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories  Each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an 
index The toplevel index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it

	1 The command help or send help causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file
	2 if your message contains a line whose first word is index then 
the server will send you the toplevel index of the contents of the archive If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the toplevel index 
For example you can say send index fixes or index fixes A message that 
requests an index cannot request data
	3 if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the
xstuff server will send you the items named on the rest of the line To name 
an item you give its directory and its name For example
                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
	You may issue multiple send requests The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day If the work queue contains more requests than the 
days quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its days quota it sends the requests out 
shortestfirst
	4 Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses  If you use such a mailer you wont get any response  If 
you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like
        path foobarbitnetmitvmamitedu
or
        path barfoofrotz
in the body of your message and the daemon will use it

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuffexpolcsmitedu If 
your mailer deals in  notation try sending to 
someplacemiteddieexpolcsmiteduxstuff

Subject  62  Does Motif work with X11R4 X11R5

	Motif 12 is based on X11R5
	Motif 11 available in source form from OSF as of August 1990 uses 
the vanilla X11R4 Intrinsics where vanilla means with just a few 
patches the file fixosf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MITs patches 
1517  The file fixosf111 distributed with the 111 version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix18 though

	Motif 111 to 113 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
DMOTIFBC 114 and later should work with the vanilla R5 although there are 
some known new geometrymanagement problems

Subject  67  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas

	Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose  a
WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesnt display anything but lets your Xt 
application know when it has been reexposed resized and when it has received
user key and mouse input 
	The best thing to do for other widget sets  including the Athena set 
 is to create or obtain such a widget this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality   
	At least one version has been posted to compsourcesx name 
	The publiclyavailable programs xball and xpic include other versions

includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for

Subject  75  Where can I get an X terminal server for my lowend Sun 350

	Seth Robertson sethctrcolumbiaedu has written Xkernel the current
version 14 as of 891 20 expected RSN is on solctrcolumbiaedu

terminal most of the overhead of the operating system is sidestepped so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making etcinit
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun like this
example script from mouselarrymcrcimmcgillEDU
