Subject Re Honors Degrees Do they mean anything

   In my opinion a programming degree is still worth having

 Yes but a CS degree is not a programming degree Does anybody know of
a computing course where programming is taught  Computer Science is
a branch of maths or the course I did was
 Ive also done a Software Engineering course  much more practical and likely
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think
they want but also did not teach programming The ability to program was
an entry requirement

Try the MSc Computing Science course at the REAL Newcastle University
Its a conversion course but at least they teach REAL programming

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL Simula Prolog Miranda
Also some basic low level stuff 68000 was covered as well

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems some software
engineering plus quite a few optional units including database theory
and some stuff about comms   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by CC I think next year  I learnt this and 
X Windows programming as well
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months  depending
on your tastes the selection of skills learnt can be quite wide reaching

The one critiscism I would level at the course which I would have thought
invaluable is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry 
this would probably need a slightly longer project period say six months but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course

Yes I know this sounds like a plug for the course why not
