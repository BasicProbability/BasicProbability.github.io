Theres a bug in SunOS 413 which is alluded to in the FAQ although
there its talking about X11R4 as being affected  You need to force
libXmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works
around the linker error  The simplest thing to do is edit each of
the Makefiles where theres a failure and change the line which reads
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC lXmu
to
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic

No This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3x as shipped with SunOS
It is not relevant for MIT R5 MIT R5 should compile without problems

I dont know how many hours youve spent on this but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CDROM to its members The 19921 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for 50  Ive tagged a

SUG CD 19921 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM priced at 50 to SUG
members including a caddy

SUGs emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and valueadded to our members  Last year the SUG 1991 disk
contained plugandplay X11R4 20MB of additional essential binaries
almost 200MB of Sun patches fullyindexed archives of Sunrelated net
postings priced at only 250

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively but to continue to supply as much valueadded
as possible  To accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk
set the first containing whats ready and needed now the second
available later in 92 containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks

The SUG 19921 disk which was assembled by Robert A Bruce contains
a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member for 50 per
disk including one of those hardtofind caddies  If you are not a
SUG member you can become one for an additional 40 if you live
within the US or 55 outside

The SUG 19921 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk which means it can be used
by PC Macintosh and other workstations as well and contains a
total of 543MB of material including

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES for SPARC as of several weeks after
the initial distribution thus four fixes and the the MIT contrib0
distribution are included 109MB of material  Binaries for X Xsun
