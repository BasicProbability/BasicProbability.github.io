Subject problem with Tek xterminal


We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal and Im having
a problem with it We have a graphics widget that we wrote to
display waveforms and it doesnt work on the xterminal the buttons
etc all show up and it seems to take the right amount of time to
draw but nothing is visible in the graphics window I
have no clue as to where to start looking the program works fine
on all our suns 3s and 4s color and BW could anyone suggest a
line of attack for this problem

TekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 600 host is a Sun IPX
running SunOS 413 and X11R5 PL17
