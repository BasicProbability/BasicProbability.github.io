Subject String to Widget Resource Converter

Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function XmuCvtStringToWidget I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm ie

MyProggyMyListSWtopWidget               MainTextSW

However when I run the program I get the message

Warning No type converter registered for String to Window conversion

Just like the manual sez

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs  
        
            XtWidgetBaseOffset
            XtPointerXtOffsetOf CoreRec coreparent 
            sizeofCoreWidget
        
    

    XtSetTypeConverter XtRString XtRWidget XmuCvtStringToWidget
                            parentCvtArgs XtNumberparentCvtArgs XtCacheAll                                NULL 


However I havent got a clue where to put it The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widgets classintialize function HOW Whats
one of those 

If anybody has any code to do this please let me know the trick  Im sure
this is a FAQ

Thanks in advance

    these or Coreh and Intrinsicsh OK I know RTFM
