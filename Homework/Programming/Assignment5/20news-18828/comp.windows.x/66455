Subject Problem with MITSHM

I am trying to write an image display program that uses
the MIT shared memory extension  The shared memory segment
gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem
But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage
with the following message

X Error of failed request  BadShmSeg invalid shared segment parameter
  Major opcode of failed request  133 MITSHM
  Minor opcode of failed request  3 XShmPutImage
  Segment id in failed request 0x0
  Serial number of failed request  741
  Current serial number in output stream  742

Like I said I did error checking on all the calls to shmget
and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory
segment as well as checking XShmAttach  There are no
problems

If anybody has had the same problem or has used MITSHM without
having the same problem please let me know

By the way I am running OpenWindows 30 on a Sun Sparc2

Thanks in advance
John C
