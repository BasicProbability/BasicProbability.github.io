Subject Books on ICC other than ICCM

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on interclient communications
BESIDES ICCM

Ive looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how  OReilly has no examples ICCM has no examples
Asente  Swick give no examples  in fact most of the books Ive looked at
if they discuss ICC at all simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Youngs book and five hours after I bought Youngs book I had
my applications talking to each other

I am not sure however if thats the best way  Id like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes andor sockets probably arent the way to go  But within X
one can also use messages the clipboard and perhaps window groups

I need a text that discusses the various methods discusses which method is best
for which purpose and gives examples  Without examples its all just words

Thanks in advance

Ross
