Does anyone have any good ideas on how to integrate C code elegantly
with TeleUse UIMX  Interface Architect generated code

Source would be great but any suggestions are welcome


Alsys has produced a paper outlining how to use C with TeleUSE  You can
get a copy from your local sales rep or call us at 6194572700

As mentioned it is very straight forward using the Dialog language
similar to Visual Basic
