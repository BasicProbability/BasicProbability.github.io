Subject widgets vs gadgets



 Ive been using the XmGraph widget thats been floating around and I
 noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets perhaps
 even 100 faster  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
 were no longer any benefit to performance and that its just as well
 to use widgets everywhere 

Interesting Id like to know why

But try it again on a single ethernet with 100 X terminals on it
and I think youll find it much slower
