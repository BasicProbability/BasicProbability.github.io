Subject Help SunView on olwmxview3X11R5


Hi

I just compiled the X11R5 distribution for a Sun3SunOS411  I also
compiled the public domain xview3 with olwm distribution  I have some
old 3rdparty application binaries that are SunView programs  How do I
get them to work under xview3 and olwm  I tried using the OpenWindows
version 2 svenv program but it did not work

I do not have news accessthats why I am mailing this directly  Also
is there an email alias where my questions can get to compwindowsx or
compwindowsopenlook  PLEASE RESPOND TO fwr8bvfinafmil

Thanks
Shash
