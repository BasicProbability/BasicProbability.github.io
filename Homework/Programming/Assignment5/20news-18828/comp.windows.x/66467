Subject Re I need source for splines

 In the Xlib Programming Manual ORielly Associates it is pointed out
 that routines for drawing splines is not included in Xlib but extensions
 are publicly available  I need spline routines which work within the X
 environment
 
 I have previously posted a similar request and got two responses both
 directing me to the Interviews package at interviewsstanfordedu  I
 got it but it is too much  It looks like too much work to try to
 identify extract and modify relevant components  I am looking for
 code that is not encumbered by a complex and extensive framework which
 is beyond our needs  We just need the spline extensions to the Xlib

Look in xfig  It has two types of spline algorithms and is relatively simple
Xfig is available from exportlcsmitedu in
