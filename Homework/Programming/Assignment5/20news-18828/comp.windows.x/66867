   Can somebody point me to source code for dumping the contents of
   an Xwindow into a color postscript file  I have written
   an app which brings up an Xwindow and I want at the click
   of the mouse to dump the window into a postscript file
 
 
 
  I use xwd and xwd2ps To do it from within a program I use
  xwd id xxxxx where xxxxx is the window id obtained from XtWindowwidget
 
     He asked for sources
 
     The   portable    bitmap    tools    from    Jef    Poskanzer
     jefwellsfcaus  include  filters  to  do  that and much
     more
 

BTW the X11 tools come as sources The sillyness of most vendors lets you
stuck with binaries

Anyway have a look onto xgrabxgrabsc It does the IMHO best job for
this including compression
