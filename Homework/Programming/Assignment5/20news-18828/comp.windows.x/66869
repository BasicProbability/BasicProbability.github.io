Subject Re appdefaults files

Hello

   When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
cannot load appdefaults file check your XAPPLRESDIR
environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory 
 this is the appdefaults file for BX  in the directory
specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable

   If you dont have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable
then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the
BuilderXcessory file is You can do this using the setenv
command under csh Note that the name ends in ad so you will
have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to BXNad to get the
appdefaults to load correctly

   To make sure the the appdefaults file can be read by all
the users make sure that a copy of or a link to the appdefaults
file exists in usrlibX11appdefaults or 
usropenwinlibappdefaults depending on how your system is
set up

   Once you have taken care of this set the systemDirectory
resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX 
For example lets say Ive installed BX in t then my system
directory resource should be set like this 

systemDirectory tbuilderXcessory

    Thanks
