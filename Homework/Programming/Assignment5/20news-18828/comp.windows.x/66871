     If you
     look closely at Motif you will see that it is just MSWindows
     with more eyepleasing color and texture  The only real difference
     is that an MS application window can contain other toplevel children 
     while a Motif application window launches its children out onto the
     desktop
 
   aab To those of you familiar with both GUIs is this correct My experience
   aab with X makes me think that this MSW behavior is easily duplicated
   aab with X11 But I dont know MSW
 
 Another important difference is that MSW doesnt have any window that
 handle sophisticated geometry management like XmForm Also I believe
 that in Windows 3x youre limited to 64K of resources windows menus
 icons etc

IMHO this whole discussion named Motif looks like MSWindogs is totally
stupid The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window
Manager that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the MSW windowmanaging agent however its name is
But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif in fact MWM and Motif can work
without each other and if one doesnt like MWMs outfit for some reason
he switches to another windowmanager All this doesnt influence Motif
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications and this toolkit
is IMHO uncomparable to MSW because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the MSW interface

You cannot say A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer ONLY because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position Motif and MSW are complete
different worlds only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as MSW
