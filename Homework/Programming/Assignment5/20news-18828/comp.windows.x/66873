Subject GUI Study  do users want to build solutions



   let me point out that both GUIbased wordprocessors and textbased
   formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse and
   actionbased and the other symbolbased

True but thats beside the point This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing not about what they actually are doing
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer
of the system NB some users may see it too but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer

Im not saying that the programmers perspective is evil or stunted After
all thats what I do too I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the userprogrammer conceptual models and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system 


   I dont recall the actual stats but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a symbol manipulator

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim At any rate I dont think this is evidence that 20 of users think
like programmers Bankers financial analysts structural engineers 
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation But what they do is not programming and programming is not
required to do what they do 

To restate my previous point yes users want to build their own solutions
no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this
