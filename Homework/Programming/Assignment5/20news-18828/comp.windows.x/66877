I am trying to run xwd on a Sun SPARCstation IPX
with SunOS 412 and Openwindows 30 I am using
the Motif window manager I have been unsuccessful
in using xwd under Motif I get the following when
doing xwd out xwddmp

X Error of failed request  BadDrawable invalid Pixmap or Window parameter
  Major opcode of failed request  73 XGetImage
  Resource id in failed request  0x500043
  Serial number of failed request  213
