I am trying to figure out the current C toolkit directions
More simply Id like to know which C toolkit to bet on 
for use in a new long term project

I have the same problem  I have looked at Motif WWL InterViews GINA
and a few variations on the above  Ive also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Waves Viewh  I like Viewhs abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned but the resulting code looks little like Motif and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code  GINA allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance
but the resulting code is almost too Motiflike and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code  InterViews looks
promising but I havent found a free version with Motif support and Im
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted
and what if any specific Motif support will be available over time  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motiflike but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C to simplify my coding task

At this point my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C and invoke those routines from my C code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task  Later if OSF or some credible standardssetting body
comes up with a C interface to Motif I will change to that  It does me
no goo to write in C if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions  Its better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now  Viewsh is the only
library Id consider right now but in our environment wed end up spending
nearly 5000 to use it and I cant justify it when its likely to cause
shortterm productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently longlived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve
