Subject Fresco status

Ive been hearing rumblings about Fresco and it sounds like it may be
what Im looking for but how far is it from release or at least some kind
of availability  How similar is it to InterViews  If I code to InterViews
will my code work with Fresco  How about Motif  Ive heard some mention
of versions of InterViews which support Motif  Will it be feasible to use
Motif with Fresco

Any information would be much appreciated
