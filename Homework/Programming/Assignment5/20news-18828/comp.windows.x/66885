Subject compiling clients on a Sun IPX

Im trying to set up an IPX for another group I copied all the
X stuff that I compiled on my 4280 which runs SunOS 411 using
gcc 21 and most things run just fine however I did find a
couple of bugs and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX
which runs 413 I get

ld Undefined symbol
   XShapeQueryExtension
   XShapeCombineMask

I know that I can include libXext and get rid of those messages
but I cant figure out why I get them on the IPX and not on the
4280 any ideas
