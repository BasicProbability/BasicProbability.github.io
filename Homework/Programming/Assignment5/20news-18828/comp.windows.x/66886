Subject Re Motif vs Athena etc

My impression is that most people use Motif because their OS vendor
supplies it with X SunOS users excluded and because it is similar in
look and feel to MSWindows and OS2 PM  Personally I also prefer
the look and feel of Motif no flames please  just an opinion

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun IBM HP  cant remeber the
other members in the recent announcement Im sure youll see it on
virtually every workstation ie Sun IBM HP and DEC must make up the
VAST majority of all hardware


I am also concerned by this prevalence of Motif particularly from the
point of view of writing and obtaining free software  As the Linux and
386BSD communities grow however I think that Motif will lose some of
its grip at least in the noncommercial marketplace  


Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
100  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
pertaining to Motif has been high


I just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial
and noncommercial software ie you will only get free software using
Athena or OpenLook widget sets and only get commercial software using
the Motif widget sets  


I cant see why  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
by default and you can buy it for under 100 for the free UNIX
platforms I cant see this causing major problems


Side Note 

All the X based code I am writing and will distribute freely when
completed is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also look
and feel point of view I like it the best no flames on this one
please
