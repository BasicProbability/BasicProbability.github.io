Subject Xserver multi screen

Hi Xperts some simple questions for you

Ive seen a lot of different terms which seem to mean the same thing
Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean

	 multiscreen
	 multiheaded
	 multidisplay
	 XServer zaphod mode

Is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle
in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12 

How is the capability called if I want to move the cursor from one
screendisplay to another

Any hints welcome

Thanks rainer
