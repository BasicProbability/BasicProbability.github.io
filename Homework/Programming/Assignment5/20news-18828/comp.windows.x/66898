Subject Available memory to the Xserver How to get the actual size

Hello Everybody

I have a little question

Due to more features PEX DragDrop many applications when linked with for
example Motif 12 instead Motif 11 need more memory in the Xserver
Xterminals only have limited memory normally no swapping possible So my
question

Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free
memory available to the Xserver

So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the
CSS on client side or on server side when there is enough memory

Please reply via email Ill summarize

Sincerly
