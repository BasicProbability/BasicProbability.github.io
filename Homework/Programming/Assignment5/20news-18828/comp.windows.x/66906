Subject Delayed Expose Events


I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
able to help me

The problem is that mainwinwin is doing fine but when I create
detailwinwin it does not receive its initial expose events until
mainwinwin receives an event Here are the relevent calls

mainwinwin  XCreateSimpleWindow mydisplay DefaultRootWindowmydisplay
                myhintx myhinty myhintwidth myhintheight
                mainwinlinethick fg bg
XSetStandardPropertiesmydisplay mainwinwin mainwintext
                mainwintext None argv argc myhint
mainwingc  XCreateGC mydisplay mainwinwin 0 0
XMapRaised mydisplay detailwinwin
XMapSubwindows mydisplay mainwinwin
The event mask for mainwin is
        PPosition  PSize  StructureNotifyMask  ExposureMask KeyPressMask 
        EnterWindowMask  LeaveWindowMask
The flags are
        PPosition  PSize

I then create detailwinwin with the following calls hints has new values
detailwinwin  XCreateSimpleWindow mydisplay DefaultRootWindowmydisplay
                myhintx myhinty myhintwidth myhintheight
                detailwinlinethick fg bg
XSetStandardPropertiesmydisplay mainwinwin detailwintext
                detailwintext None argv argc myhint
detailwingc  XCreateGC mydisplay detailwinwin 0 0
XMapRaised mydisplay detailwinwin
Event Mask and flags are identical to mainwins flags and event mask
 
If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detailwinwin
are not received until mainwinwin receives an event Id love to hear
from them Other that that everything works great so there must be some
detail Im overseeing

Thanks for any tips
