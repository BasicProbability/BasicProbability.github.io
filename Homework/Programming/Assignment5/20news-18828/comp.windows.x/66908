Subject  CURSOR SIZE PROBLEMS 

 Apologies for those who have read this before but noone has solved this 
 one yet so Im posting again Sorry                                   

Im having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64 Im using Motif 11
X11R4 running HPUX 807  all the functions return valid results but no
cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size I tried

using the following code

unsigned int wh
XQueryBestCursorXtDisplayprogramArea XtWindowprogramArea 72 71 w
h

to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as
the width and height respectively What am I doing wrong and if not how can I
get round the problem

Thanks in advance
Mike
