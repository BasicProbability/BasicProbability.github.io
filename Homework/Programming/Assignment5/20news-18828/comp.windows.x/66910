Subject MacX 12 color problem

I have a peculiar color problem with MacX Apples Macintosh X server
Id like to know if others have seen the same problem Its happened
with the current version 12 and with version 117
When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows
are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server
to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors It doesnt happen
for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients
