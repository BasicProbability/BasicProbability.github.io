Subject need help with Athena Text Widget

I want to create a singleline Text widget for entering a small amount of text

I want it to be of fixed width but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
visible

In trying to do this I have two problems

  The addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
   taller but instead it seems to cover part of the text

  The scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
   in order to keep the insertion point visible

Any help is appreciated

Mike
