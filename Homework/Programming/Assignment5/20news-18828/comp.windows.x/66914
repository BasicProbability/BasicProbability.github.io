 Ive got a problem concerning the maximum size of X pixmaps in DECwindows
 
 I am using a DECstation 5000200 running ULTRIX V42 Rev 96 System 2
 and UWS V42 Rev 272 DECwindows Our color display has 1280x1024
 pixels
 
 
 On other hardware HP SGI I am able to allocate much larger pixmaps
 
 Did anyone have similar problems before or does onyone know how I can
 configre my system to allow for larger pixmaps
 
 Any suggestins are welcome Please send mail to  haaseigdfhgde 
 

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers known as 3D accelerators
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle thus they set this limit
