  Apologies for those who have read this before but noone has solved
this 
  one yet so Im posting again Sorry                             
     
 
 Im having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64 Im using Motif 11
 X11R4 running HPUX 807  all the functions return valid results but no
 cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size
I tried
 
 using the following code
 
 unsigned int wh
 XQueryBestCursorXtDisplayprogramArea XtWindowprogramArea 72 71 w
 h
 
 to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as
 the width and height respectively What am I doing wrong and if not
how can I
 get round the problem

Does the workstation youre using have hardware cursor support  Or does
the server generate a software cursor  You can generally tell the difference
just by using it  If the cursor blinks a lot when theres screen activity
its probably a software cursor  If it has a hardware cursor I think youre
probably battling a bug in HPs X server  Im not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64  Its quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just 
that

In reality youre probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns
