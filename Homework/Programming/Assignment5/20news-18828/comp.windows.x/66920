Subject Why do I need xrdb m when Xdefaults unchanged

Im having an X resource problem using Brian Wilsons wscrawl 20
a wonderful interactive conferencing program by the way  Im 
running OpenWindows 30 on a SPARC 1 under OS 413  I have
the following defaults in my Xdefaults file among many others
  wscrawltelePointerName	Kevin
  wscrawlsyncScrollbars		True
  wscrawlcontinuousTelePointer	True
  wscrawlshowPointerCoordinates	False
  wscrawlbackground		LightBlue
  wscrawlswindowforeground	yellow
  wscrawldrawareaframeforeground	Blue
  wscrawlkeyboardFocusPolicy	pointer

Naturally I exited the server and restarted it after adding
those lines to Xdefaults 

If I run the following from a cmdtool pwd  my home dir
  xrdb m Xdefaults
and then start up wscrawl then all those defaults are used
properly  Wonderful yes  Except that I cant get them to be
operative except by manually invoking the aforementioned
xrdb command  If I try
  xrdb Xdefaults
the defaults wont take

So I tried to change the xrdb call in my xinitrc file from
  xrdb  HOMEXdefaults
to
  xrdb m HOMEXdefaults

No go  So I tried adding in
  xrdb m homekbwXdefaults
at the beginning or end of my openwininit file  Still no go

Any notions what gives  Thanks for the help
