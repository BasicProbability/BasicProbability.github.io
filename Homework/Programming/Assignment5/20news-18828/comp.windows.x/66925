Subject Help Event propagation


The following problem is really bugging me
and I would appreciate any help

I create two windows

w1 child to root with eventmask  ButtonPressMaskKeyPressMask
w2 child to w1 with donotpropagatemask  ButtonPressMaskKeyPressMask


Keypress events in w2 are discarded but ButtonPress events fall through
to w1 with subwindow set to w2

FYI Im using xnewsolvwm

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here
