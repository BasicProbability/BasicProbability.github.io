  really involved there Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting
  bleeding edge ie when kernel patches C library or compiler patches come
  out people like to rebuild their entire systems The prime requirement for
  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license
  Hence Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView
  Individuals may write software requiring Motif but I doubt it is widely
  adopted

Shameless plug  the Xaw3d widgets make Athena a much nicer
alternative than the stock MIT Athena code
