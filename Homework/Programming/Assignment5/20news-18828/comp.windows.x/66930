I am trying to use XCopyPlane to copy a single plane 
from a depth8 pixmap to a depth1 pixmap  Everytime I
try this I see absolutely nothing displayed  I know there
is data in the depth8 pixmap becuase I have checked by doing
an XCopyArea to the screen

The code fragment looks reasonable but is your logic valid
Just because something appears in an 8 bit deep pixmap doesnt
mean every bit plane contains data  Did you try each plane
