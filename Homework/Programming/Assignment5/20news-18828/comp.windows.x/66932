Dear Xperts

   Heres my problem  I am designing several related X 
applications each one is a separate executable and  Id like 
to build a single control window that would allow the user to 
access each application instead of having to locate the correct
icon The Control Window would contain a button for each 
application and by pressing it the applications main window
would appear  I would also like to use the applications button
as a color status indicator  Has anyone done this or have any
good ideas  Because these are all separate executables this
seems like a communications nightmare to me but maybe Im
wrong  Id appreciate any ideas Im using X11R5 and Motif 121

Thanks

I can think of two different methods that you could try 1 use fork and 
execv 2 use the system called in your program  Im assuming that youre
running under the Unix OS of course
