I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better
When I set up stuff in my emacs with a keymap and definekeys
I can only access certain of the keys on my XTerminals
keyboard I cant get eg F10 Home End PgUp PgDn they all
seem to have either the same or no keycode I have a feeling
this cant be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some
xmodmap stuff Can someone help me

It is actually worse than you think  I have the same problem and have
given up  Emacs has an internal table somewhere which defines what
keys it will accept and this table is systemdependent  I use a Sun
from my HP and cannot get shift PageUp to work  xmodmap is not
sufficient or at least I havent worked out how to make it work
However I CAN get ordinary PageUp and shift CursorRight to work
and I do some customised things with them

Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem and I am using exactly
the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration
