Subject MIT R5 on Sun with Rasterops TC Colorboard
From markcompvuwacnz Mark Davies


Is it possible to run an MIT R5 based Xserver on a Sun with a Rasterops TC
Colorboard 24bit board  I have the Xsun24 patches for supporting suns
24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else  I know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an IPX

cheers
mark
