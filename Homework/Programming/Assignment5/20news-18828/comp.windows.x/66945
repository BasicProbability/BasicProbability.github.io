Subject Ideal Operating System Was DEATH BLOW TO UNIX

GDay

Windows NT is a step forward but not by much I guess for DOS users who
think multitasking is really neat add puke here and are overjoyed to 
be able to use more than 64K of memory its a major improvement For Windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for 
granted Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 
3rdparty applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
a real issue My ideal operating system

	Binary compatible across all plaforms It should recognize
	binaries and configure on the fly so I dont have to have
	binMac binDOS binDec binSun binHP etc

	MultiCPU So I can use the CPUs on my PC and WS and Mac 
	and Transputers and DSPs I dont know a single site which 
	has gone for a single vendor I am not going to tradein 
	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultrafast FFT on DSP chips
	Note NT runs on Symmetric multiCPU systems

	Builtin portable GUIGraphics tools You can call DrawButton 
	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
	or display It should also translate graphics commands onthefly
	so I can use PC graphics SW on my workstation and X software on 
 	my PC I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential

	Configurable frontend So you can make it look like Unix or DOS
	or NT or OS2 and run shell scripts or commandBAT files

	Object oriented So I can program easily under it and not have
	to reinvent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
	or my application needs to access sourceobject code on the fly

In other words it should have some AI capability That and a tight clean
kernel so you can actually understand it Anyone know of something like this 

	adios
