   	   Ive been trying to compile X11R5 patchlevel 23 on a Sun Sparc
      IPX using SunOS413 and gcc 233
   
   	   The problem occurs during the initial make World  When
      it gets up to compiling the standard X clients it cant seem to find
      some of the libraries  Right now we highly suspect the program ld
      which was updated for 413
   

    Yip we had the same problem the only fix we found was to link static
some of the clients  btw we used cc
