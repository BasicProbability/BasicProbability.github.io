 Ive seen a lot of different terms which seem to mean the same
 thing  Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean

 	 multiscreen
 	 multiheaded
 	 multidisplay
 	 XServer zaphod mode

As applied to servers the first three are fuzzy terms  multiheaded
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors sometimes even
multiple screens even if theyre multiplexed onto the same monitor eg
a Sun with a cg4 display  multiscreen and multidisplay would
if taken strictly mean different things but since the strict meaning
of multidisplay would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers when its used it probably refers to the same thing
multiscreen would a system that provides multiple Screens

zaphod is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen

 Is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle
 in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12 

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such on a TCPbased system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine but this is not a limitation
inherent to X

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation probably the MIT one  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X the author of the article had no business writing
about X
