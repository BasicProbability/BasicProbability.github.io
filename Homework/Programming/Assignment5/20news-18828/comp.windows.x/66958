Subject Searching for xgolf

I recently found the file xgolf on a German ftp site
reseqregentetechniktumuenchende but unfortunately the shar file
was incomplete and the authors email address given in the readme file
markhsaturneeduedu does not work

Can anyone assist by giving the location of a full version of this or
any other golf game for X game or a way of contacting the author

Please reply by email if you can help
