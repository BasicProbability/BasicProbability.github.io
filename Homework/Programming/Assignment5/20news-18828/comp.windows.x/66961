 I am reposting this because I am not sure my first post ever made it out
 I have built and installed X11R5 on my SPARCstation 2  My aim is to run
 the MIT X server but retain the OpenLook Window Manager  I am sure this
 is not uncommon but I just want to make sure that I change andor delete
 everything that I need to  For instance I can start xdm in rclocal but
 how do I get rid of Xnews
 

  The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes
  or from  exportlcsmitedu  I would suggest building this too rather than
  using the version from OpenWindows It is  olwm  v3


I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead This version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even
on large monitors 

This version is also available at exportlcsmiteducontribolvwm3tarZ
The README file also suggest getting the files in contribxview3

In my case I built the X Server first Xview second then olvwm All of these
were installed into usrX5 Once I verified the server worked correctly
I happily issued rm rf usropenwin

Using gcc 233 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
is for all intents and purposes identical to OpenWindows 30 and that is     
incredibly faster There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work exactly like OpenWindows but not much
