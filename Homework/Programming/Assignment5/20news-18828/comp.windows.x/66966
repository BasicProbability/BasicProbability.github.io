Subject compiling on sun4411

Hi
    I have a piece of X code that compiles fine on pmaxul4 pmaxmach as
well as sun4mach but whenever it compiles on sun4411 it gives me 
undefined ld errors
sin
cos
pow
floor
getwmShellWidgetClass
getapplicationShellWidgetClass

The following libraries that I linked it to are
lXaw lXmu lXt lXext lX11

The makefile is generated off an imake template
Can anyone give me pointers as to what Im missing out to compile on
a sun4411

Thanx
Wilson
