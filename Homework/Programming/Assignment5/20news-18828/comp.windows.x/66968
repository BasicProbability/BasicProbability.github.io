 The title line says it The Galaxy package was just recently announced and
 includes a GUIbuilder and portable toolkit Im interested in any
 feedback from those who may have used it thus far

Weve been using it for a year on Unix Sun and HP and Windows platforms  In my
opinion it is the best toolkit on the market  It supports a rich API to a high
level IPC mechanism file system abstraction memory management command driven
application development drawing geometry management and oh yeah Open Look
Motif MSWindows and Mac at the flip of a switch

 
 Thanks
