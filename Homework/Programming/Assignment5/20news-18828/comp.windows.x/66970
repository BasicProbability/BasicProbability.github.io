Subject Re Trouble compiling X11R5 on SunOS413

   	   The problem occurs during the initial make World  When
      it gets up to compiling the standard X clients it cant seem to find
      some of the libraries  Right now we highly suspect the program ld
      which was updated for 413
   

    Yip we had the same problem the only fix we found was to link static
some of the clients  btw we used cc 

Or use a SunOS 411 ld
