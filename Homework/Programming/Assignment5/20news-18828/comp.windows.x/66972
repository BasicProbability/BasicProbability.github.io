   	   The problem occurs during the initial make World  When
      it gets up to compiling the standard X clients it cant seem to find
      some of the libraries  Right now we highly suspect the program ld
      which was updated for 413
   

    Yip we had the same problem the only fix we found was to link static
some of the clients  btw we used cc 

Or use a SunOS 411 ld

Or read fixes 9 10 and 11 to the MIT distribution  This is a known 
problem  just apply those fixes and set SunPost411FCSLd to YES and 
OSTeenyVersion in mitconfigsuncf to 3

In fix09
If you are running SunOS 411 and you apply Suns ld patch 1001706
then you will need to edit your sitedef and add this line to the
AfterVendorCF section

define SunPost411FCSLd   YES

In fix10
If you are running SunOS 412 change OSTeenyVersion in mitconfigsuncf to
have a value of 2

In fix11
Brief notes on what this patch fixes

config make on SunOS 412 fails unless tree previously built in
