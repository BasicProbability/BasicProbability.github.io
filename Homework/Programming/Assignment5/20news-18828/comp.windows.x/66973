Hey guys
I work on many stations and would like this name and current logname
to be in a title of Xterm when its open and a machine name only
when its closed In other words I want HOST and LOGNAME to appear
as a title of opened XTerm and HOST when XTerm is closed
How can I do it

Thnsks in advance

Almost all window managers twm mwm olwm and their derivates support
escape sequences for it For your purpose put following into your
login if youre using csh or tcsh for sh you have to modify it

if  term  xterm  then
	echo 2LOGNAMEHOSTG1HOSTG
endif

Note  stands for Esc in vi you can enter it by pressing
CtrlV and the Esc Same for G it means CtrlG In vi
press CtrlV and then CtrlG
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon

BTW you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd

alias cd cd   echo 2LOGNAMEHOST cwdG

greetings
