Ive seen a lot of different terms which seem to mean the same thing
Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean

	 multiscreen
	 multiheaded
	 multidisplay
	 XServer zaphod mode

Is there a limit how many screensdisplays a single server can handle
in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12 

How is the capability called if I want to move the cursor from one
screendisplay to another
 
 As to how many clients may be display on a server I believe the limit
 would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
 server
 

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this

Background first Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun and other vendors VME systems

That said Megatek products support multiscreen andor multidisplay
on a sigle workstation Most of our cards have a keyboardmouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays For example say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis You could
put in six frambuffers allowing a total of six screens in the system
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboardmice allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays You could
have 1 6screen display 3 2screen displays 6 1screen displays
or 1 2screen display and 1 4screen display Basically any
combination

Because of this we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multiscreen and multidisplay They are quite different
in meaning and at least in X have exact definitions

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display As it so happens theres a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported serverincludemisch
MAXSCREENS As released my MIT this is 3 As released by Megatek
this is 12

As such the most screens supported by a single Megatek display ie
X server is 12 If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
Im sorry but clearly as pointed out so well by Mr Neto this is
not the case

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more Of
course I could say Buy all you want well support more
