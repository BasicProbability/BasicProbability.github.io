Subject Compiling help

Id like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS1750 running NEWS 41c  The
X distribution has support for this config and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine  BUT also in the release notes
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers  What am I
supposed to use for my r5 X server then  How can the OS be supported
but not the hardware Is there something in the r4 binaries that can
be used as the r5 server These may seem like silly questions but
Im really confused
