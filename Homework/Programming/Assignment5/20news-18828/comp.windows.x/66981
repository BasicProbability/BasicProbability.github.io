Subject waiting for a specific eventcallback

Hello world

I want to write my Xtapplication code like this


    dosomework
     now I need some user input 
    XmCreateDialog
    waitforuserinputinput
    if input  OK 
       morework
     else 
       otherwork
    


So morework and otherwork are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question

How can I code this in my XtMotifapplication

Thanks very much in advance

Greetings Huub
