I use DESQviewX and I think it is great Where it really shines IMHO is
to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with
the display going to their screens
Youll need to get
DESQviewX v 11
DESQviewX v 11                           275 suggested retail
DESQviewX to Other X Systems v 11        200 suggested retail

You also must be running a supported network FTP softwares PCTCP
Novell Lan workplace for dos Sun Microsystems PCNFS Beame and WHiteside
Wollongong pathway TCPIp or HP Microsoft Lan Manager

if you dont have any of this network stuff Quarterdeck will give you a
copy of Novell TCPIP transprot for dos with the Network manager

You can get more info by sending email to appropriately infoqdeckcom

In my opinion if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc youll want to have a 486 33 with 16 Megs of RAM
Also the Xwindows software in DESQviewX really seems to like an ET 4000
TSENG Labs chipset based graphics card Personally I found that things
ran better with a SCSI drive in the pc than with ESDI drives but that is
my experience only

                                Good Luck and Best Wishes

What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas
