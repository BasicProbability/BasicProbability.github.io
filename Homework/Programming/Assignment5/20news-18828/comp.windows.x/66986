The other scary thing is that I ship libxclso with the 6 functions
in it  how many other libxclso type libraries will be shipped by
other vendors  Should I trademark the name libxcla What if
some clown uses that name and only puts 4 of the troublesome
functions in it

Does USL SVR4 support LDRUNPATH a la Solaris 2
Or an equivalent

If so you can put the library in a package specific lib directory
compile the app with LDRUNPATH defined and all should work

Besides Id say name it libPACKAGExcla if possible
