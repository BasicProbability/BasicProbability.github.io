Subject Icon Animation 


Hi Folks

As part of my selfintroduction to X Ive been trying to do some simple
icon animation sort of like icondoit from mswindows  Changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple  If you have a widget ID you can
just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap or whatever and youre done Alternately
you can set window manager hints  These methods dont seem to work with
icons which your application doesnt specifically own

In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
my icon box so my question is  Given a windowid how do you change the
icon pixure   A working example would be very much appreciated  If it makes
any difference Im using motif 11 on VMS T605KE

Thanks 
Scott
