Subject How do you find a window id given its name


I want to do the equivalent of an xwininfo name via a call or set of calls
in Xlib  I need to map a windows name to its id
Its probably easy but Ive only been programming in X for a little while
Ive looked in the Oreilly books and didnt find it and I also checked the
FAQ and couldnt find it

Email to one of the following addresses and Ill post a response if it
seems reasonable to do so
