Subject Re Circular Motif Widgets


If youre willing to do a little work you can make DrawnButtons do what you
want moreorless One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that
in our internal LYMB system

We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
dial positions from a single set of vectors Each set of vectors is then
drawn into a pixmap Clicking the button advances the knobs state and
changes to the next pixmap in the sequence

Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget but thats normally not a big shortcoming You
can make things look circular enough
