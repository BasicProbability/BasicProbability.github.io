Subject Re Xlib for MSWINDOWS not an XSERVER

Another company Congruent Corporation of New York City has also ported Xlib
Xt and Motif 11 over to MS Windows NT which provides full client development
for X applications in an NT environment

If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows I thought InterViews was
a C toolkit with C classes If that is so how can it be built on Xlib
unless the classes are calling Xlib functions
