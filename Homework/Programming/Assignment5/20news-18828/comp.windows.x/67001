 Hey guys
 I work on many stations and would like this name and current logname
 to be in a title of Xterm when its open and a machine name only
 when its closed In other words I want HOST and LOGNAME to appear
 as a title of opened XTerm and HOST when XTerm is closed
 How can I do it
 
 Almost all window managers twm mwm olwm and their derivates support
 escape sequences for it For your purpose put following into your
 login if youre using csh or tcsh for sh you have to modify it
 
 if  term  xterm  then
 	echo 2LOGNAMEHOSTG1HOSTG
 endif
 

1 This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm
2 This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible are they 
   Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they
   are  I would think they are DCS device control sequence introduced
   but may be a CSI sequence exists too 
   This MUST work on a dxterm VT and ANSI compatible it may not work
   on xterms
