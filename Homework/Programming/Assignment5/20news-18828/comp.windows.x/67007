Subject XTranslateCoord Problem

It seems like XTranslateCoord doesnt work the way I expecting it  Right
after performs a XMoveWindow I want to know the absolute window position
with respect to the root window  To get this info I do a XTranslateCoordinates
but the absx and absy arent right  Does anybody know of a way to find 
out this information

Thanks please email to hstevecarinaunmedu if its possible
