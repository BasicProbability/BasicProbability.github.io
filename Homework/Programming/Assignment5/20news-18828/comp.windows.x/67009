Will there be any support for round or circular widgets in Motifs next
release Id love to have a circular knob widget which could be used
instead of a slider

How much support do you need  I dont think theres anything
that prohibits you from implementing such a widget though you
will have to write your own versions of the functions that draw
the 3D shadow and traversal highlighting
