I use DESQviewX and I think it is great Where it really shines IMHO is
to let unix users log into a pc and run dos and windows applications with
the display going to their screens
Youll need to get
DESQviewX v 11
DESQviewX v 11                           275 suggested retail
DESQviewX to Other X Systems v 11        200 suggested retail

You also must be running a supported network FTP softwares PCTCP
Novell Lan workplace for dos Sun Microsystems PCNFS Beame and WHiteside
Wollongong pathway TCPIp or HP Microsoft Lan Manager

if you dont have any of this network stuff Quarterdeck will give you a
copy of Novell TCPIP transprot for dos with the Network manager

You can get more info by sending email to appropriately infoqdeckcom

technical questions you can write to supportqdeckcom

In my opinion if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc youll want to have a 486 33 with 16 Megs of RAM
Also the Xwindows software in DESQviewX really seems to like an ET 4000
TSENG Labs chipset based graphics card Personally I found that things
ran better with a SCSI drive in the pc than with ESDI drives but that is
my experience only

What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas   

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself To give you a realworld example here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other Its not too much of a load on our
Ethernet with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 2030 people on each
segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have
10 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns
because youre now on effectively a 33 MHz 486 Of course DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have 10 working programs running youll know it

Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run 1520 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth
It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going
to see a slowdown from Xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also
