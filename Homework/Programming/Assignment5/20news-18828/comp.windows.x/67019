Subject Drawing Lines inversexor

Im trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubberband
boxes in MotifX  Im running on an 8bit display for which Ive created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget  a widget in which Im displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage  If doesnt matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed

Currently to draw interactively I begin with

    drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground 
    mydefaultbgcolor is the color index for the background of my image 
   palettecolorsdrawIndexred    palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorred
   palettecolorsdrawIndexgreen  palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorgreen
   palettecolorsdrawIndexblue   palettecolorsmydefaultbgcolorblue
   XStoreColors myDisplay mycmap palettecolorsDrawIndex 1
   XFlush myDisplay

   XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor
   XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex

Then to draw I do

   XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow drawingArea1 gc x1 y1 x2 y2
   XFlush myDisplay

And when Im all done to return things to normal I do

   XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy


What Id like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever Im drawing over  Instead what happens is I get white lines  If
the lines are over a white background  nothing shows up  If the lines are
over a black area  nothing shows up  Its very strange  But the GXxor
function seems right  since if I do a rubberbanding box it erases and
redraws itself correctly ie not disturbing the underlying image

Any suggestions what Im doing wrong
