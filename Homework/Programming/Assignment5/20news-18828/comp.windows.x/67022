Subject Mix GL with X XlibXtmwm


I am developing an X XtXm application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library GL available on our IBM RS6000 SGIs GL i believe

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow

I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen says that the first
time winopen is called it opens a connection to the server   Also most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily   Is this
true

Does PEX graPHIGS have the same functionality of GL


Environment
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 11
     GL is available
     AIX Sys V 32
     IBM RS6000 360


Thanks in advance
