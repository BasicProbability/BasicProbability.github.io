Subject Re MacX 12 color problem

I have a peculiar color problem with MacX Apples Macintosh X server
Id like to know if others have seen the same problem Its happened
with the current version 12 and with version 117
When some types of client windows are displayed parts of the windows
are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly forcing the server
to repaint it it is repainted in the correct colors It doesnt happen
for xterm windows but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and when the new application starts up it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap
It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors  This makes it look
ugly until its window gets priority  Then Macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted but now other applications
are having to make do with its colormap

This is a problem with all color X servers or at least all color Xservers I have
seen when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap
My solution is usually to 1 avoid colormapgreedy apps and 2 display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color if this is an option for the application
