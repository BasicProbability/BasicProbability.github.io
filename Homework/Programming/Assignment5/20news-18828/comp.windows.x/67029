Subject Forcing a window manager to accept specific coordinates for a window


	Hi Im trying to figure out how to make a window manager
place the window where the create window command tells it
regardless of what it may think is right my application has
reason to know better

	I dont want to set the overrideredirect because I do
want all the embellishments that the window manager gives I just
want the wm to accept my choice of location

	Ive tried twm tvtwm and mwm and they are all
uncooperative

	Thanks
	 Ethan
