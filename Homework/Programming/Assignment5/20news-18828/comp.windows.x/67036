Subject Re  xwininfo



 I want to do the equivalent of an xwininfo name via a call or set of calls
 in Xlib  I need to map a windows name to its id
 Its probably easy but Ive only been programming in X for a little while

Do you have the X source code  Simply look in mitclientsxwininfoxwininfoc and you
will find out exactly how to do it
