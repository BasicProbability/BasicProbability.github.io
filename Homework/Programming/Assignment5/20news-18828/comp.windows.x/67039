Subject Mwm titledrag crashes X server SIGPIPE


   Environment
      macharch  sparcsun4  IPX
      OS	 SunOS 413
      X11	 X11R5 patchlevel 22
      Motif	 122

I bring up X server using startx and usrbinX11Xsun The following sequence
of actions crashes the X server SIGPIPE errno32 xinit reports that connexion 
to X server lost

   1 xinit  Xsun
   2 start mwm
   3 start a client with a 100dpi75dpi font
   4 move the window by dragging the title bar

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE One of the two messages is printed

  Connection to X server lost

or
  
  Connection broken errno32

I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself

Next I ran xdm in debug level  5 After the same set of actions xdm reports

  select returns 1
  Server for 0 terminated unexpectedly status 2560


Note
  The problem doesnt occur with other window managers twm or olwm 
  I have not set LDLIBRARYPATH 
  I am not running font server 
  If I start the client with fixed width font I do not see this problem
  My font path
     usrlibX11fontsmiscusrlibX11fontsSpeedousrlibX11fonts75dpiusrlibX11fonts100dpi

   I did mkfontdir in usrlibX11fonts100dpi usrlibX11fonts75dpi
   usrlibX11fontsPEX usrlibX11fontsSpeedo
   and in usrlibX11fontsmisc

  This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines I do not see this 
   problem on IPC workstations

Questions
  What the hell is goin on  
  What does status 2560 mean of the server

Id greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem
