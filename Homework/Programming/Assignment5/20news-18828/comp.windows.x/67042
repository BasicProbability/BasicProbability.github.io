has anybody implements an RPC server in the HP Xwindows In SUN Xview there
is a notifyenablerpcsvc call that automatically executes the rpc processes
when it detects an incoming request I wonder if there is a similar function in
HP Xmotif that perform the same function

Ive been using the xrpc package for about a year now  I believe I got it from
export  

Glad to hear that its working for you

I couldnt find it on export  However Simon Leinen
simonliasun6epflch has added an Imakefile and an Athena
version and made it available for FTP in the file
liasun3epflchpubXcontribxrpctarz  Note the z
suffix youll need GNU gzip  also on liasun3 in pubgnu 
to uncompress it  

If this doesnt work send me a note and Id be happy to mail you
a copy but you probably wont get it until the start of May 
Im on holidays as of tomorrow
