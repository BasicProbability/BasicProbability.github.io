Subject How do I cause a timeout


I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling its
get value function  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am
not using XtAppMainLoop but am dealing with events via sockets  ya ya

Anyway I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widgets will
call their get value callback  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this or any way for that matter let me know  I cannot or I dont think
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I dont have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc XtPointer calldata  

In other words I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself

Any ideas anyone
