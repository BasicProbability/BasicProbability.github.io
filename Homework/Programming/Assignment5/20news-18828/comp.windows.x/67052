Subject XAllocColor fails to return nearest match

posted for a friend

Okay I looked through the FAQs and didnt see this but I know its
come up before

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order
    Try to find an exact match readonly color cell within hardware limits
    Try to allocate a readonly colorcell and set it to match
	and when all else fails 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the readonly colors 
    already allocated in the colormap

This sounds good in theory  It doesnt seem to work this way
though  If there is no exact match already in the colormap and 
no unallocated cells then XAllocColor fails even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already and there are dozens 
of readonly cells already in the colormap

Is this a bug  A feature  A misunderstanding on my part

Any help appreciated
