 Another company Congruent Corporation of New York City has also ported Xlib
 Xt and Motif 11 over to MS Windows NT which provides full client development
 for X applications in an NT environment

Could someone please send me the postal and email address of
Congruent Corporation and any competitors they may have

Thank you
