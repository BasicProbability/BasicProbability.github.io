Subject Problem with libararies 

I have been trying to compile some source code for a mpeg animation viewer for
X Windows I got the code from a ftp site I have modified the Makefile as
they instructed no errors there What happens is that I get the following
message when everything is going to be linked

make fatal error

Does anyone know where these missing functions are located If you do can you
help me with it

I posted before to one of the other Unix groups I tried their suggestions but
always get this error

If you have to know I am using Unix system V The machines here are 486s The
terminals I want to use are separate and just called Xterminals and they seem
dedicated to that Im not sure as to what they really are since it is one of
my first times out with this Xwindows gidget That is first time programming
for it so to speak I use them alot just for the graphics things

If you can help mail me soon

Gerard
