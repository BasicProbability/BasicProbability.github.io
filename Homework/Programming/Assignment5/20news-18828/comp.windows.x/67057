 The application creates window with a button Quit and Press me
 The button Press me pops up a dialog box The strange feature of
 this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
 first time If I try to pop it up a 2nd time 3rd 4th  time 
 it is much slower

The shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its
positioning request  The windowmanager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place

Exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
me all information greatly received
