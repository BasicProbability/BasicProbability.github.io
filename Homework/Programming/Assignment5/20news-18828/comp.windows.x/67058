Subject XDM  DECnet 

Does XDM work with DECnet I have an Ultrix machine running both TCPIP
and DECnet I have a number of Xterminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCPIP and DECnet Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the Xterminals using TCPIP Since XDM is basically just an Xwindows
client shouldnt I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client It is making
TCPIP specific socket calls In this case the answer would be no you can
not run XDM over DECnet Is this right or not Any feedback is appreciated
Thanks
