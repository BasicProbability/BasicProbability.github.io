Subject GCC and Building the HP Widget Set on Linux


I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux SLS Release with kernel 996 and am running into some
problems  Actually it seems that this is more of a GCC question
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS6000
	Basically there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in lets say CompositePh for instance the composite
widgets insertchild procedure is set up with the type 

	typedef void XtWidgetProc Widget

but in several places in the HP source code they reference the
insertchild procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one as the prototype suggests  For example

	superclasscompositeclassinsertchildw args pnumargs

Now GCC chokes on this giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function  So does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing usrincludeX11CompositePh
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions
	Many thanks in advance for any help
