Subject Problem R5 server hangs on Sun3


I recently compiled the X11R5pl22 sources using gcc233 on
a Sun380 Everything seems to work fine Usually But at
seemingly random times the server will just hang I will
click the mouse somewhere never happens while my back is turned
and without warning it will freeze there requiring the server
to be killed Sometimes it will run fine for weeks sometimes
only for minutes

Os 411 frame buffer bw2

Has anyone seen this before any ideas anything at all

thanks
	jeff
