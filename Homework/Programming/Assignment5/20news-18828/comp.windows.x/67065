In article C5K6nyAzJkirkbuozau bambikirkbuozau David J Hughes writes

 Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
 100  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
 redistribute  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
 pertaining to Motif has been high


Ive heard about that Italian guy distributing Motif binaries for 386BSD
but I havent heard of anybody doing the same thing for Linux   and
I do follow the Linux news group pretty closely  So have I missed something  Id LOVE to get hold of Motif libs for Linux for 100
