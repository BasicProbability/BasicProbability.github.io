Subject XDMxsession woes


Ive just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 an SVR4 486 box
running XFree86 12 to my NCD XDisplay  Its pretty much working but
Im encountering a weird error  Im attempting to start an xterm from
my xsession file but nothing happens  Redirecting stderr to a file
using exec 2HOMExerrors in xsession reveals the error message

  xterm Error 14 errno 1 Not owner

Now if I start xterm from the window manager or from the command line
it works fine  And starting other clients like the window manager mwm
and a clock from my xsession also works

Anyone encountered this  Suggestions
