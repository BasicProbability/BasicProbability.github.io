 For some reason the following code causes my X application to beep whenever I
 intercept a keystroke and change its meaning  The intent of this code it to
 allow date fields the following special keys
 
 	Tt	Insert todays date
 		Bump day up by one
 		Bump day down by one
 
 I hardcoded some dates for this example  Perhaps I shouldnt be using an
 XmText field for this
 
  
  
  For some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys
  of Tt are hit  Why  The idea of this code is to interpret these
  keys having the special meaning implied by the code  I would like to get
  rid of the beeping but as far as I can tell Im not doing the beep and 
  am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring
  
  


code deleted

From the XmTextField man page during discussion of resources

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback

You are setting doit to false in the callback and TextField is beeping
as it should  To turn off this behavior set this boolean resource to false
