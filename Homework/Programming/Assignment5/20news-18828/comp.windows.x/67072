Ive had several requests to post any information Ive gathered regarding my
search for ansi mousecolor xterm source

My only response was from Larry W Virden who writes

 the mit x11 r4 and r5 both provide mouse escape sequences now  There
 are several color xterm enhancements on exportlcsmiteducontrib 

Indeed I found colorxtermtarZ in that directory along with lots of other
FUN stuff for X Thanks Larry

I also found it on uunet in pubwindowsysXcontrib for those that can
only do anonuucp like me  But I noticed that the thing is dated 91290
making it over two years old  Is this really the latest version

Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences
as that for VT340 or colour dectermdxterm I thought that was called
colxterm and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or
might be my program going wrong

Im also unsure of what is meant by ansi mouse xterm
