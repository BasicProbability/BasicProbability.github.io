Subject Re Mix GL with X XlibXtmwm

  Yes its possible in fact theres some gl widget code in
usrlppGL somewhere its named Glibc my IBMs down right now
though so I cant find the exact location 

  WARNING this code feels quite bogus It does things like calling
noport before winopen and then extracting an X window id from it
anyway It worked just fine under aix 31 I spent last weekend trying
to port it to 32 gl under 32 doesnt seem to like it and its
turning into a Hard Job

  Check out your info pages it has some pretty good documentation on
whan you can and cant do when mixing gl and X and how to go about
doing so
