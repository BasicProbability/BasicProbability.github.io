Okay I looked through the FAQs and didnt see this but I know its
come up before

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order
    Try to find an exact match readonly color cell within hardware limits
    Try to allocate a readonly colorcell and set it to match
	and when all else fails 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the readonly colors 
    already allocated in the colormap

Where did you hear this  If it is printed in a book somewhere
throw away the book  According to the MIT specs only the first
2 are true
