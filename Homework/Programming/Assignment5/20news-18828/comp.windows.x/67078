I need to write an application which does annotation notes
on existing documents  The annotation could be done several
times by different people  The idea is something like having
several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
so that the user can see through all of them  Ive seen
something like this being done by the oclock client
Could someone please tell me how to do it in Xt
Thank you very much

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension
You can do the same in your widgets  Few current widgets
support SHAPE so youll have to subclass them to add that
functionality
