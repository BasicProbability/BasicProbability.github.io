Subject Re Mix GL with X XlibXtmwm

 I am developing an X XtXm application that will include a graphics window
 of some sort with moving symbols among other things  A pure X application
 could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an 
 XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of
 the Graphics Library GL available on our IBM RS6000 SGIs GL i believe
 
 Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
 Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
 with XOpenWindow

There is a widget already defined for GL  It is the GlxMDraw motif or
GlxDraw athena widget  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window  Look at glxlink
glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man pages

 I have never used GL before but the doc on GL winopen says that the first
 time winopen is called it opens a connection to the server   Also most of
 the GL calls do not require a Display or GC unlike most X calls  From this
 initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily   Is this
 true

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well  OpenGL will be an improvement

 Does PEX graPHIGS have the same functionality of GL

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful but
thats just an opinion  Mileage may vary
