Subject SPARC IPC Sprite goes off screen

Environment
	X11R4
	Motif 114
	Sun IPC 413

Problem
	When mouse is moved across screen horizontally the sprite goes off
	of the edge of the screen and reappears at the other edge
	It appears that the server thinks we are running in multiscreen
	mode the cursor seems to wrap from one side of the screen to
	the other
	As far as we can tell we are not running the server in multiscreen
	mode
