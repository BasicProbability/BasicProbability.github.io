    Actually I must also ask the FAQs 1 most popular reason why graphics
    dont show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
    rectangle
 
 Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
 Xlib graphics  A button widget when pressed will cause a new item
 to be drawn in the Window  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea 
 or equiv directly instead it should register the existence of the new
 item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
 of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
 Window is mapped
 
 The problem of course is that no expose event is generated if the window
 is visible and mapped  Do you know the best way to tickle a window so
 that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item
 
 
 What does this have to do with my original question  I previously
 stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth8 pixmap to the screen
 just to make sure that my image had data and it did  This is NOT
 a problem with expose events it has to do with XCopyPlane not
 working
 
 Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
 XCopyPlane works  This would be very helpful
 
 Thanks

What it has to do with your original question is this many times 
beginning X users heck experienced X users too write small test
programs  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the applications
graphics show up and sometimes they dont  Were just trying to
eliminate all the easy explanations  for why youre not seeing your
graphics 

That being said why dont you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16  1  4  Try 1 11 12  17
to see it you get any output  Since youre dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data its possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane
