Hi
  Environment Sun Sparc 10 SunOs 413  X11R5 path level 23  My X process
is started by xdm

Okay thats good  Im typing this from exactly the same setup
USUNIX layout keyboard  I did install the sunkbd patch though

  i I want to setup the backgroud root window of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc grey is a very boring colour to work on

Make sure youre using ssetroot which comes with tvtwm  When tvtwm
starts up it nukes the existing root window  Use an ssetroot after
tvtwm starts up   You could spawn off a sleep 10 ssetroot 
You can also use VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey

 ii When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters

Did you install the sunkbd patch  Its in the contrib directory on export
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly except the following
The End PageUp PageDown on the 6key cluster arent recognized
Even the compose key works  Though I cant seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed

Anyone have a fix for the last two
