Subject HELP Setting Colormaps on multitoplevel APP


Dear SGI and netter GLX MixedModel experts
I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows and Ive been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests  In some environments
entry level R3000 Indigo w 405 all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps but on others an IRIS 4D 240GTX
also a different entry level Indigo the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when I compile at different times  The most common
problem is that all nontoplevel windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap  My application starts out by creating three toplevel
windows in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap  This is spectacularly aggravating

I would dearly appreciate
  1 an explanation of the standard RIGHT CORRECT way to give a window
  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it

  2 any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
  desired colormaps

By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable

Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been TRYING
to do this  Please please please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing
wronghow to do it right


Yours

Chris Lee


Display dpy   DECLARE SOME DATA 
Colormap popupcmap
XColor mycolor
Window win
XSetWindowAttributes cwa
int nwlist
Window wlist

 NB FOR BREVITY NOT SHOWING ALL CODE LINESJUST A SCHEMATIC 

popupcmapXCreateColormapdpyDefaultRootWindowdpyvisvisualAllocAll

 HERE WE STORE A BUNCH OF COLORS USING
   XStoreColordpypopupcmapmycolor  

cwacolormap  popupcmap
win  XCreateWindowdpy parent x y w h
                    borderWidth visdepth InputOutput visvisual
                    CWColormapCWBorderPixel cwa


 LIST ALL SUB WINDOWS OF mytopwin PARENT OF win INTO wlist
   nwlist IS COUNTER OF ENTRIES IN wlist

   NB wlist is static storage that can be relied on not to go away
       or be corrupted  I thought of that  Does anyone know if
       setting WM properties is by data copy or by reference pointer

       ie is it acceptable to pass data for a Property then free
       the data   
XSetWMColormapWindowsdpymytopwinwlistnwlist

XMapRaisedDisplay0win

 LATER ON WE HANDLE XEvents NORMALLY TYPICAL EVENTLOOP
