Subject XFree86 and Esix 404

Hello Netlanders

       I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod

       My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows

       486DX5025616RAM  running Esix 404 
       Wangtek ATstyle interface 250 M tape drive
       I have loaded the Basic OS which includes nsu and
       inet utilities tcpip
       I ftped the XFree86 X11R5 binaries and installed properly
 
 I can execute startx and run Xwindows with no problems
 However if I try to access the tape drive while in X the
 machine locks up instantly  If I am out of X and access the
 tape the tape drive works fine  Soon as I try to
 startx again the screen changes modes but the grey background
 pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked  I have to login
 from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system

 Ive contacted Esix about this problem  They claim THEIR Xwindow X11R4
 server which I have works with the Wangtek tape drive  They also 
 claim I only need the nsu network system utilities to run X I dont
 need inet tcpip  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get
 XFree86 to work  Im not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
 packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem

 I would like to get both X and my tape drive to coexist on the same
 system  If you can shed any light on the problem it would be appreciated
 
 One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict  If this is true
 what direction should I look to resolve the conflict 

 Thanks
