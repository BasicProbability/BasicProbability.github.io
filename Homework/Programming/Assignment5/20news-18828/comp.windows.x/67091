Subject How can I detect local vs remote DISPLAY settings

I am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a
remote display  A local display being connected to the same system
that the client is executing on  I have access to the display string
but can I tell from the string

If the client is executing on host foo then 0 unix0 foo0
and localhost0 are all local  Under Ultrix I believe that
local0 is also a valid display name a shared memory connection
maybe  Are there other strings that I should check for  Is there a
better way to detect this

Thank you for any help you can give me
