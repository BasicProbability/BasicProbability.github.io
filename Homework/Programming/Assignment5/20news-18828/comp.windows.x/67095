Subject Xterm Problem With Input Focus  Shuffle Up


The situation running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronicsmode Xterm for displaying some graphics  Typing a RET while
the Tektronicsmode Xterm future reference to this will be Tekterm is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm Im basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tekterm stays the highlighted color and that the Tekterm stays on top of
Xterm  If what Im describing isnt input focus let me know  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics but does not move 
the Tekterm to the top  If the Tekterm has been iconized to conserve 
screen space it stays an icon


The desired behavior one of two options  

    1 Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one

    2 Whenever the Tekterm is inactivated it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm

What I think I need a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tekterm will
be at the highest level and a way to iconifyexpand a Xterm and Tekterm
These commands would Id guess need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tekterm

Other information All this is taking place on a VT1300 a DEC dumb 
Xwindows terminal connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif

Thanks for your time  If youve got any words of wisdom other than 
give up  please send email to
