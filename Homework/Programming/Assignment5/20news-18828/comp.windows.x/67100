Subject Re High order bit of a character in xterm 

 
 Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
 I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to
 the final application Any help is greatly appreciated
 

1 You need these resources 
	XTermEightBitInput    true
	XTermEightBitOutput    true

2 In the shell you need to do  
        stty cs8 istrip 


Good luck 
Victor
