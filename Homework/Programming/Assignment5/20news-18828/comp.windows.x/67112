    XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor
    XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex
 
 Then to draw I do
 
    XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow drawingArea1 gc x1 y1 x2 y2
    XFlush myDisplay
 
 And when Im all done to return things to normal I do
 
    XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy
 
 
 What Id like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
 whatever Im drawing over  Instead what happens is I get white lines  If
 the lines are over a white background  nothing shows up  If the lines are
 over a black area  nothing shows up  Its very strange  But the GXxor
 function seems right  since if I do a rubberbanding box it erases and
 redraws itself correctly ie not disturbing the underlying image
 
 Any suggestions what Im doing wrong

   Try change the GXxor to GXequiv  I have to do this for programs that
   are to run on NCD terminals on Sun terminals I have to change it
   back to GXxor
