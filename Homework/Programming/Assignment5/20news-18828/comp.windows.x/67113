Subject CRL Archive Change Announcement

The multilingual archives at The Computing Research Labs New Mexico
State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon  The
archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical
Research

The new ftp address will be clrnmsuedu the current IP address
is 128123112 but may change so use clrnmsuedu whenever
possible

Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crlnmsuedu and
clrnmsuedu  The crlnmsuedu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research

The Arabic Chinese French Italian Indian Japanese Korean
Tibetan and Vietnamese archives will all be moved

We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved

Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crlnmsuedu or clrnmsuedu  It will take a few days to move
everything

If you are not familiar with our multilingual archives we have been
slowly collecting various software fonts and text for different
languages over the past 2 years  Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented  We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multilingual tools

If you have an item to contribute please put it in

clrnmsueduincoming

and send a note to lexicalnmsuedu telling them about your
contribution

If you have any questions or comments please send them to
lexicalnmsuedu
