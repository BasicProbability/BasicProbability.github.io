Subject Re Forcing a window manager to accept specific coordinates for a window


try this after XCreateWindow


include X11Xutilh

Display display
Window window


  XSizeHints xsizehints  XAllocSizeHints 
  xsizehintsflags  USPosition  USSize	 or  PPosition  PSize 
  xsizehintsx  42
  xsizehintsy  42
  xsizehintswidth  100
  xsizehintsheight  100
  XSetWMNormalHints display window xsizehints
  XFree xsizehints


These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
values If you use xsizehintsflags  PPosition  PSize this tells the window
manager that the values are prefered values of the program not the user
I dont know a window manager that doesnt place the window like you prefer if
you specify the position and size like above
