From marktridentdatasysswriedu Mark D Collier

Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing
of XMotif applications I am thinking of a system which I could
program or which could record eventsoutput with our verification
test procedures and then runrerun each time we do regression
testing I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX
projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS
