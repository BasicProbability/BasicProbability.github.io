Subject Function key to text string translation


	I want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an
XmText widget  When I put

	XmTextTranslations augment n
		KeyF1  insertstringHELLO

in my resource file the translation doesnt happen  If I put

	XmTextTranslations KeyF1  insertstringHELLO

in the file I get the text string HELLO when F1 is pressed but no other 
keys work which makes sense since the default translation mode is replace  

	Do I have a syntax problem here or something deeper
