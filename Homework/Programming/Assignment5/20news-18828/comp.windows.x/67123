Subject Re Animation with XPutImage

 Hi Im new to this group so please bear with me
 
 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete Ive
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and Ive found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
 1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
 2 XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
 is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
 a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
 XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now
 
 All help appreciatedthanks
 
 Derek

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmaps using XPutImage  Once this is done the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable

Hope this is helpfull

John
