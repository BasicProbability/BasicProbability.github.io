Subject Calling a library which creates widgets multiple times

A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an X app multiple times  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize should
never be called more than once  This helped  However I am still having
some problems  Below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program  In the actual program I am writing a library callable
from any other program  This means that the first time the lib function is
called it must initialize things and after that it should just use the
old stuff still around because of static variables  In the demo below
main represents the main program calling my library and doit represents
the interface to the library function

include X11Xlibh
include XmXmh
include XmPushBh
include stdioh
include stdlibh

void blaXtAppContext app Widget top

        Widget topone  top		 in real prog these are member vars
        XtAppContext theapp  app	 of a class
        int junk  0
        Display dis  XtOpenDisplaytheapp NULL NULL NULL NULL 0 junk
                                        NULL

        Widget box  XtVaCreateManagedWidgetblaaa xmPushButtonWidgetClass
                        topone
                        XmNheight 50
                        XmNwidth 50
                        NULL

        XtRealizeWidgettopone
        for int i0i25i	 real prog returns when Exit button clicked

                XtDispatchEventevent
        
        XtDestroyWidgetbox
        XtCloseDisplaydis


 SetItUp  should be called once only
void SetItUpXtAppContext app Widget top

        int junk  0
        topXtAppInitialize app test NULL 0 junk NULL
                NULL NULL 0


 doit  some library function callable from the outside
void doit

        static XtAppContext app	 use these every time called
        static Widget top

        static int setup  0

        if setup
        
                SetItUpapp top
                setup  1
        
        blaapp top


 main  program which links to my library
main

        for int i0i20i
        
                doit
                printfsleepingnwidget still on screen at this point
                sleep5
        



The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created
It is still on the screen  unusuable  during the sleep in the main prog
despite the XtDestroyWidget call

Anyone see something Im missing

Thanks very much
