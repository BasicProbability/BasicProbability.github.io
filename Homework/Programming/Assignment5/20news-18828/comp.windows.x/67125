Subject REPOST AcceleratorsTranslations

I posted this a while ago and didnt recieve one reply and now we
have another bug report on the same subject Can anybody help me out

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case  What I want is CtrlO and Ctrlo to both be accelerators on one
menu entry

In ORA Vol 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol 4 this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource  If you go to
Vol 4 it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well For
example the translation

	ShiftKeyq	quit

will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key and the q key

This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to CtrlKeyo should do
what I want but it doesnt it doesnt work if the user presses the
control key the shift key and the o key

Is it possible to supply  1 accelerator for a menu entry Keep in
mind when answering this question that when using Motif you cant use
XtInstallAccelerators

I am using Motif 113 on a DECstation 5000 but I have also tried it
on an HP using Motif 113 and 12
