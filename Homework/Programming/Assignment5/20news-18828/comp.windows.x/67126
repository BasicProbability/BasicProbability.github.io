Im an new to this  Having found some files public to look into I
ftped them to a system I have access to  I then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer a PCbased file system  I access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe  From the PC
file server I pull the files to a disk and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo the SGI is not networked yet  When I try to uncompress
and untar the files they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid
What Im wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files compressed
binaryascii about multiple platforms  My guess is that it is the copy
to a dos disk that is screwing things up  Any help is appreciated
