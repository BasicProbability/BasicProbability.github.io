Anyone know how an application can retrieve the name of the font from
an application given an XFontStruct  
Would XGetFontProperty work if I passed XAFONTNAME 
anyone know details of this  Thanks in advance

Try this

char nameNULL
unsigned long value

ifXGetFontPropertyfont XAFONT value 
    nameXGetAtomNamedpy value

where dpy is your Display connection and font your XFontStruct pointer
