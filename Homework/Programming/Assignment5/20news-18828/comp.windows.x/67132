Subject Re Mix GL with X XlibXtmwm

On 19 Apr 1993 165912 0400 grahamsparc1ottawajadeCOM Jay Graham said

 I am developing an X XtXm application that will include a graphics window
 of some sort with moving symbols among other things  A pure X application
 could be implemented with Motif widgets one of which would be an 
 XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib  But I would like to take advantage of
 the Graphics Library GL available on our IBM RS6000 SGIs GL i believe

 Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program
 Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
 with XOpenWindow

In SGIs distribution with their Indigo line others as well possibly
they include source code for a GL widget that fits on top of Motif and
one thats Xt based as well  You may wish to ask IBM whether they
support this
