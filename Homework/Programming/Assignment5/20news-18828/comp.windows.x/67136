Subject finding out state of state keys eg CapsLock and NumLock

Hi  Ive looked in the FAQ and the OReilly books and was unable to
find an easy means of finding out the state of state keys such as
CapsLock and NumLock  I can certainly track the events inside of my
window and set a boolean there but what if CapsLock is pressed in
another window  I looked at XGrabKey and decided it was definitely
NOT what I wanted to do  I could find no convenience function to tell
me that information

My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock andor NumLock is

An even more pointed question Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard  ie CapsLock is active and the user
presses shifta Id like to get a lowercase a instead of A

Any input is greatly appreciated Please respond via email  I will
repost a summary of my findings

			Thanks Ralph
