Subject Animation with XPutImage

Hi Im new to this group so please bear with me

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete Ive
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
I put together a quick test and Ive found that XPutImage
is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the
Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
2 XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now

All help appreciatedthanks

Derek
