       XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXxor
       XSetForeground myDisplay gc drawIndex
    
    Then to draw I do
    
       XDrawLine myDisplay XtWindow drawingArea1 gc x1 y1 x2 y2
       XFlush myDisplay
    
    And when Im all done to return things to normal I do
    
       XSetFunction myDisplay gc GXcopy
    
    
    What Id like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
    whatever Im drawing over  Instead what happens is I get white lines  If
    the lines are over a white background  nothing shows up  If the lines are
    over a black area  nothing shows up  Its very strange  But the GXxor
    function seems right  since if I do a rubberbanding box it erases and
    redraws itself correctly ie not disturbing the underlying image
    
    Any suggestions what Im doing wrong

      Try change the GXxor to GXequiv  I have to do this for programs that
      are to run on NCD terminals on Sun terminals I have to change it
      back to GXxor

There is a small section in the OReilly Xlib books that describes
the right thing to do  The key is to set the planemask in the
GC to the OR of the foreground and background pixel values
