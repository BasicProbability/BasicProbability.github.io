 Hi Im new to this group so please bear with me
 
 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete Ive
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and Ive found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
 1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
 2 XPutImage is inefficientor both

Using XPutImage your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever clientserver communications
mechanism you are using

Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps
These are maintained by the server so copying them into a window is
much cheaper

Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs or running
in XSynchonize mode
