Subject Xsun not running on SPARCclassic

Ive installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 21 on our SPARCstation LX 
SPARCclassic pool On the LX X11R5 runs fine but on the classics
after giving the command startx Xsun prints the following messages
	WARNING cg3mmap cant map dummy space
	Mapping cg3c No such device or address
and exits

Does anybody know how to fix this problem

Thanks in advance
