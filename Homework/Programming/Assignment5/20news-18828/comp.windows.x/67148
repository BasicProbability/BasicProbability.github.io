 Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing
 of XMotif applications I am thinking of a system which I could
 program or which could record eventsoutput with our verification
 test procedures and then runrerun each time we do regression
 testing I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX
 projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS

A question like this is answered in the FAQ about sharing X windows
One of the answers is XTrap a record and playback extenstion to X  You
can find it at exportlcsmiteducontribXTrapV33X11R5tarZ

Does anyone know of a program which doesnt require an X extension  Most
the the X servers we have at work have vendor extensions which we cant
modify so XTrap doesnt help up  There is X conferencing software at
mit but I dont know how easy it would be to modify it to do record and
playback

Any help would be appreciated
