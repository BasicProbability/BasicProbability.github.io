I  am  having  a  big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 121
the  one  bundled  with  AIX  323e   Its almost the linker is not
working properly with shared libraries

Ive built X11R5 with no problem before  but now its all  headaches
For example the xset client complains that libXmu doesnt have a bunch
of Xt routines and shro is missing or  something  like  that   The
build of libXmu DOES link in libXt  so I am really perplexed  what  is
going on


following up on this the specific error I get is
Could not load program xset 
Symbol XtVaSetValues in libXmulibXmua is undefined
Symbol XtName in libXmulibXmua is undefined
Symbol XtWindowOfObject in libXmulibXmua is undefined
