	Doug I  am  having  a  big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 121
	Doug the  one  bundled  with  AIX  323e   Its almost the linker is not
	Doug working properly with shared libraries

	Doug Ive built X11R5 with no problem before  but now its all  headaches
	Doug For example the xset client complains that libXmu doesnt have a bunch
	Doug of Xt routines and shro is missing or  something  like  that   The
	Doug build of libXmu DOES link in libXt  so I am really perplexed  what  is
	Doug going on


	Doug following up on this the specific error I get is
	Doug Could not load program xset 
	Doug Symbol XtVaSetValues in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtName in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtWindowOfObject in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtGetConstraintResourceList in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtDisplayToApplicationContext in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtAppSetTypeConverter in libXmulibXmua is undefined








	Doug Symbol XtScreenDatabase in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtResolvePathname in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtCvtStringToFont in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtCallConverter in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Symbol XtDisplayStringConversionWarning in libXmulibXmua is undefined
	Doug Could not load library libXmuashro
