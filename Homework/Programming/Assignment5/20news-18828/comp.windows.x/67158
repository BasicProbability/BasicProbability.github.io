Subject Detecting readonly colorcells

again poseted for a friend

Okay I got such great response from my last question thanks everyone 
lets try again

How can I tell if a colorcell is readonly

I want to use any readonly cells that are already in my colormap
once I start running out of allocatable cells using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color

Once I determine if a cell is readonly I assume I can then just request
an XAllocColor with the exact same color specifications and it will 
then be flagged as used by my application so that it doesnt later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as readwrite to another
application

So far the only way Ive figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors once my
colormap is all full up  It should error out if the cell is nonshareable
But life would be much easier if I could just detect the
readonlyshareable stuff directly

Any ideas
