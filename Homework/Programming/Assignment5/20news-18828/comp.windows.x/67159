Can some one please explain to me why the following piece of code
causes twm or tvtwm to dump core 

In particular I am interested in knowing whether this behavior is
caused by a bug in my reasoning or if it is a bug in twm

If anything a client does causes twm to dump core its a bug in twm
Window managers should never ever crash

Would if only it were true 

If only MIT would fix the  twm InstallWindowColormaps crash bug
once and for all then I could say that Ive almost unable to crash either
twm or tvtwm which would be a remarkable feat  and most desirable to
boot  I mean this bug has only been reported oh a zillion times by now 

Now servers on the other hand  want to crash an OpenWindows 30 xnews
server at will  Just do an xbiff xrm XBiffshapeWindow on  Blammo
