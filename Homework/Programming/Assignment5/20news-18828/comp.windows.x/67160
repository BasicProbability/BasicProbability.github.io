  Environment Sun SPARC 10 SunOs 413  X11R5 patch level 23  My X
process is started by xdm

Okay thats good  Im typing this from exactly the same setup
USUNIX layout keyboard  I did install the sunkbd patch though

 ii When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters

Did you install the sunkbd patch  Its in the contrib directory on export
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly except the following
The End PageUp PageDown on the 6key cluster arent recognized
Even the compose key works  Though I cant seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed

Anyone have a fix for the last two

I dont know anything about a sunkbd patch but I use the following
Xmodmap file run from xinitrc via xmodmap HOMEXmodmap of course for
my Type5 UNIX keyboard  Its a bit brute force however
