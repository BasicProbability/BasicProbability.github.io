Subject Re WANTED Info on Dedicated X Server Kernel for Sun3100 Series


 If anyone has any information about the existence or location of a
 dedicated X server kernel for the Sun3 please send email  I am
 trying to put some neglected Sun3s to good use but they dont have
 enough memory for SunOS 411  Thanks in advance for any help

	There is a free program called xkernel which does just that
It is by Seth Robertson sethctrcolumbiaedu  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
 I find them faster than an NCD 15inch blackwhite XTerminal that we
are playing with and a bigger screen to boot  As a matter of fact
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert

 Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftpctrcolumbiaedu
 128596440 in XkernelXkernelshar Xkernel is a symlink to the
 latest version of Xkernel

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 350 but compiling to work for a sun 31xx should be quite easy

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8  I may be able to answer questions feel free
to email me
