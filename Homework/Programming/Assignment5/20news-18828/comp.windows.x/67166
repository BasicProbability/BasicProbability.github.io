Subject Re Animation with XPutImage

In article 4867mlbsemiharriscom jmartinegretimagesRus John Martin writes
 Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
 server resident Pixmaps using XPutImage  Once this is done the original XImages
 can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable
 
 Hope this is helpfull

I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display
rates 20 400x400x8 frames  sec on IPX that I get with Sunview though
its a bit choppy at times Also loading the data making an XImage
then XPuting it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome so the animation is
slower to load than with Sunview Is there a better way to load in the
data

  If you need speed and your client can run on the same host as the X server
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server MITSHM
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS
  A word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory And another word of warning OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server
  I have written an imaging tool using XView for the GUI by the way which
  yields over 10 frames per second for 5125128 bit images running on a Sparc
  IPC half the cpu grunt of an IPX This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations

Shared memory PutImage also mentioned by nkissebedelphibeckmanuiucedu
Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some
documentation Is this method likely to give better results than server
resident pixmaps Id also be interested in looking at the XView code
mentioned above

Thanks for the help so far If I get something decent put together Ill
definitely post it to the Net
