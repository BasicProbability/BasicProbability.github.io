Subject Re Animation with XPutImage

 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete Ive
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and Ive found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
 1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
 2 XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what

The protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory this is the hog The conversions in the XPutImage are
fast

 is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
 a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with

Yes by utilizing the MITSHM extension that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory Fine fast

 XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now
 

No You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps thus moving
them to server memory and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea
BUT be aware this is a major server memory bummer
