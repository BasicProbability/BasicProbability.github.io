Subject PostScript on Xterminal


 I have a problem when Im using PostScript When I am working local
on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good but when I connect
to the SUN from a Xterminal I just get error messages that the
PostScript cannot connect to the newsdisplay

 Why doesnt PostScript work on an Xterminal

 Is there any way to make it work
