Subject Re Image processing Packages under X

Prateek Mishra mishracssunysbedu wrote

 I am looking for a package that implements standard
 image processing functions readingwriting from
 standard formats clipping zoom etc implemented
 under X Both public domain and private packages
 are of interest The particular application area I
 have in mind is medical imaging but a package meant
 for a more general context would be acceptable

 Please reply to me I will summarize on the net if
 there is general interest
