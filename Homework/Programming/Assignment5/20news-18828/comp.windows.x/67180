Subject Need Help with key bindings

I need help binding some value to the HOME and END keys on my keyboard  I have an
rs6000 w aix323ext running X11R5pl19 mit dist  Im using a PC running eXceed
for windows as my xterminal  The HOME and END keys do not send a value and my
application needs them to be defined  I used this in my Xdefaults to define the
keys

varnetVT100Translations override 
    KeyHome string0338 n
    KeyEnd string0337

Then I xterm name varnet  This works perfect however the 7 and the 1 key on my
keypad are also defined as 0338 and 0337

Any ideas  Help please

Thanks
