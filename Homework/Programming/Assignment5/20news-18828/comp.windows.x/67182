Subject Re Animation with XPutImage

In article 17886nraoedu rgoochrpCSIROAU Richard Gooch writes
   The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared
   Memory Extension to X Look in  mitdocextensionsmitshmms
   I found this invaluble Unfortunately there is a bit of work to set up the
   shared memory segments making an XImage from it etc Also there is an
   extension query to determine if the server supports it but you still need to
   test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
   in the kernel I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
   transparent
   As for the XView code well I doubt that would be considered interesting
   The interesting stuff is done in a C object library People interested in this
   code can Email me

Thanks for docs info It turns out that if I leave out colormap updates between
frames and use tvtwm my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
serverresident pixmap method give an astonishing 50 frames per second And
VERY smooth I think Ive found the best solution thanks to the generous help
on this group However I may have colormap questions later
