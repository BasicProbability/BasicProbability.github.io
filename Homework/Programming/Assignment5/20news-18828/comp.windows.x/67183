 Shared memory PutImage also mentioned by nkissebedelphibeckmanuiucedu
 Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some
 documentation Is this method likely to give better results than server
 resident pixmaps Id also be interested in looking at the XView code
 mentioned above

  Theres documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
X11R5 distribution

  Actually I just finished writing a motif animation program
takelotsofimagedataanddisplayitprettydarnfast When using
onserver pixmaps or shared memory I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly  Testing both methods side by side they
were just about equal

  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesnt grow to ridiculous
sizes but pixmaps can work over a network and are removed if your
application dies one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems eg
Ultrix seem to allow only a small number of segments 6 to be
attached to a process at once consequently a redraw becomes
XShmAttachXShmPutImageXShmDetach on Dec systems And Decs 24
bit displays like the ones I tend to use most often dont seem to
support the extension maybe someone compiled them wrong and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash failed mallocs so one has to
use the local unix domain socket which really isnt that bad one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one

  In short allowing all three forms of display within the program is a
Good Thing minus SHM if running over a network and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest

  I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it
