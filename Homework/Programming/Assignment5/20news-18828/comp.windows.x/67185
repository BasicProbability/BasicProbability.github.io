Subject dynamic SqueezeTitle configuration in twm

I consider TWMstyle Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window
manager I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time with no overlap and since two windows arent enough I have
other xterm windows underneath them with exactly the same positioning

In case youre not familiar with Squeezed Titles heres a crude
picture

  Figure 1 
 
                                  
      title A                     title B            title C 
         
        this is the               window B hides window C but 
          body of the             you can still see Cs title  
           window window A       which is squeezed right     
         
 
  Figure 1 

Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack
with easy access and 3 per stack is usually more than I really
need since I also insist on having a virtual WM

The only problem is that the title location is static that is  it
is configured in twmrc and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager Doing so is cumbersome and
timeconsuming

Therefore I have implemented fsqueeze left center right 
functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click
of a button you can change this

    
     title A 
    
       this is the          
         body of the        
          window window A  
    

to this

                   
                    title A 
    
       this is the          
         body of the        
          window window A  
    

 

Okay So far so good Now how the heck do I get them to put this
into the next official twm and the next tvtwm and the next vtwm
and the next ctwm And the next xyztwm that I never heard of

One way would be to post in compwindowsx a description of this
enhancement together with an explanation of why I think it is a
Very Good Thing and hope that someone reads it 

In case it isnt already clear why I think its a Very Good Thing
look back up at Figure 1 and picture window A moved over on top of
windows B and C now window As title hides Window Bs title
but when you hit fsqueezecenter the result is

              
         title B     title A     title C 
        
           this is the body of the window   
           window A which is on top        
        

 

The rest of this posting explains how to implement it based on my
X11R4 copy of vtvwmshar its just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
ExecuteFunction routine in menusc

ifdef SHAPE
	case FSQUEEZELEFT
		static SqueezeInfo leftsqueeze   JLEFT 0 0 
		if DeferExecution context func ScrSelectCursor
		  return TRUE

		tmpwinsqueezeinfo  leftsqueeze
		SetFrameShape tmpwin 
		break
	
	 and similarly for squeezeright  JRIGHT  and
	squeezecenter  JCENTER  
endif

 Of course you also have to define FSQUEEZELEFT in parseh
  and add
     fsqueezeleft FKEYWORD FSQUEEZELEFT 
      and so forth 
to parsec

In order to use these functions add something like the
following to your twmrc file

Button2  m  s  wvdritdoor  fsqueezecenter

 

About a year ago I posted this but our news was broken and I
think it didnt get out

Since then blast has appeared in compsourcesx Volume 19
Issue 41 you could use blast to achieve a similar effect by
chiseling away at an mwmstyle wide title Better to have a
twmstyle window manager I think
