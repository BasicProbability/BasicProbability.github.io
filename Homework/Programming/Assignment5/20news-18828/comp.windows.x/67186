Subject Re Animation with XPutImage

 
 Shared memory PutImage also mentioned by nkissebedelphibeckmanuiucedu
 Nick Kisseberth looks interesting but I need someone to point me to some
 documentation Is this method likely to give better results than server
 resident pixmaps Id also be interested in looking at the XView code
 mentioned above

There is no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display
device can hold pixmaps in offscreen memory and if so how efficiently
the server manages these resources having to deal with limited offscreen
memory is the bane of the server implementors existence  

I have worked with graphics devices where the offscreen memory to 
main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy
rate and with those where the main memory to display is faster than
offscreen to display requires only a write to the framebuffer rather
than a read of the FB followed by a write

If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into
pixmaps in CPU main memory the rates you can get through MITSHM are
likely to be equal maybe a tad slower depending on your OSs implementation
of shared memory to CopyArea from pixmap to window which is also then
just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device

One advanage of MITSHM is that if your images are large you dont end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them

One disadvantage of the MITSHM is that in its sample implementation
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden violent death eg kill  You have to 
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments
