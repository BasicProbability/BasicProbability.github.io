Subject Help on xlib and include files


 Hi Xperts
   I have a Sparc1 with very limited disk space on usr partition
   previously i was able to run all xwindows applications  and then 
   i upgraded my system to sun os 413 and realized that  the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindows My immediate alternative
was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system This resulted in
not loading openwindows As a result of which none of the Xlibraries got loaded

   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and binX11 files 
required for running Xwindows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw
In a desperate effort to regain xwindows i retrieved usrliblibX files from
the tape  usrbinX11  and usrincludeX11  Is this enough for running Xwindows
 
 BUt i did not get usrlibX11fonts  sub directories  these are mainly 100dpi 75dpi
 and misc 

when i run xinit the error message says usrlibX11fonts100dpi etc are not in the
default path But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no
disk space 
Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 15 GB disk and load openwindows  to
just have my xwindows running 

Thanks

Pramod
