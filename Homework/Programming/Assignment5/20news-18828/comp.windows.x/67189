  try this after XCreateWindow
  
  
 
    xsizehintsflags  USPosition  USSize	 or  PPosition  PSize 
    
    XSetWMNormalHints display window xsizehints
    
 
  These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
  are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
  values If you use xsizehintsflags  PPosition  PSize this tells the window
  manager that the values are prefered values of the program not the user
  I dont know a window manager that doesnt place the window like you prefer
  if you specify the position and size like above
 
 Sorry but olwm and tvtwm dont do it They place the title at that position
 and the window at a position below it

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested
is because thats what the ICCCM says they should do

 This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
 configuration and restore is later
 
 Currently my solution is
 
 	XCreateWindow
 	XSetWMProperties
 	XMapWindow
 	XFlush
 	XMoveWindow

This code will almost certainly break  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager  Even if this did work there isnt a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window so you dont know how far to move it  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window
