Subject Re PostScript on Xterminal


 I have a problem when Im using PostScript When I am working local 
 on a SUN SPARCstation IPC the PostScript works good but when I connect
 to the SUN from a Xterminal I just get error messages that the
 PostScript cannot connect to the newsdisplay
  Why doesnt PostScript work on an Xterminal

	Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server  xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality once you add NeWS and
everything else you have a workstation  There are workarounds Ive
heard one involving a perl script  What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS like pageview with programs that
dont like ghostview
	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround I
have no personal experience with it
