Hi
I have a problem when compiled Wcl 202 in SCO ODT 20


        cc c Ox  I Iusrinclude Xt4GetResLc
Xt4GetResLc
Xt4GetResLc47  error C2065 XtConstraintBit  undefined
 Error code 1

Although I follow the instructions in file READMEBUILD to build Wcl in SCO 
platform this problem didnt resolve

So I have some questions related to this matter

  1 Does XtConstraintBit exist in SCO ODT 20  Does XtConstraintBit use
      in X11R3  X11R4 And What release does SCO ODT 20 use X11R3 or X11R4
  2 If not Does someone know how to work around
