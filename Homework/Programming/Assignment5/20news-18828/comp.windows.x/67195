Subject PROBLEM  Running AIX info from a Sun rlogin shell


  When I run our RS6000s info utility through a remote login
  shell rlogin from my Sun Sparc 1 I can no longer type
  lower case in any of infos window prompts

  I thought the prob may have been due to my Sun window mgr 
  Openlook being incompatible with the AIX Motif application
  but I tried it under TVTWM also  Same result
  
  So this is presumably an X11 key definition problem between 
  workstations  but my system admins feign ignorance
  
  What do I need to do the be able to type lower case into 
  this remote AIX motif app from within my local Openlook
  window manager
