 I posted this a while ago and didnt receive one reply and now we
 have another bug report on the same subject Can anybody help me out
 
 The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators
 and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply  Unfortunately
 the specification for XGrabKey doesnt allow AnyModifier to be combined
 with other modifiers which is exactly what would be desired in this case
 Ctrl AnyKeyq
 
 In ORA Vol 6 in the section on accelerators it says For information
 on how to specify translation tables see Vol 4 this is so you
 know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource  If you go to
 Vol 4 it says Likewise if a modifier is specified there is
 nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well For
 example the translation
 	ShiftKeyq	quit
 will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
 the Shift key and the q key
 
 This is true for accelerators and mnemonics which are implemented using
 event handlers instead of grabs its not true for menu accelerators  If
 youre a Motif implementor Id suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
 changed to support the feature I described above  Otherwise change the
 documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the users
 expectations because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
 translations
 
 Is it possible to supply  1 accelerator for a menu entry
 
 If you mean menu accelerator no its not possible  Thats according to
 the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page
 
 Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you
 cant use XtInstallAccelerators
 
 I cant think of a reason why not
 
 How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
 case  What I want is CtrlO and Ctrlo to both be accelerators on one
 menu entry

I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing  If I were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators I would have one
resource called accelerators that took a translation table period
I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed  As soon as the enduser specified
one it would be active and automatically installed

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item Id do something like

	menuItemaccelerators override n
		CtrlKeyM	fire n
		ShiftKeyL	fire n

The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a Ctrl M show up in your menuItem object

Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget youre dealing with  There
has to be some reason

Sorry for the political tone of this message
