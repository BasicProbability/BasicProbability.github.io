 One advanage of MITSHM is that if your images are large you dont end up
 growing the size of the server process to hold them

  Correct Most X servers use a version of  malloc3  which will not return
  memory to the OS ie the X server might  free3  a Pixmap but the heap does
  not shrink

 One disadvantage of the MITSHM is that in its sample implementation
 there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
 if the client dies a sudden violent death eg kill  You have to 
 be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments

  Well part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
  that problem First I create the shared memory segment attach the client
  attach the X server and then remove  the segment If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone
  Now if the client dies thats one attachment gone the OS cleans up for you
  and since the X server notices the client has dies frees up its resources
  including detaching from the segment there goes the last attachment No more
  shared memory segment
  Terrible but it works
