Subject XTERM patches for Alpha OSF 12



Well after massaging the Deccf osfdef cant remember the exact names
from OSF into my normal X11R5 distribution everything compiles and links
fine but xterm doesnt run


Warning Representation size 8 must match superclasss to override background
Warning translation table syntax error Modifier or  expected
Warning  found while parsing pjP
X Error of failed request  BadColor invalid Colormap parameter
  Major opcode of failed request  85 XAllocNamedColor
  Resource id in failed request  0x0
  Serial number of failed request  18
  Current serial number in output stream  18

Other than this all the other core X stuff seems to be working OK  Any
