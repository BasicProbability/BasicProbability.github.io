Subject Text field in dialog widget doesnt get focus

I am using the GLX widget  athena widgets on a mixedmodel
application under 4Dwm but when the dialog gets popped up its
text entry field does not have focus Aimilar code works perfectly if
I use pure X no mixedmodel HEre is the relevant portion of
the code


   int n
   Arg wargs16
   Widget Button PopUpShell Dialog

    initialize TopLevel here 
   
   
   

   n  0
   XtSetArgwargsn XtNlabel Foo n
   Button  XtCreateManagedWidgetFooBtn commandWidgetClass
                                  TopLevel wargs n

   PopUpShell  XtCreatePopupShellPupShell overrideShellWidgetClass
                                   Button NULL 0
   XtAddCallbackPopUpShell XtNcallback MyPopUp XtPointerPopUpShell

   n  0
   XtSetArgwargsn XtNvalue  n
   Dialog  XtCreateManagedWidgetTheDialog dialogWidgetClass
                                  PopUpShell wargs n

   
   
   


void MyPopUpw popupshell calldata
Widget w
Widget popupshell
XtPointer calldata

   XtPopuppopupshell XtGrabExclusive




A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the
application window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated
