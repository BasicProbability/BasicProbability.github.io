I know for a fact that the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS
works  However an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money

When XFree86 20 comes out with support for accelerated chipsets ISA
EISA and VLB will all be supported

The more important question is what chipsets are supported  The bus
is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue
