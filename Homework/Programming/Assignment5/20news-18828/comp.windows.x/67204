Subject Keysym database problems

I am having problems with a  Motif application that when run on another machine
with different X paths etc cant find the XKeysymDB file   This causes a large
warning output

Warning translation table syntax error Unknown keysym name osfActivate
Warning  found while parsing KeyosfActivateManagerParentActivate
Warning translation table syntax error Unknown keysym name osfCancel
Warning  found while parsing KeyosfCancelManagerParentCancel
Warning translation table syntax error Unknown keysym name osfSelect
Warning  found while parsing KeyosfSelectManagerGadgetSelect



etc

as the file is in a different location but Xt seems to only look for it in
the place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on  Is there any
way to read the XKeysymDB manually with an XXt call so that additions to
the XKeysymDB can be distributed with the application   I have used trace1
to find out what was going on but I need a fix so that these translations in
the application can be recognised
