  There is a widget already defined for GL  It is the GlxMDraw motif or
  GlxDraw athena widget  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea except that it
  allows you to use GL calls to render into the window  Look at glxlink
  glxunlink glxgetconfig and glxwinset in the man pages
 
 Where do I get hold of these widgets

They come with every Iris now  Nth also ships it with their latest
version of Nth Portable GL  I just got the update a couple of weeks
ago  I would assume that Silicon Graphics would license the source
to you so that you can include it in your companys GL offering
