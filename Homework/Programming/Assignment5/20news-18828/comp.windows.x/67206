Subject Re Writing a Motif widget

In article C5wApJDD7ibmpcugcouk nicholasibmpcugcouk Nicholas Young writes

   I need probably to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HPUX
   platform Do I need the Motif private header files and source
   or can I make do with the public headers that are provided
   Motif includes Xt in this context

Yes  Youll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal

   One widget is a multicolumn list which lots of people have
   already written I am sure and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class
   Is this more difficult in principle not lines of code

Im not sure what youre asking  You could create something
which is very much like a true multicolumn list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window  This wouldnt
be good for very large lists  but you might consider this
as an alternative

   Alternatively if anyone has a multicolumn list widget they
   could sell me this might save me from having to write one
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 12 already I do not
   yet have the spec

Motif 12 does not have a multicolumn list in it  Have you
looked at commercial sets  There are also some PD 
widget sets  one of these might have a multicolumn list
you could port
