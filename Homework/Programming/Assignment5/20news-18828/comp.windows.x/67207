Subject NumLock masking interference with MetaComposeExtendChar 

 My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
 of CapsLock andor NumLock is

Alright  Ignore this  I have delved a bit deeper XKeyEvent and
found what I was looking for

evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against LockMask is the one
for CapsLock  Unfortunately it appears that the NumLock mask varies
from server to server  How does one tell what mask is numlock and
which are for Meta Mod1Mask Mod2Mask Mod3Mask Mod4Mask Mod5Mask
eg SGIs vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock whereas Solaris
101 OpenWindows 30 has Mod3Mask for NumLock  Is there an
unambiguous means of determining NumLocks mask at runtime for any
given server  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance

			Thanks Ralph
