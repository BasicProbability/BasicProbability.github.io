Subject question on xon in X11R5


Hi folks

Say Im new to R5 and have one quick question

In using xon  xon  machinename    I notice that it
always comes up with a very small window   Im pretty
sure its the default font  My xterms all work normally
Is xon supposed to read your Xresources for a font size 

xrdb q appears to show the right stuff

I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm fn 10x20    etc
and everything is correct  Of course you could always do a 
simple script to do this  but I have a feeling Im missing
something simple here

Comments  suggestions appreciated

Thanks in advance
