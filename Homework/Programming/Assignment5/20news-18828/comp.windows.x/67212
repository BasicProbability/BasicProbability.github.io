Subject XTerminal Config file question

  QUESTION
  What is the EXACT entry parameter and syntax please in the XTerminal
configuration file loaded when the XTerminal boots to add another system 
to the TCPIP access control list   

  BACKGROUND
  I have two unix systems 1 an ATT 3B2 running X11R3 and MITs X11R4 and 
2 a Sun SS10 without any X  
  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD XTerminal at the
same time  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCPIP
Access Control List to off then login to my telnet session Not Great  
  Ive tried to get xhost to work and failed  Either my syntax is wrong
or the X11R3 implementation is bogus  
  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the 
NCD boots  No matter what entry I add or edit the NCD still boots with
the TCPIP Access Control list containing only the 3B2
  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated  Thanks
