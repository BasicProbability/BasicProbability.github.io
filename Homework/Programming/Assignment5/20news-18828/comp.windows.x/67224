Subject X benchmarks


We are in the process of evaluating Xterminals This includes running XRemote
over a serial line
I would like to run some X benchmarks to determine comparative performance
Has anyone written any such benchmarks or know of any useful programs on the
net  I heard of a program called Xstone but I couldnt locate it using
archie

Please reply to afieldenmlsmaattcom as I dont get to read this newsgroup
much
Thanks in advance for any help
