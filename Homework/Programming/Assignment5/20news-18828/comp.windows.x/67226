  My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
  of CapsLock andor NumLock is

 Alright  Ignore this  I have delved a bit deeper XKeyEvent and
 found what I was looking for

 evstate   has a bunch of masks to check against LockMask is the one
 for CapsLock  Unfortunately it appears that the NumLock mask varies
 from server to server  How does one tell what mask is numlock and
 which are for Meta Mod1Mask Mod2Mask Mod3Mask Mod4Mask Mod5Mask
 eg SGIs vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock whereas Solaris
 101 OpenWindows 30 has Mod3Mask for NumLock  Is there an
 unambiguous means of determining NumLocks mask at runtime for any
 given server  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance

Youll have to check the keysyms on each of the keys for each
modifier The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier
you want A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier

I dont know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either ie what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier I suppose first found is as good as any

X doesnt handle locking modifiers that well 

Hope that helps
