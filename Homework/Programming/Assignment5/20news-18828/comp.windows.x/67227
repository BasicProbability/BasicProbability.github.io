Subject motif based graphing package


i am in need of a motifbased graphing package to integrate into a large
software package under development for distribution to universities  it
can be either public domain or commercial although a commercial package
cant have royalties required for binary only distribution  we need 2d
graphing capabilities at a minimum but 3d  would be nice  any info would
be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest

thanks
mitch
