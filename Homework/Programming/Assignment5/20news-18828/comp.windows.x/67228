Hi there

In article 4263hisUUCP you write
From sp1henhjedit Henrik Balthazar Hjort
Subject PostScript on Xterminal


 I have a problem when Im using PostScript When I am working local
on a SUN SPARCstaton IPC the PostScript works good but when I connect
to the SUN from a Xterminal I just get error messages that the
PostScript cannot connect to the newsdisplay

 Why doesnt PostScript work on an Xterminal

 Is there any way to make it work


It might be that the X terminal doesnt support the Postscript
Extensions to X product  I use the dxpsview program on a 
DECstation 5000 to view postscript files but when I moved to an
NCD X terminal I couldnt use it any more  So I ftpd and
compiled GhostScript GNU software  Now we can view postscript
files on our X terminals

Hope this helps

Grant
