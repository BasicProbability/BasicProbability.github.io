   Hi
   
   I use Emacs and I want to customize my keyboard better
   When I set up stuff in my emacs with a keymap and definekeys
   I can only access certain of the keys on my XTerminals
   keyboard I cant get eg F10 Home End PgUp PgDn they all
   seem to have either the same or no keycode I have a feeling
   this cant be fixed in emacs itself but that I need to do some
   xmodmap stuff Can someone help me

Unfortunately the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs  I ran into this problem a while back my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences  for example the sequence ESC  1 B 7 
would indicate that the HOME key was pressed with the shift key
down  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers such
as shiftReturn

If anybody wants these changes theyre welcome to them but youll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file x11termc  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested I can send them the tweaks but I imagine theyve got
bigger fish to fry hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V19  If theres sufficient interest Ill post the mods 
somewhere although this probably isnt the appropriate group for it

Notes 

  This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own X11 window  If you run it in plain old tty mode which 
   includes Xterm windows then its business as usual

  The patches I made were to version 1858 under Sun OS 412
   I also did this a while back under HPUX  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between if sun  endif but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else
