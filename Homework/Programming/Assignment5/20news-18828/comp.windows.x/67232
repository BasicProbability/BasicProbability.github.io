Subject Re Title for XTerm

In a prior article naoumovphysicsuncedu Sergei Naoumov writes

   Hey guys
   I work on many stations and would like this name and current logname
   to be in a title of Xterm when its open and a machine name only
   when its closed In other words I want HOST and LOGNAME to appear
   as a title of opened XTerm and HOST when XTerm is closed
   How can I do it

Apologies if Im answering something already answered in the FAQ
Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately  so I havent
seen the FAQ lately to check


Two ways
 
 1 When you start the xterm you can use command line options
         n ICONNAME           To set the icon label
         T WINDOWTITLE        To set the window title
         title WINDOWTITLE    Equivalent to T WINDOWTITLE

 2 You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly

    The basic escape sequence is
	ESC  P  SOMEARBITARYTEXT BEL

    where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters
    P is an ASCII decimal digit  2 1 or 0 depending
    on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title
    or both and SOMEARBITARYTEXT is your desired label string

    Hence this command will set the window  icon title
         echo 0330YOURTITLEGOESHERE007c 

    To set just the icon title
         echo 0331YOURTITLEGOESHERE007c 

    To set just the window title
         echo 0332YOURTITLEGOESHERE007c 

    Of course you may have to fiddle with exact syntax
    depending on how the echo command works on your system
    and what shell you are using Ive shown SystemV semantics
    under Bourne or Korn shells

    Hint for Sun OS users  use usr5binecho instead of
    binecho or Cshs builtin echo  Otherwise youll have
    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string
    instead of using convenient octal sequences

    If you want your titlebar updated continously say to show
    your current directory hostname or somesuch then youll
    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands
    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
    in the prompt string itself sometimes not
