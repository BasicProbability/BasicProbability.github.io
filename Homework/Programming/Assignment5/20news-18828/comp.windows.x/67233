Subject Re How do I find my AppContext

In a prior article masc0442ucsnewssdsuedu Todd Greene said
 
  Is there an Xt call to give me my application context
  I am fixing up an XMotif program and am trying to use XtAppAddTimeOut
  whose first argument is the appcontext  What call can I use
  to give me this value
 
	XtAppContext XtWidgetToApplicationContextWidget

Of course just using the app context returned from 
XtCreateApplicationContext XtAppInitialize etc is the
best option unless that path is not available
