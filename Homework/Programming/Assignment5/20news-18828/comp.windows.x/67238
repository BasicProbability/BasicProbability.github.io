Subject X11 load on the Network

Can someone point me in the direction of any papers not necessarily
formally conducted studies discussing how much traffic X apps generate
for the network particularly in comparison with cursesbases apps 
over telnet  Also does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard
input a line at a time  Can the X client control this asking for
keystrokes immediately  Thanks in advance for any feedback
