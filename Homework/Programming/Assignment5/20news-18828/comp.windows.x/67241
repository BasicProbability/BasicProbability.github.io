 Do anyone know about any shading program based on Xlib in the public domain
 I need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program
 
 Appreciate the help
 
 
 I dont know if this might help but Ive just started playing with a program
 called POVRay Persistance of Vision Raytracer that also displays its output
 via X Windows  It does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
 PsuedoColor 8plane display  I got the source from from a site in Canda
 The person I retrieved them from was David Buck dbuckccscarletonca
 

I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
fi Gouroudshading of triangles This is fairly complex to do with plain
X Simpler shading models are implemented already fi in x3d ask archie
where to get the latest version
For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only either MITSHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it or PEXOpenGL which should be able to shade themselves The portable
vanilla X way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage
what would be good enough to do static things as fi fractal landscapes
or such stuff

To speak about POVRay the X previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good especially in speed protocolfriendlyness and
ICCCM compliance Have a look on x256q my own preview code It is on

The README states the points where it is better than xwindowc from
