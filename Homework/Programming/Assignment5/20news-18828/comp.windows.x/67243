Subject Is authentication a planned feature for X11R6

Greetings

My question is whether the upcoming release of X11R6 will provide
strong authentication between the X clients and servers If so
will this feature be based on the Kerberos authentication mechanism
and if so will Kerberos Version 5 be used Please reply via email

Thanks

Andre
