Subject X on Amiga 4000

Im new to the hardware and with a mandate to port some Xbased
stereovideo software  does anyone know of or have experience with
X on Amiga machines  If I can retain the X event handling it would
ease my plight considerably and if I can keep all the Motif bits so
much the better
