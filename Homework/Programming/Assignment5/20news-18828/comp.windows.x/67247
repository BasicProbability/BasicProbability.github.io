Subject Overriding window manager focus processing

     I am working on an XWindow based application that needs to 
override some of the window manager focus processing  I am 
using X11R4 and Motif 11 currently although I will also be 
working with Open Look in the future

     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one window of the application to 
another window  Lets say for example that Window A is on top 
of Window B in the window hierarchy  Normally if the user clicks 
the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the 
window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A  Under certain 
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to 
beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window 
A

      From the research and testing Ive done so far it appears that 
this window ordering is handled by the window manager in this 
case Motif  I havent found any way to override this default 
processing through standard X Window functions  I can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
notify events but I cant find any way to tell Motif not to make the 
switch

      The temporary solution Ive currently come up with is very 
kludgy but it partially works  When I detect such a window switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed I manually force 
the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call 
and beep with the XBell function  This provides the necessary 
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
twice

      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif or preferably any 
window manager when I dont want the window order switch to 
actually take place  Respond either by email or posting to this 
newsgroup

Cheers     Randall
