Subject Looking for X Window Server FrequencyofOperations Data

Hello  Im currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
X  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr Fred Brooks at
UNCChapel Hill  While we feel that weve got a pretty solid design
currently wed really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
XWindows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget  

Unfortunately Ive been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various X FAQs or X manuals that Ive seen  Does anyone have some type of
frequency data like how many Copyrectangle operations vs drawlines and
things of that sort  Or barring that a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself

Any and all help would be very appreciated

Many thanks
    Mark
