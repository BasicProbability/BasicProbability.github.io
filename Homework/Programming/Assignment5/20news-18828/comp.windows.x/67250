Subject Re Q Colormaps with dialog shells

 I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
 XCreateColormap and uses all of the colors available for my 8bit
 displayWhen I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
 some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
 XmDIALOGPRIMARYAPPLICATIONMODAL  The result is that if my cursor is
 over the dialogShell I get my colormap but if the cursor is over the
 applicationShell or any window other than the dialogShell I get the
 default colormap  But Id like it so that if my cursor is over any
 window of my application I get my colormap

I think this is correct behavior  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus  Since the dialog is modal mwm wont allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell and so it wont allow cmap focus either

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicypointer I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicypointer also  That way the cmap
focus wont slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path

if you have keyboardFocusPolicy explicit you can set cmap focus
explicit also but you then need a binding to ffocuscolor probably on
