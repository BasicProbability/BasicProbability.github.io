Subject Problems with color Xterm

We have recently obtained a copy of colorxterm from exportlcsmitedu after
seeing it mentioned in a previous article On compilation it reports the
following undefined symbols
	getwmShellWidgetClass
	getapplicationShellWidgetClass

	but still runs When sending escape sequences to set the colour
any colour comes out as black text on a black background Any Ideas

Has anyone used this program in colour successfully

Can anyone point me to any other colour terminal emulators

We are running OpenWindows 3 on Sun Sparcs running SunOS 413
