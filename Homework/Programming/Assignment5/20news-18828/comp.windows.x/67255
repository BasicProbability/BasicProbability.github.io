Subject Pulldown menu periodically hangs application on OpenWindows 30


Has anyone found a fix for the following problem

Client Software	SunOs 411 X11R5
Server Hardware	Sun IPC
Server Software	SunOs 411 Open Windows 30 w patch 10044437

A Motif 122 application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows 30 server xnews The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect Sometimes pressing Return will
unstick the application but not usually It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isnt hanging If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal The same application when run against other X servers
including MIT X11R5 Xsun DecWindows Tektronix X terminal has no
problems This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
workaround since most of our customers are OpenWindows users

I have tried the following things

    1 Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       10044437

    2 Using mwm version 122 instead of olwm

    3 Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ question 110
       This had the effect of disabling the pointandclick method of
       menu interaction as opposed to the clickanddrag method and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys It did seem to help but I
       was still able to get the application to hang

Repeat By

This is an intermittent problem so youll have to try several times

Click and release on a menu heading pulldown menu will pop up

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs


Any help would be appreciated Thanks in advance
