             I have a problem with icon pixmap My application has to run
   under openwindow and motif I wrote my program in Motif with pixmap and
   icons It runs fine under motifmotif window manager and X11R5mwm But 
   the icon pixmap does not show up under openwinolwm and X11R5olwm

             Has anybody got into this kind of problem Need a clue An 
   example which works in both X11R5motif and openwindow will be great
