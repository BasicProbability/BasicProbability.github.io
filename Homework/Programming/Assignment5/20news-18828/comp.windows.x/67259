 I am getting Linux so I will have InterViews but I dont know how it
 will look  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF but I dont
 know what it looks like either

If youre on the internet and your site isnt sheltered from external
tcpip traffic you can use the Remote Andrew Demo to see what the
Andrew Toolkit looks like

without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the Andrew software  You
