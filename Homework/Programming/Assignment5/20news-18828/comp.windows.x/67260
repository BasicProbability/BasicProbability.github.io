 Cutsie little Macintrashlike icons that are an instant recipe for
 mousitis IMHO System 7 is undoubtedly the worst GUI I have used out of
 that RISCOS MSWombles and X11 simply because it does not provide enough
 keyboard shortcuts Windows I must confess I quite like cover your ears
   because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the
 mouse
 stuff delete
 the user rather than making things easier  and there should always be
 the option to do it your way if you want to which is why I like the
 UNIXX combination so much  its so customizable 
 
 Hear Hear I agree completely One thing I cant stand about
 the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
 the mousewhat if your mouse breaksyour whole system is
 down  I like the mouseit is handy on some occassions such
 as cut and past and moving icons around etc  But for most
 work the keyboard and hot keys are 1020 times faster than
 using the mouse Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
 simple if you are an inexperienced user but how long is it
 before your are experienced A month Two Speaking of PCs at
 the moment
 	I dont think it is too much to ask that window
 programmers provide not only a menumouse interface but also
 look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
 command line interfaces which usually allows you to do more in
 less time IF you are experienced
 	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
 UNIX especially since Unix is at least 500 more powerful than
 DOS
 
And at least 500 more user unfriendly as well
