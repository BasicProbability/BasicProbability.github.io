I am considering making a reasonably large application for free
distribution probably copylefted  I am going to use X  Now Im

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users

If you can use 386bsd
	there is xview3 OpenLook

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via email
		 It has a nice draw program it uses motif which can be used
		 to create graphical frontend to programs
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc233 with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd
		 Last but not least gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module They have an MSWindows driver module for instance

	Also many have written extensions to tktcl thus allowing powerful
	applications For instance tclnm  has snmp extensions for tktcl
	With ease I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs
	photowidget graphical interface file operations database 
	operationsetc The author of tclnm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about 80 lines long  it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router I wrote  a simple
	strip chart script for displaying RealTime ip received
	packetsseconds


	Hope this helps
	Amancio Hasty
