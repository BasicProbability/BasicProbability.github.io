Subject Re XDM  DECnet 

While I cannot answer questions about running XDM over a DECnet I can
say that the following defines must be added to the sitedef before
building R5 before any X clients will work over a DECnet

From sitedef

define ConnectionFlags DTCPCONN DUNIXCONN DDNETCONN
define ExtraLibraries ldnet

Hoping this helps

George
