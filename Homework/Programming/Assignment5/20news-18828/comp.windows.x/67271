Now available xvertext 40 


Summary                                  

xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
an X window previous versions were limited to vertical text Rotation  
is still achieved using XImages but the notion of rotating a whole font
first has been dropped

Whats new

Ive added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings  thus
speeding up redraws

Where can I get it
