Subject Bitplaned nonchunky pixel cfb

Is there a PD version of cfb or other PD server stuff which has a colour frame
buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode ie where the screen
memory is grouped so that bit 0 of every pixel is here bit 1 is there etc

The only such beast I know if at the moment is the GfxBase server for the
Commodore Amiga and it is commercial I dont know if they wrote their own cfb
but I suspect they did

Please respond by email as I dont read this group

Many thanks
Dave
