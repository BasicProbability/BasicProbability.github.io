Subject Announcing tcpview A Motifbased TCPIP protocol analyzer


Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW  We have several
Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets These are good tools but they are 1 heavy 
2 hard to find when you need one 3 limited in their software expandibility
4 difficult to use to upload data for analysis 5 cannot be remotely
operated and 6 cannot resolve names with DNS requiring much manual 
manipulation of the name table  We also sometimes use tcpdump but we found 
it 1 too difficult for most people 2 did not have enough information for
many protocols 3 could not be used interactively 4 could not handle
TCP streams and 5 could not read Sniffer files  However tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily
modified  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features

Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 42 and
SunOS 41 respectively  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump
It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun  To build tcpview you will
need Motif 11 or better

The following files are available for anonymous ftp from 
ftpcacwashingtonedu in pubnetworking

tcpview10tarZ	tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpview10suntarZ	Sun4 binaries
tcpview10dectarZ	DEC Mips Ultrix 42 binaries

What tcpview adds to tcpdump
 easier interface
 enhanced protocol decoding
 hex display of frame
 capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt
 can show ethernet addresses with manufacturers name
 ethernet address host table
 can easily follow a stream highlighting outoforder frames
 can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional
	processing


CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 221

New features

Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files  When used with r the 
file type will be automatically detected

Can now read in and use an SNMP MIB file

The hex format has been changed

New time options have been added

Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets

Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers S flag

New flags
R	read Sniffer file  Not usually needed except for reading from stdin
ttt	prints delta times
tttt	prints times relative to the first frame
W	write a Sniffer save file use with w
x	print frame minus linklevel header in hexdump format
