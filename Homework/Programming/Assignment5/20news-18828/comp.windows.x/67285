Is there anyway to use X Windows over an async line  Clearly you could use
                                x
It is X window

No it isnt  It is the X Window System or X11 or X or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium  In fact
doing man X on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you

     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used
     when referring to this software

                                  X
                           X Window System
                             X Version 11
                     X Window System Version 11
                                 X11

There is no such thing as X Windows or X Window despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags  This probably tells you something
about how much to trust the trade rags  if they cant even get the NAME
of the window system right why should one trust anything else they have 
to say

With regard to dialup X11 implementations there are several  You can
buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies including both 
GraphOn and NCD  In fact Im composing this from an NCD running X11
over serial lines across 144 kbaud connection  

NCD also sells a softwareonly package that provides XRemote which is
NCDs implementation of serial X11 for PCs  There may be other such 
software packages available

X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
X11 over lowspeed connections  Its called Low Bandwidth X LBX and 
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCDs XRemote 

It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various 
sorts of hardware

Followups directed to compwindowsx
