Subject Re Xsun not running on SPARCclassic

In article 1r3th9INNdtptomrzunipassaude rankwinfunipassaude Christian Rank writes
Ive installed X11R5 with patches for Solaris 21 on our SPARCstation LX 
SPARCclassic pool On the LX X11R5 runs fine but on the classics
after giving the command startx Xsun prints the following messages
	WARNING cg3mmap cant map dummy space
	Mapping cg3c No such device or address
and exits

Does anybody know how to fix this problem

Im just guessing here but Id guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have
1152x900 resolution and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is 
1024x768
