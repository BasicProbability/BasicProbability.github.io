Did you install the sunkbd patch  Its in the contrib directory on export
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly except the following
The End PageUp PageDown on the 6key cluster arent recognized
Even the compose key works  Though I cant seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed

Anyone have a fix for the last two

fix the table in X11R5mitserverddxsun or
use xmodmap1

put
  stty pass8 setenv LCCTYPE iso88591 setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
in your login the first prevents the stripping of bit 7
the second sets the locale the third makes less1 show the character
instead of the octal representation
