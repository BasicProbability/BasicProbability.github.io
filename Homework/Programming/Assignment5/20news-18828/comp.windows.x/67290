Subject How to get 24bit color with xview frames 

Hi 

I am using Xview 30 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video My video input is 24 bit color

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame  Frame xvcreateNULLFRAMENULL
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits
I tried using the following Xlib code 

XVisualInfo visualinfo
int depth  24
Colormap colormap
XSetWindowAttributes attribs
unsigned long valuemask  0
Window win
Xvopaque frame

win  xvgetframeXVXID
XMatchVisualInfodisplayscreendepthTrueColorvisualinfo

 So far so good 

colormap  XCreateColormapdisplaywinvisualinfoAllocNone

 It dies here with a BadMatch error  

attribscolormap  colormap
valuemask  CWColormap
XChangeWindowAttributesdisplaywvaluemaskattribs
XSetWindowColormapdisplaywincolormap


Am I using a completely wrong approach here  Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview  What am I doing wrong 

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay

Thanks again
