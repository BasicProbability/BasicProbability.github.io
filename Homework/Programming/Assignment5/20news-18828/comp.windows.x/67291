Subject Compiling X programs


Hi Guys

	It has been a long time since I wrote a program using X I am trying to 
	get myself refamiliarize with X I would appreciate your help regarding
	the following problem

	I am trying to compile a simple X program on sun running sunOS 412 
	using
	cc o ex exc lXaw lXmu lXt lXext lX11 lm
	I am getting an error

	ld Undefined symbol
		getwmShellWidgetClass
		getapplicationShellWidgetClass


 The simple program I tried to compile is given below

include stdioh
include X11Intrinsich
include X11StringDefsh
include X11XawFormh

mainargcargv
int 	argc
char	argv

	Widget	topLevel
	Widget	frame

	topLevel  XtInitializeexExNULL0 argcargv
	frame  XtCreateManagedWidgetFormformWidgetClasstopLevelNULL0
	XtRealizeWidgettopLevel
	XtMainLoop





	I got the same error when I tried to build xpostit using the Imakefile
	provided with the software

	I have compiled X programs before not on this machine but on other 
	machines running sunOS 40 and X11 R4 I did not get this error message
	Can anybody tell me why I am getting these messages

	I would appreciate if you can email your responses to me at
