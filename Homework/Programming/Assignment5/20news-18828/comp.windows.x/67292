Hi netlanders

Does anybody know if there is something like Macintosh Hypercard for any UNIX 
platform

There are several products you might investigate  If youve got
20000 per seat and highend hardware Gain Momentum might be a good
choice  It isnt compatible with HyperCard but has a similar
architecture and way more functionality  I dont have contact
information but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldnt
be too hard to find

If youre running News on SPARC check out HyperLook
hyperlookturingcom  It uses Postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting
but not so good for nonprogrammers  It was 995 last I heard

You might also look at our product MetaCard  Were alphatesting
direct importing of HyperCard stacks weve even made the test release
available for anonymous FTP so were obviously the closest in
functionality  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs
495  Email to infometacardcom for more details

Thanks in advance


Ron
