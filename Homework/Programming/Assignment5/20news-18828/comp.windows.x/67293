Subject Regression Testing and X

Id appreciate any feedback on captureplayback tools for use with X clients

I have pulled XTM from public domain but it appears to be set up to test
X servers not X clients 

Any comparisonscomments on regression testing tools would be great 
particularly XTM XRunner Autotester and SRIs CAPBAK SMARTS and EXDIFF
