Subject Re need shading program example in X

 
 I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
 fi Gouroudshading of triangles This is fairly complex to do with plain
 X Simpler shading models are implemented already fi in x3d ask archie
 where to get the latest version
 For Gouroud a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
 only either MITSHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
 with it or PEXOpenGL which should be able to shade themselves The portable
 vanilla X way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage
 what would be good enough to do static things as fi fractal landscapes
 or such stuff
 
 To speak about POVRay the X previewer that comes with the original source
 package is not that good especially in speed protocolfriendlyness and
 ICCCM compliance Have a look on x256q my own preview code It is on
 
 14176111pubgfxraymiscx256q
 
 The README states the points where it is better than xwindowc from
 POVRay 10
 

The version I have is using the x256q code instead of the default X Windows
code  I have it currently running on a DEC Alpha running OpenVMS AXP and
so far have been pretty impressed  The only sideeffect of x256q is that
it requires xstdcmap best be run before it will work annoyning but not a
show stopper
