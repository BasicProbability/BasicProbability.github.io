Subject How to mask the left button

I am posting this for a friend whose news service is fubared as usual
 I will forward replies to him or if you want to try to reply directly

I have an event handler working for a ButtonPressMask like

  XtAddEventHandler plotdatadisplay ButtonPressMask FALSE
                    showmouseposition plotdata

but I would like to be able to have two types of actions one to occur
with the left mouse the other the right and perhaps one with the
middle  So my event handler would look more like


  XtAddEventHandler plotdatadisplay leftButtonPressMask FALSE
                    showleftmouseposition plotdata

  XtAddEventHandler plotdatadisplay rightButtonPressMask FALSE
                    showrightmouseposition plotdata

However I dont know how to make my leftButtonPressMask  There didnt seem
to be one in the event mask lists I had on hand although Button1MotionMask
looked promising  My references also mentioned using  to or two
mask events  Can you  use  to and two masks  Would I want to in this
case 

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks
