Subject Editres under PieTVTwm

Hi looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem Im
having with MIT X11R5s editres in particular under twm variants

For a start 9 times out of 10 but NOT always editres wont
grab a widget tree when running on our NCD Decwindows Xterms
which Im told will be fixed when the R5 not R4 XDm is installed
OK so I tried running it on a Sun running real R5 on the same
network  I get a widget tree but its ALWAYS for TWM Icon Manager

Anybody know of any patches for a twm or b editres that I should
look at

Thanks
K
