Subject REPOST XView slider

Hi Xperts

this is a repost no one responded to my desperate yell 8
I cant believe there is no XView wizards any more 8

Im using sliders in my XView apps usually with editable numeric
field But I seem to have no control over the length of this field
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters
in some  it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANELMAXVALUE 

As I understand PANELVALUEDISPLAYLENGTH which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items doesnt
work in the case of slider despite the fact that panelh
contains the following bit

	 Panelmultilinetextitem Panelnumerictextitem
	  Panelslideritem and Paneltextitem attributes
	 
	PANELNOTIFYLEVEL	 PANELATTRATTRENUM			 152
	PANELVALUEDISPLAYLENGTH	 PANELATTRATTRINT		 182

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders
But 1 setting this attribute gives nothing and 2 xvgetting
this attribute gives warning Bad attribute and returns value 0

Strange thing is that DECs port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields but not Suns Xview

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me
and clear this problem 

Any help is very much appreciated

Yuri
