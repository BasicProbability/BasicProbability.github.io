Subject 24bit Static color will clients like it

Im writing an X server for some videogeneration equipment  The
hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a 24bit
static color visual  I would really like to have the server just
present this static visual but Im not sure if this will be 
acceptable to most X clients  The three problems I see are

  1 The colormap though huge is static
  2 All pixels would be 3 bytes wide
  3 Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the
     translation RGBYUV will introduce some rounding error

Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask will these
limitations thwart many X clients  Or will most of the X stuff
floating around blithely accept what theyre given  I could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of eg 8 bits 
but Id rather avoid this if not necessary

I know there are no absolutes but Id appreciate hearing peoples
opinions and suggestions  Thanks
