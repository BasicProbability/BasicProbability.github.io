Subject A Question I Do Not Found In FAQ

I created a pixmap or drawable window then used XDrawLine function 
drawed a line as below fingure

		width  300
	
					
					
				p1	
					
				 	 height  300
				  	
				   	
				    	
				     	
				      	
				       p3
					 
	 
					    
					     p2

	I created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 300x300
But I draw line from p1x1270y1100 to p2x2500y2800
My question is dose the XDrawLine function can finger out that correct
p3x3 and y3 for me If you calculate x3 and y3 

x3  300

  art tan  800  100500  270  7181 degrees

y3  100  x3tan  100  300tan7181  19858  integer 199

How do I prove XDrawLine give me the right x3 y3 or not
Please dont ask me why I dont created a 900x900 pixmap No I dont
wan to 

Thanks in advance
