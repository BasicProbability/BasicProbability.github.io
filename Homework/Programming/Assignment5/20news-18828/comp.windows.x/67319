 Has anyone found a fix for the following problem
 
 Client Software	SunOs 411 X11R5
 Server Hardware	Sun IPC
 Server Software	SunOs 411 Open Windows 30 w patch 10044437
 
 A Motif 122 application will periodically hang when run against the
 OpenWindows 30 server xnews The pulldown is displayed but then no
 button actions have any effect Sometimes pressing Return will
 unstick the application but not usually It looks like the pulldown is
 grabbing the focus and never letting go Other windows on the display
 continue to get updated so the server isnt hanging If I log in from
 another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
 back to normal The same application when run against other X servers
 including MIT X11R5 Xsun DecWindows Tektronix X terminal has no
 problems This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
 workaround since most of our customers are OpenWindows users

I have seen the same problem using a SPARCStation 10 Solaris 21 OW 31
In my case it happens far more often than periodically

Help
