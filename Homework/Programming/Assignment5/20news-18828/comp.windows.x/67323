  Ive gotten very few posts on this group in the last couple days  I
  recently added it to my feed list  Is it just me or is this group
  near death
 
 
 Seen from the mailing list side Im getting about the right amount of
 traffic

And seen from my point of view I get far too much articles to keep up with
them I am lucky if I can scan through the subjects from time to time
