   The application creates window with a button Quit and Press me
   The button Press me pops up a dialog box The strange feature of
   this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
   first time If I try to pop it up a 2nd time 3rd 4th  time 
   it is much slower
  
  The shell is waiting for the windowmanager to respond to its
  positioning request  The windowmanager is not responding because
  it thinks the window is already in the right place
  
  Exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
  me all information greatly received

The only time Ive seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child
without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor
The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got
picked up by the child  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if
the timing was right
