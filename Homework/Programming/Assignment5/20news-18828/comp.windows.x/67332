Subject Sun360  X11R5  undeletable console messages

We have an old Sun360 here which gets occasional use  When X11R5 is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable  After X is fully
started we run an xterm as the console  the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console  Refresh window fails
to remove them  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them

At boot time the 360 lists two framebuffers    devcgfour0 and devbwtwo1
Were running X in color and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the BW framebuffer and thereby not getting deleted

My question is has anyone else seen this and is there an easy way to get rid
of these messages

Please reply by email to hughminmoscouk

    looking for a more general solution
