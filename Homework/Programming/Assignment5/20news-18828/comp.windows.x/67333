Subject Re 24bit Static color will clients like it

 Im writing an X server for some videogeneration equipment  The
 hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a 24bit
 static color visual  I would really like to have the server just
 present this static visual but Im not sure if this will be 
 acceptable to most X clients  The three problems I see are
 
   1 The colormap though huge is static
   2 All pixels would be 3 bytes wide
   3 Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the
      translation RGBYUV will introduce some rounding error
 
 Being more of a server guy than a client guy I ask will these
 limitations thwart many X clients  Or will most of the X stuff
 floating around blithely accept what theyre given  I could write
 the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of eg 8 bits 
 but Id rather avoid this if not necessary
 

Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated
8 bit PseudoColor visual only to get standard x clients motif apps and
thelike to run I strongly suppose you to emulate at least

 24 Bit TrueColor Should be no problem only some translation Rounding
  should not make big misfits
 8 bit PseudoColor More of a problem you have to emulate a colormap
  pixel indices conversion stuff Furthermore you should run your default
  screen on this visual
