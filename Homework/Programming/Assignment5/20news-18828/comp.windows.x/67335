From slosserntscrdnavyMIL Steve Slosser
Subject UNIX interest group  Where is it

I know that this is not the correct place to post this but I have 
exhausted all other logical options  I used to be on the INFOUNIX 
newsgroup mailer  The mailers mysteriously quite coming around the end of
last year  All emails requesting that I be placed back on the list have
been ignored  I have been unable to locate the administrator of this list

If anyone knows of the internet address that I can send a the request to
get back on this list can you please send it to me  If you dont know
of this specific newsgroup mailer I would appreciate the address of any
UNIXrelated newsgroup  Thanks

PS  Sorry for the nonXrelated question
