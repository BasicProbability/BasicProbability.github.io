Subject Re 24bit Static color will clients like it

 Im writing an X server for some videogeneration equipment  The
 hardware is truecolor in YUV space in X terms it has a 24bit
 static color visual  I would really like to have the server just
 present this static visual but Im not sure if this will be 
 acceptable to most X clients  The three problems I see are
 
   1 The colormap though huge is static
   2 All pixels would be 3 bytes wide
   3 Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space the
      translation RGBYUV will introduce some rounding error

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit
TrueColor visual The main problems we encountered were

	1 Clients written with logic like the following

	    if DefaultDepth  1
		 Assume default depth is 8bit 

	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window
	   to run correctly

	2 Other clients didnt even bother to do that much and just
	   outright assumed they had a dynamic visual class with a
	   dynamic colormap XStoreColors doesnt work on cmaps
	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes but
	   many clients dont bother to check they just start
	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you

Though both are clearly client error this is the case with so many
clients that its easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a
default root window visual than it ever would be for all these client
writers to change their clients to do the right thing
