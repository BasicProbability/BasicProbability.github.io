Subject Xm121 and OW server


We have a program written with X11R5 and Motif 121  It runs fine on the Sun
X11R5 server and MacX  When that program is run under the Sparc 2 and the
OW server the program crashed itself along with the server  It crashed before
the first window had showed up

I got the following error from X
XIO  fatal IO error 32 Broken pipe on X server perot00
      after 62 requests 59 known processed with 0 events remaining
      The connection was probably broken by a server shutdown or KillClient

I have run the program with xmon and below is the last twenty lines or so from
xmon before both the program and server crashed
