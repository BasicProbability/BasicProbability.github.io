Subject Looking for updated XView textedit source wdnd support

The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section 
of X11R5 included the source to the textedit program  Id like to take 
the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalklike message 
server and maybe for ToolTalk while Im at it since the Sunsupplied
textedit binary doesnt seem to speak tooltalk

However the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3  For
example the OWN 30 textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
dropsite in the main control area while the source in contribxview
knows nothing about drag and drop

The texteditc included in the xview sources says its version 1550
dated 52290 while doing a what textedit on the OWN 30 binary says

        texteditc 262 910914 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        dragdropc 126 910914 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        tooltalkc 216 910914 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        dsrelnamec    17 910914 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro

So does anyone know if the 91491 sources to textedit are available
Id really like to work from the latest source if possible

Please reply by email and Ill post a summary if theres enough 
interest
