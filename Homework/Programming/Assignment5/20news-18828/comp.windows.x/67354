Subject Which X events are generated on application exit

Im writing an application running under X using Motif and I need to do
some stuff when the application quits  Now when I shut down my X Windows
session it doesnt seem to send a SIGTERM or whatever signal to my
application Im trapping various signals like that  Therefore I thought
I could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed

However I seem to get DestroyNotify events whenever I move windows  Is
there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed
some field to check or some combination of events

Replies by email please and I will summarise

Thanks for any help
