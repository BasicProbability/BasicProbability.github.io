Dear Folks

Its a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program 
Xavier an audio and video  extension to InterViews

XaviereXtension AV class for IntERviews is a C class library
that adds multimedia capability to InterViews It allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects

Specifically it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in InterViews 30131 and it does so without changing the
source code for the original classes though several configuration
