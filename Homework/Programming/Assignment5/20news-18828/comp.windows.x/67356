Subject Re Pulldown menu periodically hangs application on OpenWindows 30

 A Motif 122 application will periodically hang when run against the
 OpenWindows 3 server xnews

I have seen the same problem using a SPARCStation 10 Solaris 21 OW 31
In my case it happens far more often than periodically

I dont know if theres a corresponding patch for Solaris 21 but this
sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 10049206 the
Solaris 1x olwm Jumbo patch

	1108642  window system can hang in an errant pointer grab

Actually I suspect that the OW 31 problem may be different since the
README file says that this patch is just a SunOS 4x version of the OW 31
olwm but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch and
they forgot to take it out in the 06 version
