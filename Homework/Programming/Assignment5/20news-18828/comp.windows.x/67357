Subject Re Xsun not running on SPARCclassic

Im just guessing here but Id guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have
1152x900 resolution and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is 
1024x768

Ive used X11R5 with classics set for both 1024x768 and 1152x900 you
can choose which resolution you want in the PROM monitor before
booting  One person had trouble with X11R5 that was fixed by
using the multiscreen version  Heres how our version was built
You can just copy usrlocalX11R5binXsun from farsiderutgersedu
if you just want to see whether this version will work
