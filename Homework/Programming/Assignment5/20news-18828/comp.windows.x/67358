I created a pixmap or drawable window then used XDrawLine function 
to draw a clipped line   300

I created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 300x300
But I draw line from p1x1270y1100 to p2x2500y2800
My question is dose the XDrawLine function can finger out that correct
p3x3 and y3 for me If you calculate x3 and y3 

If youre asking does the X server perform clipping
correctly when drawing lines the answer is yes
