Subject Standard Colormaps

Im working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding 
standard colormaps

The X11R5 documentation says Usually a window manager creates 
these colormaps  I wonder what window manager the writer had 
in mind  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps

Of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps  
However xstdcmap doesnt seem to try very hard to avoid 
conflicts with the default colormap  When I use standard 
colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black  
So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very 
problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid  Perhaps 
if every application used standard colormaps things would 
be wonderful  But not many applications seem to use 
standard colormaps

Finally the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation 
XmuStandardColormap and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent 
with the section 143 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation

    According to the section 143 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation p 436

    For GrayScale colormaps only the colormap redmax redmult and 
    basepixel members are defined  The other members are ignored  
    To compute a GrayScale pixel value use the following expression

            gray  redmult  basepixel 0xFFFFFFFF

    XmuGetColormapAllocation defined in mitlibXmuCmapAllocc is 
    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap defined in mitlibXmuLookupCmapc
    to select redmax greenmax and bluemax values for the 
    call to XmuStandardColormap  When the RGBGRAYMAP property is 
    specified XmuGetColormapAllocation sets redmax to 30 of the 
    total number of cells in the gray scale sets greenmax to 59 
    of the total number and sets bluemax ot 11 of the total number
    Referring to section 143 one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation 
    to set redmax to the total number of cells in the gray scale

    When the RGBGRAYMAP property is specified XmuStandardColormap 
    defined in mitlibXmuStdCmapc sets redmult greenmult 
    and bluemult all equal to 1  Referring to section 143 
    one would expect greenmult and bluemult to be ignored

    When redmult greenmult and bluemult all equal 1 
    XmuCreateColormap defined in mitlibXmuCrCmapc constructs 
    a gray map The sum of redmax greenmax and bluemax gives 
    the maximum gray value  Referring to section 143 on would 
    expect redmax to give the maximum gray value
