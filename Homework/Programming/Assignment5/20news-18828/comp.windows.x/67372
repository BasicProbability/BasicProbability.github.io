Subject Keyboard mapping and window placement questions

These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these
specific questions

1  If my application depends on modifiers what is the best lookup method
My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping for each key press with a 
modifier or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
in a lookup table  I would like to do it the second way but I cant seem to
get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers  I know that
when an app calls XSetModifierMapping a MappingNotify event is generated
nonmaskable which I can pick up and modify my internal table  But I dont
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap  If I use Xt all 
OReilly has to say is is automatically handled by Xt  If I use Xlib ala XNextEvent I get nothing  This all stems from problems with users of 
the Sun 45 keyboard and the NumLock plus various AltMetaetc modifier 
requirements

2  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
of my main window  I want it at the same y coord and their rightleft
sides touching  What I need to ask for is the xy coord of the window 
managers border for the main window  This should ring a bell with anyone
who has called XtMoveWidget immediately checking the xy after the move
and seeing that it is right and in their next callback asking for the xy
and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border

Any help would be most appreciated
