Subject Overriding default WM Behaviour


I posted this about tow weeks ago but never saw it make it Then again
Ive had some problems with the mail system Apologies if this appears
for the second time

Usually when I start up an application I first get the window outline
on my display I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen Yet when I specify the geometry 
option the window appears right away the properties specified by
the geometry argument The question now is

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick Ive tried explicitly setting window
size and position but that did alter the normal program behaviour

Thanks for any hints
 Robert

PS Im working in plain X using tvtwm
