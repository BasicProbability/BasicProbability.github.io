Subject Frame buffer question for X11R5 Sun

X Window installation on a Sun4470 with CG6 alone and with CG2 as
screen00 and CG6 as screen01

Questions
1  Are there any hardware configuration changes on the CG2 andor
CG6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the
CG2 frame buffer in the vme bus

2  The CG6 is called a graphics accelerator as apposed to a frame buffer
What is the significance of this to the X server and how do we install
the SunOS driver  X to be compatable


I would appreciate any information on this 
I am posting this on the behalf of Dr John Charlton who does not have net
access Please reply to him directly at charltonbmeuncedu or just send
it at this address and I will forward it 

Thank you for your help
