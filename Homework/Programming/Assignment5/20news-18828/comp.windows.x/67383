Subject How to access 24bit color on cg8

We have a Sun 380 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card

The cg8 is supposed to support both a 24bit color visual and a monochrome visual
The default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome and we are unable to change it to
the 24bit visual We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth 24 but had no
success  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24bit deep visual only monochrome 

There are two possible solutions
	If someone has patches for X11R5 Xsun server could they forward them to us

	Otherwise could someone instruct us how to access the 24bit color in openwindows
