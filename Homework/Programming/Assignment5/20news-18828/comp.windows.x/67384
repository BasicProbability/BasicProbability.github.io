Subject Xsun not finding default font Sol21

Hi netters

Ive just built X11R5 pl 21 under Solaris 21 Ive used the multiscreen 
patch as well as the R5SunOS patch and everything builds great except 
for that error message Xsun gives me upon startup It says 
Cannot set default font path stuff deleted and Cannot set default font
fixed If I supply the fp option it doesnt complain about the font path
but still complains about the font I have symlinks from usrlib to the 
place where my distribution lives

Could somebody help me

	joel
