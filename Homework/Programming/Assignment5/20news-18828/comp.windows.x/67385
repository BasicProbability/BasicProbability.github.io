Subject Callback parameter problem after X11R5 upgrade


Weve just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems
with some of our applications that use Motif 11  It appears that pointer to
the widget being passed to the callback function ie the w of
w client call  is nil  The client and call pointers are okay in some
instances but bogus in other instances

We are running SunOS 412 on a Sun 4  After compiling X11R5 and all 23
patches with the MotifBC flag set we recompiled Motif and then we 
recompiled the application

Did we skip a step or leave something out  Is there a flag that we should
have used  Should we have left Motif alone

Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Thanks
Kathy
