What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas   

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself To give you a realworld example here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other Its not too much of a load on our
Ethernet with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 2030 people on each
segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have
10 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns
because youre now on effectively a 33 MHz 486 Of course DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have 10 working programs running youll know it


Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year  The link I want to use 
though ISDN 64K is costly and the bandwidth limited  Thats why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it


Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run 1520 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth

Hmmm  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  Are you
running any standard MSWindows programs like Word   What sort of 
packets go blazing through What size link do you have 2Mb or 10Mb 
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points


It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going
to see a slowdown from Xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also
 

What do you mean by network things  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DVX protocol in transferring these 
images with Xcalls and displaying them on a clients machine
