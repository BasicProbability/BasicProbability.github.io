Subject Connecting a digitiser to X REPOST

Hi there

I posted this to compwindowsxintrinsics but got no response so Im posting
here

Im wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation an HP 720
It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets  However this digitiser makes use of the serial
port so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver

The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from
devices listed in the usrlibX11Xdevices file   display number
I shouldnt think I would be able to simply insert devrs232c as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work  But maybe Im wrong  Am I

What I would like to know is does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for X rather than just as input to a
specific X application  If so what were the steps required for installation
Did you need a special device driver  Did the manufacturer supply it  Are
there generic public domain device drivers around  I understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats

Any help would be greatly appreciated

Cheers
 Vaughan
