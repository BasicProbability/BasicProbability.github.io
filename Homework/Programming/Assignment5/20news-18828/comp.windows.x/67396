Hello Xperts out there
Ive just built X11R5 for SunOS 411SPARC
I have gcc22 and Id like to use its 64bit capability
to generate an X11 release which will render to the frame
buffer using storedouble 64bit machine code
Can anyone tell me which directoriessource files
compiler switches to begin with

thanks in advance
