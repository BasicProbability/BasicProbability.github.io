Subject Reentrancy of Xlib functions Known problem
From vissereedwsaitwolbhpcomau Martin Visser

Ive found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding reentrancy I
decided to implement an animated cursor using 6 created cursors by calling
XDefineCursor from a SIGALRM signal handler This is used to indicate we are
waiting for a operator request to complete on a production control system
I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
the standard cursor when complete I found dumped core  and upon analysis
it was when the SIGALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call XDrawString
was doing a bcopy presumably an internal structure when the XDefineCursor
was called Presumably the internal structure that XDrawString was manipulating
was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldnt have been

Has anyone else experienced this Is there any official documentation that
says you should ensure this doesnt happen Or should bcopy be atomic
We are running on SGI Irix 401 with X11R4
