 As I announced at the X Technical Conference in January I would like
 to
 make ImakeTeX the Imake support for using the TeX typesetting system
 publically available Currently ImakeTeX is in beta test here at the
 computer science department of Dortmund University and I am looking
 for
 some more beta testers preferably with different TeX and Imake
 installations

Judging from the responses so far I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that ImakeTeX is not for installing TeX but for
using it With ImakeTeX you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs makeindex bibtex Simply
type make and your documents DVI file will be uptodate All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you Here is such an Imakefile

	include TeXtmpl
	PaperFormatA4
	SimpleLatexTargetdocument

The generated Makefile provides the following commands

    make depend    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    inputsomefile

    make dvi       Generate an uptodate DVI file

    make viewdvi   Display it on your screen

    make ps        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps    Display it

    make clean     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If 

a this seems attractive to you
b you are willing to test ImakeTeX and send me a short test report
c you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   however the German version is completed and included

then you are invited as a beta tester I am looking forward to your email
