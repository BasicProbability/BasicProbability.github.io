Subject German keyboard ALTGR 


Hi ppl

I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS10 and am trying to get the german
keyboard working I have already recompiled my kernel and the german
keyboard in the textmode works just fine
I have found out that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X
called Xmodmapgr in usrlibX11 so I ran xmodmap usrlibX11Xmodmapgr
My first impression was very good I was able to get Z and Y straight 
Theres still a little problem I cant solve however
I cannot get at the backslash bar brackets and curly brackets
The ALTGR key doesnt seem to work
I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does
Looking up its keycode 113 in the Xmodmap I found the entry Modeswitch
which doesnt ring any bell The entries for the keys I cannot use seem
to be correct Example keycode XX  ssharp questn backslash
The first 2 entries I can even get at The first one is the unmodified
key and the second is the key with shift but what is the 3rd
My guess is that it should be the key with ALTGR but it isnt
If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them
help would be appreciated

CU

Alaric
