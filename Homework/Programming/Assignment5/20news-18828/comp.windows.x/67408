Subject ImakeTeX looking for beta testers

As I announced at the X Technical Conference in January I would like to
make ImakeTeX the Imake support for using the TeX typesetting system
publically available Currently ImakeTeX is in beta test here at the
computer science department of Dortmund University and I am looking for
some more beta testers preferably with different TeX and Imake
installations
