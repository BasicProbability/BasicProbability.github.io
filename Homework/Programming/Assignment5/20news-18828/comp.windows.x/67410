Subject Help in developing a XWindows interface for GDB

Hi

  I am trying to write an Xwindows based interface that runs on top of GDB Could 
anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to fork GDB off as a 
subprocess  I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program the 
following happens 

PROGRAM 

	main
	
           int x
 

	   printfenter x  
           scanfd x
           printfx  dn x 

        

OUTPUT 

	The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement When I type
in a value like 5 then all the printfs output comes out at one time


Is there any other way besides using PIPES to do this ie like ioctl or something else 

Thanks

Deepak
