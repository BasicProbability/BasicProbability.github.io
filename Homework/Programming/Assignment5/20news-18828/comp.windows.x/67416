Subject Re XV 300 has escaped

Wasnt the shareware fee a suggestion by John
Is so then its up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
honour it and part with money  Personally if I was in his position I would
do exactly the same thing John has obviously put in lot of time and effort
into xv and why shouldnt he receive some money for it

Just my pennies worth

Keep up the good work John
