 I have a problem I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes
  gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request
 
 As far as I can tell from the manual the only attribute which may give
 a BadMatch is the colormap if it belongs to a wrong visual But the
 visual was correctly matched

I got several answers the most complete was from Errol Crary 
errolctvtvTekcom
I have just looked at the R4 server listings mitserverdixwindowc 
and there are several ways in which you can get a BadMatch error even
though my OReilly book only says BorderWidth is nonzero for InputOnly

1 if class  InputOnly  bw  0  depth  0


2  Find out if the depth and visual are acceptable for this Screen 


3 if vmask  CWBorderPixmap  CWBorderPixel  0 
    class  InputOnly 
    depth  pParentdrawabledepth


4 if vmask  CWColormap  0 
    class  InputOnly 
    visual  ancwoptvisual  ancwoptcolormap  None


So 
case 1 is InputOnly which is not your case  it seems to be the
     OReilly case
Case 2 should not be the case since you got the visual for the screen
Case 3 looks suspicious you are giving no CWBorder in the attribute
     mask and since the visual is not the parent depth I would suspect you
     need to supply a border pixel from the new colormap you are going to use
     for this window
Case 4 does not seem to be the problem since you do supply the CWColormap
     in the attributes

                             Thanks for your help
