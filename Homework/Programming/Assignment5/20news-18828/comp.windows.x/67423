Subject Need help with MITMAGICCOOKIE

Im trying to turn on Xauthorization using MITMAGICCOOKIE on my servers
CPU heads HP700RX Xterminals but Im running into a couple of problems

First at least one of our applications Maple doesnt seem to understand 
how to deliver the magic cookie and wont run on a display with authorization
turned on 

Second we have people with client software on remote machines and I
really dont want to hassle them with having to copy their Xauthority
file to the remote machine assuming that the clients there support
Xauthorization

So what I would like to do is turn on MITMAGICCOOKIE by default with
nonprivileged users able to turn it off  dropping back to hostbased
authorization

Yes I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the
heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals but
nonprivileged users cant do this

Ive checked with the HP Support Line and there doesnt appear to be a way
Can anyone confirm this or do you know of a way to accomplish what I
want

BTW Im running HPUX 90 and Vue 30

Thanks in advance
Rick
