Subject ButtonPressButtonRelease events  multiple clients

How can I capture ButtonPressButtonRelease events in multiple clients
I want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen
I can get  KeyPressKeyRelease and Pointer motion events but if the user
is pressing the mouse button in the same location the mouse doesnt move
I cant capture the events  

The OReilly Xlib Programming Manual vol 1 says on page 252
   Only one client can select button events on any one window at one time 
    due to the grab that automatically takes place  

Any help would be appreciated
