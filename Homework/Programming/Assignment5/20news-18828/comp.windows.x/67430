Subject click to focus vs point to focus

I am having the problem of ensuring pointtofocus when the mouse
cursor enters a window in my application  Im using InterViews
but that may not matter this seems to be a generic problem in X
For example I use OpenWindows on a Sparc2 with pointtofocus
set and that generally works but not always depending on what
was going on in some window when I move the cursor from one shell
tool window to another  Or so it seems

My question then is what can I do within X to guarantee pointto
focus within my application  Thanks for any response

Dave
