The Andrew User Interface System version 51 our CDrom version was
developed for AIX  version 31 on the IBM RS6000 and many other
platforms  To accomodate AIX version 32 we have created a patch to
the sources  The patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymousftp from the
internet host emsworthandrewcmuedu 12824540 in the directory
aixpatch  For those without internet access a 35 diskette can be
ordered for 10 by sending or faxing a purchase order to the address
below 

The base 51 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftped from the
same host

Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
AUIS to compile under AIX32



The Andrew User Interface System AUIS is a comprehensive environment
on top of X11 windows in which you can create use and mail multimedia
applications and documents   A major advantage of AUIS is the
capability to recursively embed objects  Thus one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts indentation and other typography but
also  contains embedded raster images spreadsheets drawing editors
equations simple animations and so on These embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects including text

AUIS has three components

    of applications beginning with the ez text editor a help
    system a system monitoring tool an editorbased shell
    interface and other editors corresponding to the various
    available types of objects 

    The Andrew Toolkit ATK is a portable objectoriented
    userinterface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
    objects can be embedded in oneanother  With the toolkit
    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
    easily as those that come with the system 

    The Andrew Message System AMS provides a multimedia interface
    to mail and bulletinboards  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication return receipts automatic sorting of
    mail vote collection and tabulation enclosures audit trails
    of related messages and subscription management It also
