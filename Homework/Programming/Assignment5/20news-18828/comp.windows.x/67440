 And here is the first patch  The following fixes some problems with the
 Imakefile files and makes it possible to compile xv300 under Solaris without 
 having to use the ucb stuff

Oops I didnt get the signal processing right thats what I get from doing
the work on an ascii terminal Here is the fixed patch

The patches for xvh need to use ifdef SVR4 rather than the
overly complex if definedsun  definedSYSV in order to
generically compile XV on i386SVR4Architecture  Also rand and srand
dont work very welluse lrand48 and seed48 to get better results
Otherwise xv300 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 404 box
with XFree86 and gcc233  I just uncommented the gcc definition in
the Makefile added LusrX386lib IusrX386include to the COPTS
line and modified LIBS to include lsocket lnsl  Really John if you
just use the Imakefile things like this dont even have to get
mentioned
