Subject Re How to mask the left button

One way to mask the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the
XAddEventHandler send to your eventhandling function in your case it is the
showmouseposition function 

If the XEvent arrive in this function as 

XEvent pevent

then the value of peventxbuttonbutton is the button that was pressed So 
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them In case
it was not clear peventxeventbutton is an int 

By the way you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with 
these MotionMasks I would be grateful I can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring In 
essence I would like an seperate eventhandler for motion with each button 
Unfortunately the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the 
value of the pressed button

Any ideas
