Subject NonRoman Font Availability

Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of nonRoman fonts
for XWindows Especially Unicode andor han idiographic fonts

Also how about conversion tools for getting PCMacintosh fonts into a
format suitable for X I would assume it is not too difficult for
bitmap fonts

The FAQs for this group and compfonts are not very helpful on these
questions
