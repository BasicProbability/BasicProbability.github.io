From Rick Miller rickeeuwmedu
Subject XFace

Im not familiar at all with the format of these XFace thingies but
after seeing them in some folks headers Ive got to see them and
maybe make one of my own

Ive got dpgview on my Linux box which displays uncompressed XFaces
and Ive managed to compile uncompface too but now that Im looking
for them I cant seem to find any XFaces in anyones news headers  

Could you would you please send me your XFace header

I know Ill probably get a little swamped but I can handle it

	I hope
