 Exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
 me all information greatly received

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows a misfeature of the X protocol and a bug in the Xt intrinsics  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the xy position given in
ReparentNotify events  Olwm is structured in such a way that when a window
is popped down the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event 
At this point the Intrinsics notion of the shells location is out of date

If a SetValues is done using the same xy position the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there  However a misfeature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after
wmTimeout has expired  Actually things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the
same

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the xy positioning information
in ReparentNotify events  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5
public fix 20  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details
