Subject XView 30 window positioning problems

I dont seem to be able to get window positions reliably through
the XView xvget function

   x  int xvgetmyframe XVX
   y  int xvgetmyframe XVY

For example if I set XVX  XVY to 5050 the frame comes up
in the correct position with the top left corner the size
handle at 5050 xvget returns 5050 as well But later on
xvget returns 525 without any intervening xvsetmyframe
XV My frame is fitted around a canvas and it turns out
by measuring on the screen that 525 is the position of the
first pixel in my canvas relative to the frames origin What
gives Any help most appreciated

Derek

PS On a related subject is there any way of querying the
window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around
frames etc
