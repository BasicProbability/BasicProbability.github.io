Subject Re XV 300 has escaped

Ive found that I have to add the 8 option for displaying JPEGs
with the new version  For some reason if I dont it goes into
24bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors 
from a 6x6x6 array instead of 256 and looks grainier  Since Im
on the ubiquitous 8bit pseudo color display I would have thought it
could tell that
