Subject REPOST COSEGUI

 
  
this is a repost I like to find out more about this also

 Message Part 2 Text 
The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common
GUI But what does this mean exactly
 
 Do they mean that all COSEcomplient apps will have the Motif
  look and feel
 
 Do they mean that all COSEcomplient apps will use the Motif
  toolkit API
 
 Do they mean both of the above
 
 Is it possible that there will be a MotifAPI complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look  Feel
 
 How about an OLITXViewOIInterviews API toolkit with a Motif L  F
  I know OI already does this but will this be considered COSEcomplient
 
 Will there be more than one standard toolkit API or L  F supported
 
 How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif
 
This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much
knowledge about these questions off the net Feel free to email
or followup
