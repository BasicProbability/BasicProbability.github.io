Hi

Personally I like NeXTSTEP very much Even more when I realise how much a  
burden ordinary X or Windows programming is I also like ObjectiveC better  
than I like C

But sometimes the restrictions are there For instance it sometimes has to be  
MSWindows or X Now Im looking for pointers to tools on those environments  
that come close to NeXTSTEP the appkit etc Also environs that support rapid  
prototyping like with IB without producing spaghetticode as soon as you want  
to do real work

Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects Interviews  
what it is exactly I dont know I kind of lost touch with that world when I  
started with NeXTSTEP

Thanks
