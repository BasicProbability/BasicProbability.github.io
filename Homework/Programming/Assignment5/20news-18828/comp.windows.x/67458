Subject preventing user from hitting CTRLALTBKSP to exit X

Hello

	I am admin for an RS6000 running AIX 32 X11R5 Motif and xdt3
	I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTLALTBKSPC to exit X
	
	Ive tried invoking X with xinit T but that doesnt work
	xinit appends the T to the call to xinitrc and not to the
	call to X  

	The man page to xinit is no help  In fact it tells
	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file  

	So far the only way Ive been able to accomplish this feat is
	to add the T to the call to X in usrlppX11defaultsxserverrc
	I would rather not do it this way  Does anyone have any other ideas
