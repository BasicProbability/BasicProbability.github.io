Subject Re XV 300 has escaped


 It is interesting to look at the changes of mind that John has had

Very interested indeed This is against this kind of changes that the GNU
COPYLEFT is protecting us

Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv We were using it mostly for slide
shows because of its loop feature that display does not have display
from the wonderful ImageMagick package D but I think I will implement
it myself even a shellscript should do the job and forget xv

Cheers
