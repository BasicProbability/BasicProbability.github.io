Wasnt the shareware fee a suggestion by John

Its a request to personal users its a requirement for commercial
government and institutional users

Someone else asked whether the authors of the JPEG and TIFF software had
given permission to incorporate their code into a commercial product  I
found the following in jpegREADME

    We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
    basis of commercial products provided that all warranty or liability
    claims are assumed by the product vendor

and the following in tiffCopyright

    Permission to use copy modify distribute and sell this software and
    its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee 

Looks like hes OK on that account
