My question is this  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock andor NumLock is

I dont know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
Keypress event  Of course if there is some reason why you need to
always know the state of modifiers even if your windows dont have the
keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root
window  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have
been pressed

An even more pointed question Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard  ie CapsLock is active and the user
presses shifta Id like to get a lowercase a instead of A

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString
You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses
as you like  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from
the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit
