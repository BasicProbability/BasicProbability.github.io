Subject GUI tools

We are making a transition from NextStep to Xwindows I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same each salesman will beg to differ I realize that there are differences but I dont have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are The tools I have looked at so far are UIMX Xdesigner TeleUse tcltkInterviews and SUIT 
So far Ive drawn the following conclusions

1 The builder for Interviews is not very mature bad docs
2 TeleUse is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit
3 UIMX  Xdesigner seem about the same even though Xdesigner does not have a interpreter Ill by Centerline if I need one
4 tcltk is a little buggy
5 I know very little about the ICS Builder just have the sales info
6 Due to a corporate agreement Xdesigner is much cheeper than any other comercial product
7 For the time Im spending I could have bought all of them well different money
8 We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work
9 this type of tool seems great but noone seems to talk about them on the net Is there another news group for this 
10 SUIT cost too much for comercial development

Im hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products

thanks
