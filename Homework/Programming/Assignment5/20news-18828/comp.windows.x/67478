Subject xdm and env vars

Hi

I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 
SunOS 411  Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment
variables like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc in my login file  With xdm
the login file doesnt get executed and therefore neither the olwm
rootwindow nor my applications know about these variables

I used the DisplayManager0userPath resource in usrlibX11xdmxdmconfig
to succesfully pass the PATH variable  But I am having problems passing anything else  I tried execing HOMElogin in usrlibX11xdmXsession
but that didnt help  I also tried using
	DisplayManagerexportList HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH
which didnt work either

I would appreciate any help on this matter

Thanks in advance
Shash
