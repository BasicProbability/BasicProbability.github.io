Subject Action Translation Table implementation


Hello


Our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows
in a number of applications  We are trying to use action translation
tables to implement this  We have only succeeded by assigning the
translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single
application  The Xt calls we make are included below

It would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation
table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations
and also accomplish it for MULTIPLE applications  If someone could
describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated

Platform Sun Sparc w X11R4  Motif 114
