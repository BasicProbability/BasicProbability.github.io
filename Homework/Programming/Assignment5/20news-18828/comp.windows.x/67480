What sort of traffic is generated with the Xcalls  I am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have  if one machine running
DVX is supporting multiple users clients and we require adequate response
time  Anyone have any ideas   

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine not the network
itself To give you a realworld example here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes novell
file servers and each other Its not too much of a load on our
Ethernet with maybe 4 concentrators so you have 2030 people on each
segment If you had a badly loaded net or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive you could run into some slowdowns

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card If you have
10 people running programs off it youre going to see some slowdowns
because youre now on effectively a 33 MHz 486 Of course DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice but if you have 10 working programs running youll know it


Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year  The link I want to use 
though ISDN 64K is costly and the bandwidth limited  Thats why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it

Since I dont think Tom always gets time to read this group Ill take the
liberty of responding to some of this  If you really want Tom to reply
you should send mail to supportqdeckcom

A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps
ethernet that we typically run  How restrictive it will be depends on 
what you run and how you run it  I would think that a couple of instances
of some really nasty program like Smoking Clover would make the link 
useless for anyone else  On the other hand probably 50 xclocks quietly
updating every 10 seconds or so wouldnt impact it too much  In the real
world you will be somewhere in between these two extremes

Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis I wouldnt want to have
to share that 64k link with more than 34 other people

Having said that if you can tweak the programs being run by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing you could probably run 1520 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again this time from network bandwidth

Hmmm  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all  Are you
running any standard MSWindows programs like Word   What sort of 
packets go blazing through What size link do you have 2Mb or 10Mb 
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other  The usage patterns are not very
good predictors of how yours will behave  The only one of our low bandwidth
links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they
often use to run a DOS text based client end of a clientserver database 
remotely from the DVX machine behind me Since the server end is or was always
at this end California it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview
X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having
a long hop to the server  As I warned you this tells us very little about
how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link

Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent
Lets break it into pieces and look at it  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy
and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X Popping up a menu is a
little more involved and will generate some traffic  Restoring the screen
that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be  Does the server
that its displaying on have backing store  If so and the server had enough
memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network
traffic If no backing store then what was being covered up  If it was a 
solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite
easily  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren  Stimpy we may have to send
it back to the X server bit by bit  DVX will do its level best to only redraw
that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be 
repainted  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel thats 3145728 bits
that has to be sent  Worst possible case youre looking at about 50 seconds
In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts 
that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls



It all really depends on what the programs are doing ie youre going
to see a slowdown from Xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also
 

What do you mean by network things  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DVX protocol in transferring these 
images with Xcalls and displaying them on a clients machine

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network  Its 
pretty good for this  X programs are best DOS text programs are almost
as good since we conert them to X easily  Something like WinX is a hybrid
We intercept the calls Windows makes to its graphics driver mouse driver
keyboard driver and convert them to X  The calls Windows is making are in
no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network  We go to a 
lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can but
we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications
tell us
