Subject Efficient PC Clients

Were looking at various X11 clients for PCs and were looking for some
information about the relative efficiency of different products  Are any
notably efficient fast  Are any notably inefficient  I assume that a
Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster right now Im looking
at ico running on Xoftware32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCPIP
platform and its not surprisingly much slower than ico running on the
Sparc10s console  What are the key ways of improving performance for
PC presumably Windows clients

Also what about async solutions  Yes I appreciate that it will be 
much slower even with V42bis  Im in the process of installing PPP
with header compression  How does that compare to cslip  Ive seen
a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient but
are there comparable products out there  If were looking for efficiency
for async PC clients what should we be looking at in addition to standard
PPP w compression and XRemote

Any information would be greatly appreciated  Im still taking in all
the information in the faq but any tips about the relative efficiency
of various product offerings would be great  I get the impression
that discussions about speed are largely application specific but
that not withstanding any comments would be appreciated  Thanks
