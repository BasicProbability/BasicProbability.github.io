 Wasnt the shareware fee a suggestion by John
 Is so then its up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
 honour it and part with money  Personally if I was in his position I would
 do exactly the same thing John has obviously put in lot of time and effort
 into xv and why shouldnt he receive some money for it
 
 Just my pennies worth
 
 Keep up the good work John

The fee is a suggestion for an individual but licensing is mandatory
for commercial government and institutional users I wonder how many
users of xv own the system that it runs on
