 I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 
 SunOS 411  Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment
 variables like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc in my login file  With xdm
 the login file doesnt get executed and therefore neither the olwm
 rootwindow nor my applications know about these variables

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your everytime shell rcfile
instead of your loginonly one which is fair enough if you only have a few
users who know what theyre doing  If you have several hundred users who do
what the books tell them though then its confusing at best  Another is to
have your xterms run login shells but that still leaves the window manager
and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment

Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts
it runs the users favourite shell as a login shell and has it then run the
rest of the startup scripts  That way the users usual environment gets set
up as normal and inherited by everything  You can find an almostcurrent copy
of our scripts and things in contribedinburghenvironmenttarZ available
from the usual places
