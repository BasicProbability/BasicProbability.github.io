Subject Re X Design choice for color handling question

In article lu1oftINNnfkcascaiscsutexasedu siroshcsutexasedu Joseph Sirosh writes

Why did X designers decide to not associate
the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the
display it is being drawn on

In X10 the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
requests  that is the servers drawing model was stateless

This caused problems with performance and network traffic
so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify
the drawing state  Most application designers who want to
draw things in several different colors create a GC for
each color during initialization then pass the GC id in
each drawing request

in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics
