  It is interesting to look at the changes of mind that John has had
 
 Very interested indeed This is against this kind of changes that the GNU
 COPYLEFT is protecting us
 
 Anyway at SIMULOG we will abandon xv We were using it mostly for slide
 shows because of its loop feature that display does not have display
 from the wonderful ImageMagick package D but I think I will implement
 it myself even a shellscript should do the job and forget xv

We too will have to stop using it Shame really  it was rather nice
Still I have no objection to the owner claiming money for legit 
work hes put in Well just go back to the older versions of Xv
