Subject Re Encapsulated Postscript and X


 How do I view eps files on X I have an image in color encapsulated
 postscript and need to view it on my screen

	Several ways are available  pageview which I think came
with our system so I cant point ghostview with ghostscript and
the new xv 300 package all do so  I recommend the latter two
especially xv if you want to do any conversion

 Are there any utilities that will let me convert between encapsulated
 postscript and plain postscript
	Im not sure offhand but I will attempt to mail you the
complangpostscript FAQ which has a list of utilities
