Subject chars of big fonts are shown partially

Hi all

I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window
to show some drawings This works perfectly for all kind of objects
expect large fonts What happens on the screen is that the right
half of the font is not shown The way I create these things is
quite simple some aggregated code

XFillRectangleDisp Pixs AnyColor 0 0 Width Height
XDrawLineRectString
XCopyAreaDisp Pixs Win 0 0 Width Height 0 0

I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 32

The question is
  is this a bug in the AIX Xserver may be some PTFs or did I do
  something wrong within my code

Sorry for the crossposting but I really do not know what kind of
error it is
