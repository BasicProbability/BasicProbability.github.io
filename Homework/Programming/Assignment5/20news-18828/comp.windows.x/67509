Subject Re X Design choice for color handling question


In article lu1oftINNnfkcascaiscsutexasedu siroshcsutexasedu Joseph Sirosh writes
 Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify
 a color for drawing like
 
 Drawpointxycolor or Drawlinex1y1x2y2color or
 Fillrectanglex1y1x2y2color 
 
 With X I have to do something like 
 XSetForegroundcurrentcolor
 XDrawPointdwxy
 
 Why split this into two functions Why did X designers decide to not associate
 the color with the object being drawn and instead associate it with the
 display it is being drawn on

For flexibility Anyway what you say is not really true The color information
is associated with a GraphicsContext not with a display and the GC IS
a parameter to the drawing routines

So if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of
width 2 you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do

XDrawLinedpywingcredx1y1x2y2
XDrawLinedpywingcbluex3y3x4y4

for this effect

This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer but also much
more efficient and flexible You would not include all the other parameters
like line pattern with cap and joinstyle drawmode and so on in every
drawing call so why do it for color  BTW stay away from XDrawPoint
if you dont really need it to draw RANDOM points for image transfers
there are Image routines
