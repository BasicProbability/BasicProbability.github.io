Subject Re Encapsulated Postscript and X


EPS IS plain postscript It is only wrapped by some comments and stripped
of any dubious commands for compatibility You can simply do



save gsave
showpage  def

 Include eps file here

grestore restore

showpage

 end of file

and this way show it on its natural page position and size

Programs may use the BoundingBox comment in the EPS file to do
arbitrary scale rotate and translate to include it in more complicated
ways than above
