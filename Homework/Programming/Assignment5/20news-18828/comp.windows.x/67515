Subject Re XV 300 has escaped


  Commercial government and institutional users MUST register their
  copies of XV for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just 25 per
  workstationX terminal  Site licenses are available for those who
  wish to run XV on a large number of machines  Contact the author
  for more details


I would have appreciated an announcement of the policy change  
Dartmouth will not be able to run xv 30 and Im probably going 
to have to take v2 off line I somehow missed the shareware
designation in the README of v2 and didnt realize that we were
supposed to register

I also debate whether this with the new institutions must pay
policy belongs in the contrib directory on export  to me contrib
means contributed ie no strings except copyright attached
