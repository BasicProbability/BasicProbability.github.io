Subject Multiple Heads on Sparc2

I have a SPARC2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it  Id like
to have the R5 server recognize the second card


I mknod created a devcgsix1 device but when I brought up the
server the second device was ignored  

How do I setup the second card


Note  If I borrow a cgthree card and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same SPARC2 box the R5 server finds
the second card I then set the DISPLAY to the
second card and start a second window manager  

Worse case is I trade cards with someone but maybe someone
out there has seen this problem already


email is preferred post if you must

Thanks in advance


Jim
