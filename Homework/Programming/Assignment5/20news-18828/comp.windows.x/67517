 Hello
 
 We want to configure our X11R5 sytem i486 33Mhz running BSDlike UNIX
 comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it works an then
 connect to them But the only connection works is localhost
 An X indirect machine works very well
 The configuration
 
 		 starting the xdm at boot time with no servers specified
 		   in Xservers
 		 starting the Xserver at boot time with X indirect localhost
 
            more deleted


You need to start the Xserver with indirect itsname

If you start it with indirect localhost it use the loopback adress as
its adress So when it try to contact another host this one try to answer
on its loopback adress Not good

Remember that every machine has the adress 127001 on the loopback network
