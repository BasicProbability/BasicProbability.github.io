Subject Re Cannot create 24 plane window summary


 I got several answers the most complete was from Errol Crary 
 errolctvtvTekcom
 I have just looked at the R4 server listings mitserverdixwindowc 
 and there are several ways in which you can get a BadMatch error even
 though my OReilly book only says BorderWidth is nonzero for InputOnly

As of the third edition June 92 the OReilly book Vol 2 under
XCreateWindow says

BadMatch
	Any invalid setting of a window attribute
	Attribute besides wingravity eventmask donotpropogatemask
	    overrideredirect or cursor specified for InputOnly window
	depth nonzero for InputOnly
	Parent of InputOutput is InputOnly
	borderwidth is nonzero for InputOnly
	depth or visual invalid for screen
	width or height is 0
