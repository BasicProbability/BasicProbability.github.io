Greetings

I am developing an application that allows a user to interactively
createeditview a visual model ie topology of their network and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task

In the past I have used Visual Edges UIMX product to develop other
GUIs so I am familiar with UIMSs in general

The topology will support objects and connecting links  Once the
topology is created I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping zooming etc

I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this  Specifically the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult and certainly time consuming  if I have
to roll my own

Suggestions

You dont mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget NetEd 
which does exactly what you want to do Cost is nominal 300 or so  call your
local office  The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard
rumblings of porting to Sun etc so it may be worth the check
