Subject Porting Athena Widgets to Xview

I checked the FAQ on this first and no luck


I need to convert the R5 Tree widget for use with xview v30 The
problem is the fact that xview uses their own event loop system and I
was wondering if anyone had any tips or converted source on converting
these pups


Thanks
