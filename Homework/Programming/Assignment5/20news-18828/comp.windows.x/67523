Subject XArchie 201 Icon problems


Hi Ive just installed the new XArchie 201 and it all works
fine except

on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
program dont work at all but on the BW terminal it works fine
I can set the icon to an xbm file with twmrc but that doesnt
give the neato change when busy action Other programs with
similar actions eg xmail xbiff work fine

The Xinterface author George Ferguson suggests it might be a
problem with the X intrinsics but isnt willing to hack around
to fix it himself But I know zero about X programming so I
dont think I can find it 

Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem

Andrew
