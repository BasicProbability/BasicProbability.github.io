Im trying to get MH compiled and then xmh and Im having some problems
Ive got mh68 using gcc on SCO 324  My MH file is listed below  Does
anyone have any suggestions on what I can add to get it to compile



bin             usrlocalbin

cc              gcc
ccoptions       O ansi DSTDC0 DSYSV DSYSV386 DSCO DSVID

	I think the traditional option to gcc would help
	personally I used traditional O2 funrollloops to compile it
	on SUN411

	hope this helps
