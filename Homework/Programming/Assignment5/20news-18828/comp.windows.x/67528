Subject Pixmap standard


Our group is interested in using a pixmap format for multicolored
iconsbuttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from
resource files Using pbmplus we can easily move tofrom Xpm to our other
environments of MSWindows and OS2 PM  We were wondering if Xpm or some
other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X
consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by
X 

Along the same subject line is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used
because it doesnt have an associated colormap and other attributes or is it
more involved just wondering why there arent editors for pixmaps out there
for the original format

Email replies preferred Thanks in advance
