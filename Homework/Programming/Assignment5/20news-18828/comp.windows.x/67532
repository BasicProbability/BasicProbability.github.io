Subject Help with XClearArea

Hi 
	Could some please tell me the errors of my ways 
	I am trying to update a drawable This drawable 
	happens to be a Pixmap on a button 
	
	The problem is that after I do the 
XClearAreaXtDisplaymusr0XtWindowmusr0 80 8 40 40 True

	This appears to work I then do

sprintftmpstrRdfun
XDrawStringXtDisplaymusr0 bmaps0 mygc 78 10 tmpstr strlentmpstr 

	The problem is that the new info is drawn but the old info is
	still there Even if I pass XClearArea a False and see it clear
	when it redraws the new info the old info is still there


Help Please
        Thanks
