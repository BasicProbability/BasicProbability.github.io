You may want to use a different locking style my mailbox is mounted over NFS
so I use fcntlstyle locking

I also applied the following tweak to sbrmakedirc

  include systypesh
  include sysstath
  endif         SYS5DIR 
 if definedSVR4  definedncr
  include unistdh
  endif

 2431 
  include systypesh
  include sysstath
  endif         SYS5DIR 
 if definedSVR4  definedncr  definedSYS5
 define MAXPATHLEN 1024
  include unistdh
  endif

That took care of everything but the man pages which I installed by hand

Good luck
 Steve
