Subject using XTERM to display output 

Hello I am writing a program which forks of a number of child processes
and each of the children printing things on the screen quite messy in
one window 

The xterm  Sxxd  option seems to be the solution to opening up
slave windows only to display output and I use the following code to
open up a pty taken from Stevensand manage to open up an xterm
successfully 

The problem however is how do I write into this xterm  Please help


static char ptyname12
int ptymaster void 

int ptymaster void 

  int ifd
  char ptr
  struct stat statbuff
  static char ptychar  pqrs
  static char hexdigit  0123456789abcdef
  
  for ptr  ptychar ptr0 ptr  
    strcpy ptyname devttyXY 
    ptyname8  ptr
    ptyname9  0
    
    if stat ptyname statbuff  0 
      break

    for i0 i  16 i  
      ptyname9  hexdigiti
      if fd  open ptyname ORDWR   0 
	return fd 
    
  
  return1
