Subject X server only on Sun

I have been using a HDS Xterminal and really like it What
is really powerful is that it can run the X server without
running a window manager One can then run a special client
X program called a window manager either 1 run 
motif or openlook from its own firmware limiting the network
traffic  but having no HOME or 2 run motif or openlook
from some home place like a sparc or vms

This is powerful especially since I can exit one window manager
without killing windows and then start up another manager
Some of my VMS tools need special metamouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other

Well the question is

  On a sparcstation running openlook does anyone know how to
  break apart olwm from the olwmslave program Basically I
  want to run only the server and go somewhere else to run
  the window manager


Please respond my email as well as posting because of the
large volumes in windowX

Thanks
