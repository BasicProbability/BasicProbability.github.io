Hi

I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 
SunOS 411  Prior to using xdm I used to set PATH and other environment
variables like MANPATH HELPPATH ARCH etc in my login file  With xdm
the login file doesnt get executed and therefore neither the olwm
rootwindow nor my applications know about these variables

I always use the following in my tcshrc


f  LOGIN  0  then
   source homelogin
endif


and in login


setenv LOGIN 1


So I dont need to set all environment variables in my cshrc but they get
set if I login via xdm or xon  xrsh  rx and so on

Hope this helps

Bernward
