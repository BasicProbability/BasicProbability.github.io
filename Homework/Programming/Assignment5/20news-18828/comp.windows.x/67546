Subject Resolution bitmapped fonts device independence

I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing
usrlibX11xdmXservers from
0 local usrbinX11X 0 ar1 500 dpi 100
to
0 local usrbinX11X 0 ar1 500 dpi 85

I determined that my 19 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the
active screen area and dividing by resolution

However this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely
After some research I believe this is caused by my applications
requesting fonts by Family Weight Slant and Pointsize  I believe
that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
and displaying it  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my
path the results are inaccurate  I do have some Speedo fonts but
not for the family I am using Helvetica

I think this is incorrect  The fonts should always be provided in the
resolution of the display  This never seems to happen unless you
explicitly request fonts by xres and yres  This is true of both the
scaleable and bitmapped fonts  For instance the command

xfd fn bitstreamcharter240

Will invoke a 75dpi font despite the fact that this is a Speedo font

The command  

xfd fn adobecourier240

Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font depending on my font path
Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi and that it can
generate an 85dpi font for me  Unless I my applications specifies a
resolution X appears to pick a stupid default

Is this a bug  Is it a feature  If so why  Is there anything I can
do to get around this problem  People have suggested that I lie about
my resolution and specify a single font path 75 or 100 not both
This would at least make my app consistent but I like being able to
look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say Yup thats
an inch  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use
