Subject Xw widget set ported to X11R5

Im trying to compile xftp which uses the Xw widget set and Im having
problems  Were using Motif and X11R5 and it seems that my version of the
Xw stuff was only ported to R3  Are there patches out to port this to R5
or a newer port altogether

Or perhaps a newer port of xftp for use with R5
Thanks in advance
