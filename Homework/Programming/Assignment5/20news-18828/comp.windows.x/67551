Subject Hummingbird Software Query

Hello

  I am considering buying the Hummingbird XWindows software for a MSWindows
31 PC 38640MHZ NE2000 Ethernet board  Would anyone tell me if they
are using this package in a similar environment and if they are happy with
it  I will be connecting to Sun SparcStation 10 running Sun OS 413

Thanks very much
