Subject Re Animation with XPutImage

 Hi Im new to this group so please bear with me
 
 Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete Ive
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView
 I put together a quick test and Ive found that XPutImage
 is considerably slower factor of 2 on average than the
 Sunview command pwrop which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas This was on a Sparc IPX It seems that
 1 the X protocol communication is slowing things down or
 2 XPutImage is inefficientor both My question is what
 is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
 a window Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server Or am I stuck with
 XPutImage in which case I might as well give up now
 
 All help appreciatedthanks

The fastest way is to use an X server with shared memory extension It uses
shared memory if it is a local X server hence images dont have to be duplicated
and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension
is not available or if its  not the localhost
