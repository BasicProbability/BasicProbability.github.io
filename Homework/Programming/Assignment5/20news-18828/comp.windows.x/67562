Subject X Meta File Anyone

Hi

Im working on a project that involves storing an applications rendering
to an X display and then playing it back again  Rather than 
reinvent the wheel it like to find
	 a file format for saving X protocol
	 software that saves and replays such a session

Any ideas out there  Ive heard that there is a version of Xscope
that will save and replay sessions

Id be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community
