Is there a tn3270 program which support xterm I dont like x3270 at all You
cant copy with other windows Thanks

The x3270 at exportlcsmitedu supposedly does  I use another x3270
that was cleaned up by Brian Ward wardmathpsuedu which adds better
color support and cleans up lots of bugs as well as cutpaste
I just put it on exportlcsmitedu as x3270v265betatarZ
