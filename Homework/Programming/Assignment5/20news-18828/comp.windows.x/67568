For all those people flaming John Bradley the author of xv  hes on
vacation till May 10 or 15 I dont remember Maybe we all should slow
down and wait to hear his side wrt copyrights fees etc

While I have respect for Johns ability and integrity I really regret his
leaving just after a major release or more accurately making the release
just before leaving  Several of us are having problems with xv300 and
in particular I have issues with all the fixes that have so far been made
to the Imakefiles and xvh  Without John to adjudicate and everybody
posting fixes that work for them chaos is inevitable lets hope it is
temporary
