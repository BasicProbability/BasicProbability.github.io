Subject Re XV 300 has escaped

Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or
modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice I would
say that the shareware notice is unenforceable  All you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice  Of course this would be
circumventing the authors wishes on the subject but Id say if youre
not going to pay him no matter what youd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach  In fact given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices Id guess none of it could ever be enforced but not being
a lawyer I cant be positive

Regardless the fees hes asking are not excessive and I would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible  Even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the
author it would be reasonable to do so to support his efforts if nothing
else
