Special Notes
     I have not updated this FAQ for the recentlyannounced OpenWindows 4
      due to ship later this year
     Yes Sun is moving to Motif along with all of COSE  But the Motif to
      which they move will be a new Motif with some of the OPEN LOOK UI
      features added
     Yes OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS  NeWS is dead
      This means TNT is dead too
     XView and OLIT will be supported but probably not enhanced after the
      next release  I dont know if there will be a source release of
      XView 31 or not
     The COSE Environment will include at least some of Suns DeskSet
      ported to Motif  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool at least
     Yes the new Mailtool will be MIMEcompliant

Subject Terminology OPEN LOOK OpenWindows X11 XView OLIT MOOLIT Motif

 What is OPEN LOOK
    OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface GUI
    A GUI determines the look and feel of a system  the shape of
    windows buttons and scrollbars how you resize things how you
    edit files etc

    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified developed and maintained jointly by
    Sun Microsystems and ATT or USL

    See Also
	Bibliography

 What is OpenWindows
    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK
    Graphical User Interface Specifications  Its compatible with the
    X11 window system from MIT as well as currently Suns NeWS and SunView
    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems
    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors
    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews after the
    program used to start it and the main executable itself respectively
    It should not be called Windows or OPEN LOOK or OpenLook as
    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else
    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about 5000 for the server
    plus about 25000 for DeskSet and another 40000 for ToolTalk
    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are
	SunOS 411 on Sun 3 20
	Solaris 1x SunOS 41x on SPARC 30
	Solaris 20 SunOS 5 on SPARC 301

	Where can I get it

 What are OLIT XView and TNT
    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs
    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications  See the Bibliography
    for documentation on the individual toolkits  Heres a brief summary

    OLIT was ATTs OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system
    it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were
    already X11Xt programmers to learn  You could buy the source from ATT
    although you didnt get the same version tht Sun ship  Sun includes the
    OLIT library in OpenWindows qv it is also often included in
    System V Release 4  It was written in C  The release of OLIT in
    OpenWindows 30 was OLIT 30  OLIT support passed to USL then a
    division of ATT now owned by Novell who replaced it with MoOLIT qv
    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing you will probably
    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or
    anything else that uses subclasses
    see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference

    XView is Suns toolkit for X11 written in C  XView is similar in
    programmer interface to SunView  Theres even a shell script to help
    migrate source code from SunView to XView	 XView is often said to be
    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows
    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows and full source is
    available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu and elsewhere
    The current version of XView from Sun is 30
    Despite rumours to the contrary  some even from within Sun  the
    XView toolkit is NOT about to be dropped by Sun  XView will be
    included in the next release of OpenWindows unlike NeWS
    On the other hand the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much
    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT

    The NeWS Toolkit TNT was an objectoriented programming system based
    on the PostScript language and NeWS  TNT implements many of the
    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of
    an application  Its currently included in OpenWindows

    The current version of TNT from Sun is 31 Release 3 contains some
    incompatibilities with tNt 10 and TNT 20 but Sun are committed to
    supporting the API at least until they stop NeWS support some time
    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript  Wail
    You might ask what is committed to means in this context the
    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing
    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT however

    The C User Interface Toolkit UIT consists of an objectoriented C
    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from
    DevGuide 3 GIL files  The UIT also includes features that simplify
    event management and the use of PostScript and color  It is said to be
    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3 and presumably V301 since the
    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2
    UIT is not an official Sunsupported product but an ongoing project of
    various people within Sun  It can be found on exportlcsmitedu in
    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2tarZ use binary mode

 Where does Motif fit in
    It doesnt   Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that
    is being developed by OSF	It has a look and feel reminiscent of
    Microsoft Windows and the OS2 Presentation Manager  There are no non
    commercial Motif toolkits available although the Motif source is sold
    reasonably cheaply by OSF	Although Motif is currently available on
    more platforms than OpenWindows the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly
    used on many more machines simply because Sun and SysVR4 have such a
    large installed base
    Suns CDWARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif
    applications by converting them to OLIT  there are also notes in
    the Periodic Table OLIT demo OPENWINHOMEdemoolittable

 What is MoOLIT
    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from ATTUSL that lets users choose between
    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at runtime  It will be part of System V
    Release 42
    Contact Joanne Newbauer jouslcom 908 5226677

 What about that Display PostScript thing
    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X
    in the next release of OpenWindows  DPS is essentially a badly designed
    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a
    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously
    being harder to use as I understand it  The only real advantage it
    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller being generally less
    complete DPS is also available on more kinds of machine
    Performance on our RS6000 is not suitable for interactive work
    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen
    Note that whereas XNeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems the DPS
    extension to X does not make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to
    ordinary X11 programs  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard
    there is at least one thirdparty version which does make fonts
    available however

Subject Window Managers  olwm olvwm

 What are olwm and olvwm
    They are window managers  A window manager is the part of the X Window
    system eg X11 that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows
    on the screen and for managing the users interaction with the windows

    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager
    Its included with all of the OpenWindows qv implementations and
    you can also get the source by ftp since Sun donated it

    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop hence the
    v in its name  It shows a little map on the screen with the
    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle	 You can
    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys  This
    lets you run several clients applications and move the display around
    from one to the other  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 30 olwm
    by Scott Oaks you need to have XView 30 to compile it
    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as exportlcsmitedu in the contrib
    directory there are three patches

 Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm
    Yes  If you use twm for example or mwm you wont be able to use
    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm and you probably wont see the
    footers some windows use to display certain messages

    If you use twm youll want to use the fdelete function to unpin menus
    and get rid of programs that dont have a quit button when not run
    under olwm
    For twm put this in your HOMEtwmrc
	LeftTitleButton target  fdelete
    where target is a 16x16 icon from usrincludeX11bitmaps
    Alternatively try
	 Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm
	LeftTitleButton menu  fmenu OLmenu

	menu OLmenu 
	    Quit         fdelete
	

    For mwm you can doubleclick on the menu icon on the left of the title
    bar to dismiss a popup window I am told

    See the manual page for your window manager twm etc

Subject OpenWindows Terminals and Other Displays

 Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal
    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView NeWS PostScript and X11
    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems
    Unfortunately it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS
    or SunView support and thus wont run on an X terminal  This includes
    pageview in particular

    You can use olwm or olvwm see above on an X terminal or a nonOpen
    Windows display and most OPEN LOOK clients eg OLIT or XView ones
    will work perfectly well  You may find that you get complaints about
    fonts not being found  If so see the Fonts section below
    If you are running the window manager builtin to an NCD terminal you
    may have problems with input focus setting Input True in the terminals
    XDefault file in usrlibX11xdm may or may not help


Subject Configuration Files Getting started with OpenWindows
     
 What configuration files do I need to know about

    xinitrc and xsessionrc

    The first time you run OpenWindows a xinitrc file will be created in
    your login directory HOME  If it already exists you might have to
    edit it somewhat its simplest to move it and any other old X11 files
    you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files

    If your site uses xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc
    since xdm doesnt look at your xinitrc file

    openwininit openwinmenu and openwinsys

    These are optional files you can create in your HOME directory
    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use
    Look in OPENWINHOMElib normally usropenwinlib for these files
    without the leading  and copy any you want to change  You may need
    to edit your xinitrc to get them recognized  If you are not on an
    X terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool C
    shelltool C xterm C or Chuck Muscianos contool program so that
    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen
    Note that openwinsys is not executed unless you edit xinitrc

    Xdefaults

    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here  In particular
    it is a good idea to include at least
	OpenWindowsFocusLenience	true
	Input TRUE
    These allow nonICCCMcompliant programs to receive input even if they
    forget to ask for it

    Props the program that runs when you select properties from the default
    root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into Xdefaults
    Dont put comments in Xdefaults since props deletes them

    startupps

    This is the NeWS user profile file read by OpenWindows actually xnews
    on startup	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual near the
    back  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change
    the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a
    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up
    at all or will get broken in strange ways	The NeWS manual gives code
    that is both incorrect and insufficient
    WARNING things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3

    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your xinitrc with xset m see
    the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information

    Heres what HOMEstartupps  should look like if you want a delay of
    about a third of a second 300000 microseconds and a repeat rate of
    twenty or so keys per second 30000 microseconds between repeats for
    OpenWindows 3  Youll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime
    is the delay between keys sent and thus doesnt include the time to
    process each key which is probably higher on my 4110 than on your
    SuperSPARC 1051 GTi injection   Again this is for OpenWindows 3

	 dont want the demos  see p xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual
	 IncludeDemos false def

	UserProfile begin
	    KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def
	    KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def
	     Note 300000 and 30000 differ greatly
	end

    You must also have a userps file in the same directory like this

	NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
	TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
	TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage

	ClassRepeatKeys pop	 force repeatps to autoload

	endpackage endpackage endpackage

    If you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the
    OpenWindows server like this
	 psh i startupps
	Welcome to X11NeWS Version3
	 psh i
	Welcome to X11NeWS Version3
	classinit ClassRepeatKeys send
	 now press controlD

    You can also either of these two files startupps and userps to make
    the root window be retained so that a PostScript drawing on the
    background wont be erased when you move windows
	frambuffer Retained true put
    will do this  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used
    by the NeWS server xnews dramatically

 How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a lefthanded mouse and keyboard
    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one
    or two occasional surprises  See also man 7 xview for a list of
    keybindings you can change at least for XView programs

    With OpenWindows 20 you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings
    and then let SunView handle them  The status returned by svenv should
    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not put this
    in your xinitrc

    if eval svenv env
    then
	xmodmap e pointer  1 2 3
	inputfromdefaults
    else
	xmodmap e pointer  3 2 1
    fi


 How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle

    Run screenblank from etcrclocal if you can its a boring but
    effective screen saver  See man screenblank
    Under Solaris 2 youll need to copy screenblank from an older system as
    its not supplied  Then add a new file in etcrc2d to make the system
    run screenblank automatically

Subject Key Bindings Cut and Paste

 How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs

    To go from XTerm to textedit say
     Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button
      in xterm
     Press COPY in the XTerm this key is L6 or Metac the OReilly
      XView manual gets this wrong
     Move to the textedit window and press PASTE L8 or Metav

    If this doesnt work see Trouble Shooting Cut and Paste

   To go the other way from textedit to XTerm
     Select the text in textedit  No need to use COPY
     Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST the middle mouse button
     You can also use the COPYCUT and PASTE buttons

 COPYPASTE is boring	 What shortcuts are available

    Quick Copy within textedit mailtool etc
     Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go
     Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE or CUT button
     Select the text you want to copymove  Youll see that its underlined
      or crossed out as appropriate  In the jed demo it goes grey
     Let go of the PASTE or CUT button
     The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret

    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection
     Select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple
      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button
     Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection
     Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button and move the mouse
      pointer a little to the right youll see the cursor changes to be the
      first 3 letters of the text or some other icon
     Still holding SELECT down move the mouse over the point where you want
      to drop the text
     You may see the mouse pointer change to a riflesight or target to show
      that its OK to drop things here
     Let go of SELECT and the text is moved	This works in text fields of
      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows

    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection
     This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection except that
      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button

 What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere

    See the man page for textedit1 for some of them
    In general the editingmoving commands go in the opposite direction when
    shifted  eg Ctrlw deletes a word and CtrlW deletes the word to the
    right of the insert point

	Metai  include file	    Metaf  find selection forwardbackward

	Ctrla  start of line	    Ctrl  back word
	Ctrle  end of line	    Ctrl  forward word
	Ctrlw  delete word	    Ctrlu  delete to startEND of line
	CtrlReturn  move to endSTART of document

    See the OReilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default
    keys see also the olwm or olvwm manual page

 What can I put in my ttysrc	 Where is it documented

    See the manual page for shelltool

Subject Applications Finding Out
    Contact SunSoft or Sun and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide
    which lists over 200 pages of applications and also the huge
    Catalyst listing of products for Suns updated sixmonthly

    Suns free CDWare CDROMs each contain demo versions of several popular
    OPEN LOOK applications  Often you can simply contact the vendor
    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo and receive the full
    product documentation

    SunPICS produces a CDROM for NeWSPrint users Printers Pallate which
    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters as
    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license

    There is a separate FAQ posting in compwindowsopenlook that lists
    a number of free and commercial aplications mail leesqcom for a
    copy including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a
    faster reply

Subject DeskSet Mailtool Calendar Manager etc

 Is there a ttybased interface to cm Calendar Manager
    Yes cmdelete cminsert and cmlookup these all have manual pages
    If man cmdelete doesnt work or gives strange messages see under
    Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages below

 How can I arrange to have my signature included in my outgoing mail
    The best way is
     cd
     cp usrlibtextswrc 
     chmod w textswrc
    edit textswrc use vi textedit or whatever you prefer
    add the follwing
	KEYRIGHT3    FILTER
	cat signature
    you might need to change  to HOME

    Now pressing R3 will insert your signature file



Subject Fonts

 Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts
    Yes under either Solaris 20 or 21 Im not sure which
    Or Not Yet in other words

    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them Im told
    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted though and
    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is
    interesting  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the
    Sun OpenFonts group listed in the Bibliography below  Documentation on
    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts

    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS Monotype Linotype URW and probably
    other major foundries

    SunPICS NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts

 Improving font rendering time
    Although the Sun type renderer TypeScaler is pretty fast its not as
    fast as loading a bitmap   You can pregenerate bitmap fonts for sizes
    that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache
    parameters	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the
    font cache size
	 psh i
	Welcome to X11NeWS Version3  psh will say this at you
	currentfontmem 	 type this line 
	300	 and heres whai my server was using  300 Kbytes
	1024 setfontmem
	 Just to check
	currentfontmem 
	1024
    See pp 328ff of the NeWS 30 Programmers Guide  You need to say psh i
    so that the PostScript packages are loaded  see the psh man page

 Making bitmap fonts for faster startup
	 mkdir HOMEmyfonts
	 cd HOMEmyfonts
	 makeafb 20 M OPENWINHOMElibfontsBembof3b
	Creating Bembo20afb
	 convertfont b Bembo20afb

	 bldfamily
	 Bembo		       Bemboff Encoding latin
	cat Compatlist No such file or directory
	 xset fp pwd
	 xset fp rehash

    If you want the server to see your new font directory every time
    add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one
    of your startup files eg login or profile

 Converting between font formats convertfont etc
    You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server by converting them to a
    bitmap X11 bdf format first  Your licence forbids you from using the
    fonts on another machine and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldnt
    use them for printing  Having said all that  you can use makeafb and
    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or
    bdftopcf

    Use mftobdf from the SeeTeX distribution to convert TeX pk fonts to
    X11 bdf format which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows

    You can also use der Mouses getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running
    X display server  ftp larrymcrcimmcgilledu 13220611 Xgetbdf

 XviewOLIT fonts at 100 dpi
    There arent any  More precisely the various text fonts such as
    Lucida Typewriter Sans are available at 100 dpi and in fact are
    scalable under OpenWindows	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps and dont
    scale very well

Subject Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages

 No manual entry for cmlookup

    If man doesnt seem to find OpenWindows commands even though you are
    running OpenWindows try setting the MANPATH environment variable
	MANPATHOPENWINHOMEsharemanusrman export MANPATH
    or
	setenv MANPATH OPENWINHOMEsharemanusrman
    for csh users  OPENWINHOME should be usropenwin on most systems

 window Window creation failed to get new fd 
 window Base frame not passed parent window in environment 
 Cannot create base frame  Process aborted 

    These messages all come from SunView programs  SunView was an
    earlier windowing system for Suns and was not networked  Some of
    the SunView programs are still around in usrbin and have names
    that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts  You almost
    certainly want to run the programs in OPENWINHOME instead

    Set your path so that OPENWINHOMEbin and OPENWINbinxview for
    OpenWindows 2 come before bin or usrbin theyre the same or
    youll get the SunView versions of mailtool cmdtool shelltool etc

    on the link ld or cc  o  line  An alternative is to add
	assert nodefinitions
    to CFLAGS in your Makefile or even in Imaketmpl


Subject Trouble Shooting It Wont Let Me Type

 When I try to type into some programs I just get beeps or nothing happens
    It is a good idea to include at least
	OpenWindowsFocusLenience	true
	Input TRUE
    in your Xdefaults file as these allow nonICCCMcompliant programs to
    receive input even if they forget to ask for it
    See the next item for editing Xdefaults

Subject Trouble Shooting Cut and Paste not working

 I cant paste from xterm to XView including Sun DeskSet programs
    Under OpenWindows 2 you need to add the following either to your
    HOMEXdefaults file or to OPENWINHOMElibappdefaultsXTerm instead

	XTermVT100Translations override 
		KeyL6selectsetCLIPBOARDn
		KeyL8insertselectionCLIPBOARD
  
    You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing
    L8 the Paste key

    Under OpenWindows 3 this is already in the appdefaults file so if it
    isnt working check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to
	usropenwinlibTNS
    and if it isnt either set it or copymerge the above lines from
    OPENWINHOMElibappdefaultsXTerm into usrlibX11appdefaultsXTerm
    See also Environment Variables

    This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard
	XTermVT100translations overriden

       KeyReleaseL10 killselection n
    before the KeyPressL8 line will make L10 CUT work as a cut key

    If you alter HOMEXdefaults instead you must use what X calls a
    more specific resource name
	xtermvt100translations
    will do

 I cant paste from XView including Sun DeskSet programs to xterm

    If you dont have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard you can
    use Metax Metac and Metav for cut coy and paste respectively
    You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to
    your Xdefaults file edited as you wish the values shown here are the
    defaults

	OpenwindowsKeyboardCommandCopy cMetaL6
	OpenWindowsKeyboardCommandPaste vMetaL8
    
    Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview and also in the
    thinnish blue book Companion to Volume 7 XView Reference Manual from
    OReilly and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages

 I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE L8 Metav
    Remove the file tmptextswshelf and see if that helps see also the
    next item

 Cut Copy and Paste dont work at all OpenWindows only
    Oh dear  Use ps xuaww  grep xv  to check that svxvselsvc is running
    and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started
    OpenWindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm
    If not start it  If it dies check that there is no tmpsvxvselsvc
    before restarting it  you may need to be root to remove it or you can
    reboot your workstation
    Check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there
    are a lot of files there with names like tmpttytxta01246 if there are
    several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out

    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start
    a terminal emulator and remove and tmpttytxt and tmpText files
    that are still there  Its simplest to quit openwin and start it again
    after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working
    again you can just carry on  Note that files in tmp not owned by you
    might be in use by another worker comrade so dont remove those without
    checking first

Subject Trouble Shooting Not authorized to use display

    If you get error messages that look like
	Xlib  connection to 00 refused by server
	Xlib  Internal error during connection authorization check
	Error Cant Open display
    try on the machine running OpenWindows or X11
	xhost machine
    where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed
    If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you
    using your display you will have to type the bizarrelooking
	xhost hostname
    or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation
    This lets ANY user on happyboy access your display

    With OpenWindows 30 you can also use xauth and the Programmers Guide 
    describes how to do this in Chapter 8 p 101  This is more secure
    Also check the man page for fbtab5 to stop other users accessing the
    framebuffer directly

    Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 30 under SunOS 411
    to fix a serious security problem  It is available through your local
    Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftpuunet
    19248962 system in sundist

    On an X Terminal there may be a setup menu that lets you change or
    disable the list of hosts that can access the display

    If you start getting this message after youve been logged in overnight
    there might be a cron job thats removing the Unix sockets in tmp
    that are used to communicate with the server when DISPLAY doesnt have
    a hostname before the  or is empty  Have the system administrator
    change the cron script to skip sockets

Subject Trouble Shooting other common problems

 I get console error messages on my screen and they dont go away Sun 3 or 4
    If refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later
	you need to run xterm C from your xinitrc or start one up in
	the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the
	WorkspaceUtilities menu  Better still pick up contool and run
	that  Get it from exportlcsmitedu in the contrib directory  It
	will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a
	message appears its very easy to configure

    If refresh from the WorkspaceUtilities menu doesnt make the messages
    go away
	a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens  you can move the
	mouse off the righthand by default edge of the screen and onto
	a whole new but monochrome display called 01  See the man
	page for openwin I have a shell script that checks for this and
	if theres a devcgfour0 does
		openwin dev devcgfour0 dev devbwtwo0
	If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2 you might need to add this
	to your xinitrc or other startup file
	
	    eval svenv display unix01 env
	    olvwm display unix01
	 
	Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically
	You can also run switcher e 0 to get rid of the messages  Also see
	the note about contool above

 Is there an easy way of editing Xdefaults
    Use props which appears in the default root menu as properties
    This starts props a property editor which will rewrite your
    Xdefaults after removing comments  It then applies any changes
    Keep comments by using comment instead of  for example
	commentfont PalatinoItalic37

 How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit
    set the default editor to
	sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter18 FILE
    you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one

 How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video
    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2	 With OpwnWindows 30
    there are various ways including using bg and fg options  If youre
    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3  probably the best you can do short of
    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC is to use xterm instead of cmdtool

 Why dont flat checkboxes work
    A known bug may make Guides output dump core if you use these
    A workaround is to edit the Guide output as its only Guides output
    thats broken not the actual checkbox code
    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 30  If youre
    still using an ancient DevGuide you should upgrade as soon as possible
    the new one is fantastic

 When I leave OpenWindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays
  on the screen
    Try running clearcolormap if this helps put it as the last line in
    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows eg openwin

 When I use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something
    This was a bug related to some systems only  The only workround was to
    use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv 221 or xgrabsc
    
 Why have some of my function keys stopped working
    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXKF36 and SunXKF37
    respectively in OpenWindows 3  Applications must be recompiled or you
    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to
    change your keyboard layout back again

 When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit I get the Sunview version
    See under Trouble Shooting Strange Error Messages below

 Mixing X11 and OpenWindows
    see also next item

    Note that OpenWindows 30 includes the X11R4 core distribution to patch
    level 18 but not the contrib directory  These notes apply to
    OpenWindows 20 although you could also the do same sort of thing with
    OpenWindows 30 and X11R5

    Install the X11 libraries in usrlibX11	You can intermix OpenWindows
    and X11R4 or X11R5 theyre all compatible in this respect
    Put the X11 binaries in for example usrbinX11

    Put usrbinX11 last in your PATH so that you get OpenWindows versions
    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate although this is a
    matter of preference  In any event put the OpenWindows bin directory
    first  see the preceding item for more details on that  If you have
    bin or usrbin theyre the same directory on SunOS earlier in
    your PATH than OPENWINHOMEbinxview youll get SunView programs instead
    of OpenWindows ones

    Set LDLIBRARYPATH so that usropenwinlib is last after the X11
    library directory	This doesnt matter with OpenWindows 30 but with
    older versions youll get error messages from X11 programs if you dont
    do this  The messages are generally harmless see next item although
    xdm core dumps if this isnt right

    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isnt
    usropenwin

    See Also
	Environment Variables especially XFILESEARCHPATH

 I get error messages on my screen about ldso libX11so4 not found
    set LDLIBRARYPATH to be usropenwin  If you also use X11 use
	     usrlibusr5libusropenwinlib
    If you put this in a shell script or your profile use
    OPENWINHOMEusropenwinlib instead of usropenwin this is for
    binsh for csh it is different

 I launch my filemgr and I get ldsomap heap error 9 at devzero
    Your system needs to be patched  Look in OPENWINHOMElibOSpatches
    and install the patch

 Why doesnt AnswerBook run for me
    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook	It wont run under
    X11 on an X terminal or on anything else because it uses NeWS to draw
    the PostScript text and pictures
    If you are using OpenWindows 30 you need to use the OpenWindows 30
    compatible navigator its called navigatorow3 on the AnswerBook CDROM
    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 30 you can replace
    navigator wih navigatorow3 altogether rename the old one first to
    satisfy your sense of paranoia
    The navigatorow3 binary is also on CDWare Vol 2
    Note that the data files are in PostScript so you can look at them with
    a PostSript viewer qv

 Why arent there any fish in realxfishdb
    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from
    ftpengauburnedu 1312041091 as pubrealxfishdbZ

 Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu
    It isnt implemented yet  Many programs do respond to the Properties
    Key L3 though or have a popup menu with Properties on it

 File completion in the Cshell is broken in cmdtool
    Sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and its fine  It also
    works if you run command tool on a remote machine
    Fixed in OpenWindows 301 shipped with Solaris 2

 When I run OLIT programs some of the widgets are red
    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation action widgets can be
    selected via the keyboard  The currently selected item is highlighted
    in red the Red Stain to show that it has the input focus
    To disable it in most places add this to your HOMEXdefaults file
	traversalOn off
	TextEdittraversalOn on
	TextFieldtraversalOn on
    You can change the color using for example
	InputFocusColor grey50
	inputFocusColor green
	ListinputFocusColor your background color
    See the man page resources3w at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set
    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation
    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 10045130 the
    OLIT30 CTE Jumbo Patch

 When I run several programs the colors on the screen all change when
  I move into a different window colormap flashing
    
    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time
    However you can minimise the effect with the following procedure
      Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve
      Run
	cmapcompact save
       to create the owcolors file
      Put the line
	cmapcompact init
       near the start of your startup file xinitrc
      Exit and then restart the window system
      cmapcompact init will push those colors owcolors to the end of
	the colormap and reserves them

    Also note that controlL2 locks the colors of the current window and
    ControlL4 unlocks them  this is described in the olwm manual page

 pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash see above
    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif
    window manager mwm with OpenWindows
    Try running pageview like this
	OPENWINHOMEbinreservecolors svmono
	OPENWINHOMEbinpageview
	OPENWINHOMEbinreservecolors discard

 XDM breaks things
    Command tool doesnt like being run without a Unix controlling terminal
    Use etcsetsid to start your command tools and all will be well
    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv as in
	svenv exec usrbintraffic
    because xdm wont set the necessary environment variables
    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root which is a security
    hole for OpenWindows use the OpenWindows 30 xdm or be aware that your
    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root

 Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working
    In OpenWindows 30 the X11 names keysyms for these keys was changed
    to SunXKF36 and SunXKF37	 Code which uses them should be recompiled
    or you might be able to get away with
	xmodmap e keysym SunXKF36  SunF36

Subject Trouble Shooting XView problems
    This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears which has been
    promised but hasnt reached here	Note that there is also a usenet
    newsgroup alttoolkitsxview although it doesnt sem to have very
    wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles
    per month	You should also look at the FAQ in compwindowsx

 how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items
    PANELLISTFONT takes an int rownumber and an Xvopaque fonthandle
    PANELLISTFONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xvopaque fonthandles
    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font
    You have to make sure that you always specify PANELLISTFONT when you
    insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function
    insertrowlist row string that hides the nasty bits

 how do I keep an XView popup window displayed after a button is pressed
    In the button callback do
        xvsetbutton PANELNOTIFYSTATUS XVERROR NULL
    This will keep the window visible
    You might also need to investigate the MENUNOTIFYSTATUS attribute

 how do I make an XView button look pressed
    call panelbeginpreview and panelcancelpreview these are
    documented in  er  the XView 3 source

 OpenWindows 3 imake doesnt work properly

Subject Environment Variables

    Environment variables and plausible values to use  this list doesnt
    take into account any local changes that you might have made of course
    This list is for OpenWindows 30  differences for OpenWindows 20 are
    marked and Ive added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5 too

    DISPLAY  The name of the X Windows Display to use
	00 on the local machine the one actually running X11 or xnews
	01 on some machines for a second monochrome screen
	machinerunningunix00 on other machines
	You may need to do xhost othermachine to let programs on other
	machines use your display see also under Trouble Shooting and see
	the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmers Guide
	pp 101ff
	See also console messages under Trouble Shooting
    FONTPATH  Where xnews searches for fonts
	usropenwinlibfonts
	you can also use xset fp dir to add a directory to the font path
	but you may have to do xset fp rehash afterwards  This is fine
	under OpenWindows but many X11 servers have font problems
    HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key or F1
	usropenwinliblocaleusropenwinlibhelp
	On SunOS 40 or with OpenWindows 20 omit the first entry which
	is for sites using a local other than C or USA
    LDLIBRARYPATH   Where to look to find shared C libraries
	usrlibusr5libusropenwinlibusrCCarch
	the usrCCarchlib entry is only needed if you use C programs
    OPENWINHOME	 Where OpenWindows lives
	usropenwin  
    KEYBOARD MOUSE  serial devices to use instead of the console
	dont set these for normal use devkbd and devmouse
    PATH  Where the Shell searches for programs to run
	OPENWINHOMEbinOPENWINHOMEbinxviewusrlocalbin
	HOMEbinarchusrucbusrbinusrbinX11usrhosts
	you will certainly want to change this example  There is no
	OPENWINHOMEbinxview in OpenWindows 30
    XFILESEARCHPATH  Where programs look for appdefaults files
	usropenwinlibTNS
        This is set automatically by openwin in OpenWindows 30
        You might want to use usrlibX11TNS or perhaps both
        separated with a  for example for sh users
            XFILESEARCHPATHOPENWINHOMElibTNSusrlibX11TNS
	    export XFILESEARCHPATH
	If you use X11R5 you might instead want
	    usrlibX11LTNCS
	    usrlibX11lTNCS
	    usrlibX11TNCS
	    usrlibX11LTNS
	    usrlibX11lTNS
	    usrlibX11TNS
	    OPENWINHOMElibTNS
	put all this on one line though with no spaces

	Together with the following in libXinitrc
	xrdb merge ENDXRDB
	   customization
	ENDXRDB

	xrdb merge ENDXRDB
	ifdef COLOR
	   customization  color
	endif
	ENDXRDB

	you automatically get a color oclock editres bitmap xcalc and
	xlogo since they use the customization resource appearing as C in
	the XFILESEARCHPATH see oclock n
	according to Rainer Sinkwitz sinkwitzifiunizhch


Subject Where Can I get It Ftp implementations etc

    XView 30 is available by anonymous ftp from exportlcsmitedu and
    elsewhere

    MoOLIT can be bought from ATT in source form

    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun or you can get the source from
    Interactive Systems Inc  It is also included in some vendors System V
    Release 4 implementations although thats not always the latest version
    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures
    is 30 for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 20
    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS and it is also included as
    the windowing system for Solaris

    There are said by Sun to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either
    available now or in progress  Unfortunately none of them seem to
    be available from anywhere  Contact anthonyovicom for more information

    Theres at least one book on using Solaris ie SunOS

    Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows
    although you may have to order it separately  Heres what I have they
    are each a little over 21 cm square wider than A4 paper and vary from
    about 1 cm to about 3cm thick  They say Users Guide or Programmers
    Guide on the front  The User manuals have a red stripe on the bottom
    and the Programmer ones have a green stripe
