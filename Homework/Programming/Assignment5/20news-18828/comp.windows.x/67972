 Does anyone know of any public domain toolkits for creating XWindows
 applications  I have used the Xt toolkit but I would like to
 create popup windowsdialog boxes etc using some sort of drawing editor
 instead of trying to specify what I want sizes positions etc
 within actual source code  Basically I am looking for something
 similar to Borlands WHITEWATER RESOURCE TOOLKIT for MSWINDOWS
 expect I need one for XWindows instead
 
 Any help would be much appreciated

   
     I recently found an excellent source for Xwindows programs Ive seen
quite a few xwindows toolkits up there The place is  

                     exportlcsmitedu

go to the contrib directory Its full of xwindows programs

                                           Hope this Helps
