 I wonder if anybody know of a Xwindowbased postscript file
 viewer that runs under SunOS prefered HPUX or IBM AIX

If you are running Sun OpenWindows you can use pageview  This is an
X Window PostScript previewer like ghostview but displays much nicer

Yes but its broken on OW 20  It does not handle multiple pages
well  If you dont have the proper PostScript commands it will
draw the entire document on the same page instead of pausing after
each page  I havent tried OW 30 yet though
