 I have compiled xfig 21 patchlevel 7 with HPs X11R5 from HPUX 901
 augmented by the Athena and Mu libraries from an X11R5 distribution
 from iworksecnuiowaedu  It compiles nicely although for one file
 the preprocessor macro definition table size needed to be increased
 But when executed nothing happens at all except for evergrowing
 memory requirements eventually climaxing in a core dump  The binary
 of the identical program compiled on 807 with X11R4 has no
 problems  Other programs like xtpanel compile link and run just
 fine with the same libraries
 
 Does this sound familiar or am I going to have to figure this one out
 on my own

Please see the post I made yesterday May 10 which fixes the problem
