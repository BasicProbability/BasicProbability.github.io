Subject X11R5 on aix 322 using cc

 I have gotten X11R5 pl 23 to compile on AIX 322 using cc
 but the server will not run it simplys starts and a couple seconds
 later exits no error are displayed 
 my defines for compile are
 DSYSV DAIXV3 DSYSVWAIT   DMALLOC0RETURNSNULL 

 
   could somewhere share some light or maybe the ibmcf file 

 thanks
