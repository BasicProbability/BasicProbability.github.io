X gurus
I am looking for a scientific graphing runtime X library  I want my code
to open a window and plot a graph in the window  The library should
manage plotting scaling of axes labeling etc

Can someone recommend a library to do this  Please respond via email

I would also be interested in this information

Check into the vopl and vogle libraries  I beleive that I still have
them available on ftpcmolssiuedu but Im not sure  I havent seen
any new announcements for the software but Im sure its still around

I have used it to do realtime data display and analysis as well as
just for producing graphs after the fact  It works well and supports
numerous graphics output formats including X  I tried it and liked
it  YOu may as well
