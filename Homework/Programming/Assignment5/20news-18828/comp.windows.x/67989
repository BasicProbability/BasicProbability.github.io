Subject X and Motif configfile for HPUX 80 


Hello everybody out there 

Im trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 121 on a HP running
HPUX 805 But it seems to be not very succesful because 
I have only hpcf configfiles for HPUX 70 

I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings
The motif applications are compiled quite well but they wont run
I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ but
I cannot fix it The XKeysymDBfile is at the right location and it
works fine under SunOS
Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong
configfile

Please help me 
  
Thanx in advance 
  Markus
