Markus Hello everybody out there 

Markus Im trying to compile X11R5pl23 and Motif 121 on a HP running
Markus HPUX 805 But it seems to be not very succesful because 
Markus I have only hpcf configfiles for HPUX 70 

Markus I tried standard cc and X was compiled with a lot of warnings
Markus The motif applications are compiled quite well but they wont run
Markus I receive the XKeysymDB error which is reported in FAQ but
Markus I cannot fix it The XKeysymDBfile is at the right location and it
Markus works fine under SunOS
Markus Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong
Markus configfile

Markus Please help me 
Markus   
Markus Thanx in advance 
Markus   Markus

If you installed X lib Xt by redefining ProjectRoot you will find that
 during the install it recompiles one of the files in X lib that does the
search for XKeysmDB and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
ProjectRoot was defined TO confirm this what happened because Im 
guessing go to mitlibX and do
strings XStrKeySymo  egrep XKeysymDB
