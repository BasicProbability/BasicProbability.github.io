Subject Re viewing postscript files under X windows

In article 1sk97rINNptbpolarisisicom kinisicom Kin Cho writes

I wonder if anybody know of a Xwindowbased postscript file
viewer that runs under SunOS prefered HPUX or IBM AIX
Reason Im looking for this utility is that Ive downloaded these
large postscript documents and Id like to know how useful and how
long they are before commiting them to the printer and potentially
wasting 200 pages of paper and hogging the printer for 12 hour


Get ghostscript and ghostview  Ghostview is a postscript previewer
