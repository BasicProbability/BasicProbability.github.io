Subject Re Looking for X windows on a PC

Hi All
       This is the first time Ive posted to the net so I hope this is
going to the right people
  Im looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that
allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC 
  The idea is to use the PC as a cheap X windows terminal for use by
process Engineers at work 

May I humbly suggest DESQviewX Of course Im biased

DESQviewX is a multitasker for DOS computers that uses a standard
X11R4 server as its display mechanism DOS applications and Microsoft
Windows standard mode are converted onthefly to Xprotocol allowing
you to display them or any R4 compatable Xprogram from any machine
on the net to display to the PCs local display or to any other display
on the net

Free tools are available for devloping Xapplications for the DVX platform
many Xprograms have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or
no modifications Often you only need to create a new makefile

If youre interested in more details you can check out the usenet group
composmsdosdesqview or just email me directly at supportqdeckcom
and Id be happy to fill you in
