Subject Piping tail f to a widget How oh Lord how

Ive spent the past week tearing my hair out trying to get the output of
a piped tail f to end up in a widget  Ive managed to make it work in
some ugly ways but either a X blocks on the tail and wont allow user
input b the tail f functions like just tail and doesnt follow the
expansion of the file c the tail f doesnt die after Ive closed
the pipe and destoryed the widget or d pclose blocks forever waiting
for tail to die
	I know this code has to exist  Anybody have it  A general
popen case would be perfered but at this point Ill take anything
Thanks
