  Hi people


  Im looking for X Servers for DOS or Windows

  Ive already seen DesqviewX and XVision but Id like to be
 aware of other choices

  Is there anything on the public domain or shareware 

  And in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive
 pricing 

  What about incompatibilities  Window managers 

  Any info is welcome



  Thanx in advance

  Bye
