Subject XView SUN XGL performance problem


Ive written an application for SparcStation 2 GX under OpenWindows 30

The application uses XView stuff to create my window and the SUN XGL
graphics library for rendering into the Canvas

The application does realtime 2D animation but it does not update the
the display fast enough
Im using notifysetitimer XView call to periodically kick off my
update routine and its not happening fast enough I want it to
update 25 times  second Its only doing about 11 Also it appears to
be compute bound because if I run anything else while my appplication is
up the update rate slows down even more

Any ideas 
Thanks
