Subject Dump of login screen


  Im running HPUX 807 with HP VUE 201 and I need a hardcopy of
  the login window the one asking  for login and password to 
  include in a manual 
  I have tried
   xwd display hostname0 root out loginxwd 

  from a login on a remote terminal but it doesnt work 
  Xwd seems to wait for the window server but the window
  server doesnt answer 

  Any suggestions I must use xwd because I dont have access to
  ftp and I cant obtain another program to grab the screen

  Thanks in advance
                                           Nadia Pitacco
