BUT  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone
From experience  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this
is a new install  The performance will be at least four times better
In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use  On top of that
they will cost about the same price a clone with 4MB RAM ethernet card
very high performance graphics card GOOD monitor server software TCPIP
for clone software mouse keyboard etc etc etc you spend a whole
lot of 

I can get 15 Tektronix XP11 terminals for under 900 and the performance
is over 80000 Xstones

I think your performance will depend upon the X server 

Im running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM 8MB swap and
it runs just fine  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway

You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal LinuxX setup for 900
and be better off than with an Xterminal IMHO
