 I have a problem which many of you might have run into  We use LOTS of
 ASCII terminals and use them to the max  Meaning lots of attributes line
 draw etc   Now what I need to do is come up with a working xterm which
 will emulate our advanced ASCII terminals as closely as possible
 
 This means needing all attributes to work including bold and line drawing
 The only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in
 which one is bold and the other normal while both have linedraw fixed
 spacing and several sizes
 
 The only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 9x15 and 9x15B under
 misc  They work great except I need a font one size larger 10x20  Now
 10x20 works well but there is no bold counterpart
 
 To make matters worse I need the fonts in some form I can use for Tektronix
 Xterminals  It seems they like pcf format although I should be able to
 convert a bdf format
 
 Anyone have any suggestions

This would be tedious but if you have the time you could get the bdf
file I can email it to you if you dont have it or dont have easy access 
to the X source and could make your own bold font from this  Since each
glyph is just a bitmap you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmapreadable file use bitmap to make each glyph bold and
convert the results back to bdf format  Then use bdftopcf to create
the pcf file  Then stick the pcf in usrlibX11fontsmisc or wherever
and include it in fontsdir and voila youll have what you need
