Subject How to draw in Invert mode with Color

  How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors
  and then erase it without having to redraw everything else

  Whats happening is this

      If I draw it using GXcopy it is drawn in the specified color  If I erase
      it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed it erases 
      whatever it overlayed  I then need to redraw
      all of the items it crossed  Yuch

      If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color  nothing 
      resembling what I requested  It properly restores the color of 
      underlying objects in erase mode

  Whats the solution
