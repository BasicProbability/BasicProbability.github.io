Subject Syncronous Modal Dialog

Hi
I have a lots of problems using XView libraries Release 32 in order to
do the following
 I want to create a MODAL Dialog which block the program flow
  a syncronous dialog ala Macintosh  as the Notice Panel
  does but with Text Item List Item and other XView objects
 The MODAL Dialog also must allows the Timer to be called why
  Notice doesnt do that
 
The problems are
 Using the xvwindowloop functions most XView objects dont work
  as the List Item and the timers arent called
 
 With the notifydispatch explicit I have problem because
  never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback
  routine as say the XView Programming Manual Third Edition
  on page 486 uhm I know this number 
  But I need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine
 
Help me please
 
Thanks in advance
 Giovanni
