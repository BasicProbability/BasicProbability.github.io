Subject Re Sun 4 as X terminal


 Xkernel is available for Sun 350s  Is there a similar package available
  
 
 Is this public domain If yes where can one obtain a copy from
	Yes it is  It is available at ftpctrcolumbiaedu probably
in pubxkernel  

	In response to the earlier gentlemans question you could
theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4  The binaries available are
for the sun350 but the author says it could be used on most
architectures and he does have a doityourself type distribution

	We use Xkernel for about 7 machines here  email me if you
have any questions I can help you with
