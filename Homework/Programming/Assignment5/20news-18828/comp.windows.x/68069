Subject Ignorant Imakexfig question

Hi folks

Im trying to compile xfig 217 on a SS1 running SunOS 411 and OW 20
and Im having a little trouble with makeimake  Specifically make bombs
when it needs to use any Xaw file  This isnt surprising since X11 files
on Suns with the standard OW 20 distribution are in various places under
usropenwin Xaw files are in usropenwinshareincludeX11Xaw 
Actually the real problem is that I know squat about imake and I dont
know how to tell imake where the X11 files are  I can see from the 
Makefile that its looking in the wrong places but the first line of the 
Makefile reads 

    Makefile generated by imake  do not edit

Help  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to
look  I have set DEFINES  DOPENWINBUG as it said to in the README
file

Email and post are both fine

Thanks in advance

Dave
