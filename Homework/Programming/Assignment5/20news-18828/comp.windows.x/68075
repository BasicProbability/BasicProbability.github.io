 Hi All
        This is the first time Ive posted to the net so I hope this is
 going to the right people
   Im looking for software packages that run on an IBM PC clone that
 allows me to display Openlook and motif windows on the PC 


I highly recommend Starnets MicroX  They have versions for DOS and Windows
with support for PCTCP or the Clarkson packet drivers  I have used it
successfully with twm mwm and olwm over both ethernet and SLIP
And their tech support is top notch  They really impressed me  

Kevin
