Subject How to make a windows input be ALL CAPS without Caps Lock

An application we must use requires uppercase input  Id like to be
able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running
just a text window xterm or some such and have everything I type be entered
as ALL CAPS  When the cursor is in any of my many other windows I want to
automatically return to normal functionality  I have pointtotype set

Is there a way to do this in X specifically OW 30 on SPARCs  Is there a
way to mess with Xdefaults to make a category of window do this  Any
hints would be most appreciated  I program in C but not X although I can
pick up somthing thats not too involved

Thanks kindly
