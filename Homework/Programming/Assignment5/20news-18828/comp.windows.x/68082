Xm is a user interface framework for the C language built upon X11
and the XToolkit It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming
interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets
Xm was initially created for the Motif widget set now support for the
Athena widgets was added Applications created with Xm run in both
environments without changes although many nice features are only
available when using Motif
In some situations Xm extends the underlying toolkit ie providing
a ComboBox borrowed from MSWindows but never tries to replace it 
data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated
in rare cases

Xm has nothing common with Motif besides the general idea to
encapsulate Motif widgets in C objects and the  in its name Many
ideas for the Xm architecture came from Digitalks Smalltalk version
which provides an easy to use framework for WindowsPMMac applications
in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and
a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm dialogs 

Top level objects in Xm
 Windows SystemDialogs and ToolBoxes which use the automatic layout
  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw
 UserDialogs which can be individually laid out with a user interface
  builder a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this
  distribution

Controls children of top level objects
staticText staticImage pushButton checkBox radioButton
edit listBox comboBox groupBox paneArea drawing toolBar

The staticImage and all the button classes can display bw Xbitmap
format or color GIF format pictures as an alternative to a label text

Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects
Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm objects


CommonInteractII is built upon the Xm drawing class and provides
components for building direct manipulative applications Is is a very
simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system
research project of our institute in 1991 an approach to define a
software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications
with multiple interaction media ie sound alternative input devices
If you are interrested look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP SIGS
Publications  Journal of Object Oriented Programming  there should be
our paper about CommonInteract but be aware that it is our state of
the art from 1991
CommonInteractII is still undocumented and is included because it was
used to implement the dialog editor It currently supports only drawing
primitives lines rectangles circles but we plan to extend it to
support bitmaps and some controls also
Known problem the Xm drawing class has no redrawing strategy always
redraws the whole window even after minimal changes like selecting an
object this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed


About this first release

Xm is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here
for smaller applications which are running without problems So I think
I can call it a beta release which can be used to develop applications
for any noncritical purposes
CommonInteract may be called a pre alpha release Its development will
be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research
project here Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems
to be stable and can be used for experimental applications

Platforms this release was compiled and tested on
  HP9000720 running HPUX 807
  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 411
  PCAT386 running Linux v099pl6

Caution although the whole stuff was initially developed using an ATT
standard C compiler  this release is tested only with GNU g 233 or
above the next release will be tested with both compilers
