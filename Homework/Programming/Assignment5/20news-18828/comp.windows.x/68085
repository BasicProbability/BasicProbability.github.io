 Keywords tvtwm icon manager
 
 Need help on resource bindings for tvtwm  Heres what Id like to
 see the icon manager do
 
 Say I iconify a window and this shows up on the icon list  Now when I 
 pan into another section of the virtual desktop and try to deiconify
 the window that I iconed sp   earlier Id like this window to
 deiconify in the current region
 
 Any resources that I can use to do this   Or more important can I 
 do this   Rather find it painful to remember where I iconified a 
 window go back there and deiconify  Or simply it is a pain to 
 pan around to get to a deiconified window
 
 Thanks
