Subject Xdec X11R5 server and DECstation 5000205 sans DECnet

Has anybody built an X11R5 server that can run on a Personal Decstation
5000 line with ultrix 43  The only catch is that being personal machines
we did not install DECnet onto them which the Xdec server on gatekeeper
requires

any replies welcome
