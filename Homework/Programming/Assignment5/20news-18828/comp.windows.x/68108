Does anyone have any ideas that may be implemented to help prevent users from
losing sight of the cursor in an XTerm window under certain circumstances where
there are many screenbased fields

What I would like to do is make the cursor flash on or off but so far havent
found a way of doing so  Has anybody else had similar problems or fixes to
make a cursor stand out more than the standard type

Users cant find the cursor  Run xneko  itll turn the cursor into a
mouse rodent variety    If your users still cant find it the cat will
