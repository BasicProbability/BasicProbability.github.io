 OK I am looking for a decent X based text editor for the  the following
 reasons
 	o I hate emacs
 	o I hate vi
 	o I hate Xedit
 
 Coming from a PC based environment having been brought up on
 Borlands excellent Turbo CPascal environments something with the
 following properties would fit the bill
 
 	o Pull down menus
 	o Accelerator Keys
 	o Multiple windows
 	o Mouse Aware
 	o Regular Exp support
 	o Mappable Key Bindings
 	o Easy to use
 	o and most important of allFREE
 
 Does such a beast exist

Sure sounds like aXe to me
