 OH BOY have I wanted this too  However I believe that the cursor will
 be under the servers control could be wrong  On an Xterminal for
 example if the server was NOT the one controlling the cursor then trying
 to get the xterm application to do the blinking would cause needless and
 yucky network overhead consistantly
 


Most people who write cursor blinking code just implement the simple case a
straight 500msec or so onoff cycle  However the cursor will work much
better if cursor blinking is suppressed ie the cursor is made visible any
time the cursor moves and for 5 to 1 sec thereafter  If you dont do this the
cursor will be hard to track when in motion

You allways could port and use emu from exportlcsmiteducontribemutarZ
Weve implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor horizontal  ver
tical line cursors smaller block cursors turn on and off blinking
set the blink rate and so on You even get blinking text  ok enough
advertising

I havent looked at the xterm code in this respect but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted mostly the blinking text Id say it wont be easy since
xterm is a hairy mess understandable if you follow its roots back to
X10

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isnt that difficult if you
provide the right hooks As Antonio mentioned youll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved or people will become confused
Since its a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways this isnt very complicated Youll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
its mapped

As for the portability of emu and its newest version The one on export
is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now but unfortunately were drowning in work
But since the changes arent affectiong emus behavior much Id say
whoever wants to try emu shouldnt wait for a new version

As is emu wont work on BSD derived systems eg SUNs with anything else 
than a csh There is a fix to this which is very short remove one line
of code Ill put this on export today
