Yes that is a bug in the X11r5 port of xterm You sometimes get this when
you start from XDM I have reported this to Casper but dont know whether
it made it into his set of patches yet

Basically in mitclientsxtermmainc there is a test at line 1598 which
checks errno after attempting to open devtty Add the errno  EINVAL
case to it and you should be fine

Its actually a bug in the Solaris 21 kernel We could add a workaround to
xterm open should never return EINVAL but it does 

I didnt have time to update the R5SunOS5 patch lately but non
of the existing problems seem to warrant a new set of patches

Since xsession is a Bourne shell script anyway you might as well add a line
	 etcTIMEZONE
as it is done in etcprofile

XDM coulda also keep the XDM environment variable It should have inherited
it from the environment
