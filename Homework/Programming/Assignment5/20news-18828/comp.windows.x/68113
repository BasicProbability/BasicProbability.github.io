  Price
  		PCXview for DOS      44500 for 1  178000 for 5
 
 
 NCD just announced a new generation of PCXview They
 changed the name a little though and I cant remember
 exactly PCXsomething
 
 It now supports Windows and their press release
 implies that since its still priced in the 500 range
 and its so featurefull why buy anything else
 Disclaimer This is not a direct quote from the 
 literature but I think it sums it up Also I have
 never used the product


Its called PCXWare  It is based on NCDWare their Xterminal
software which  IMHO is excellent  PCXWare will include
XRemote and be optimized for 32 bit machines Its X11R5 based
It will support remote management etc


Not an NCD employee just a fan
