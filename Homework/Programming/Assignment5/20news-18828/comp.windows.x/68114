Subject X11R5Pl23 and Sun386i works but not on the screen


Hello

I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help
me with it
Ive built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got I
think 23 Building was easy After installing everything I started X but
nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed the machine seemed
to hang I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well
ps told me that theres a Xserver and a xterm running And with some 
experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing D I blindly hit the
xterm endet the session and got my prompt back
I guess its a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet
Ive got a Sun386i with a bw framebuffer ACE6 0688 94V0 Rev 53
SunOS 402 and ROM 44
Please help me Im able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to
other machines but thats not what I did it for

Thanks in advance
Stefan
