Subject Re Button 3 popup menus with Athena widgets

Ok Im being driven batty

Trying to create popupmenus ie button3 press and a menu
appears  I would really like to use the standard Athena
classes to achieve this goal but for my best attempts
I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton
as the parent of the widget tree  I know this should be
possible to to with an XtPopupSpringLoaded and a
little twiddling but something is escaping me

Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu 423 Positioning the SimpleMenu
The reference is to the R5 documentation

I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and
MenuPopup actions
