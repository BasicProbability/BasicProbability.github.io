BUT  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone

I have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 48633Mhz
system

Show me the realistic price tag

I can get 15 Tektronix XP11 terminals for under 900 and the performance
is over 80000 Xstones

Excuse me but with a 48650 256k cache S3 928 ISA card 8Mb XS3 X11R5 running 386bsd  you can get 100k xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt 

Nice but way over 900
My point is priceperformance  not just performance
