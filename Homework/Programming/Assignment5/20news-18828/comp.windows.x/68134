  BUT  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone
  
  I have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 48633Mhz
  system
  
  
  I can get 15 Tektronix XP11 terminals for under 900 and the performance
  is over 80000 Xstones
  
  You will not come even CLOSE to the performance of an XP10 series plus you 
  
  Excuse me but with a 48650 256k cache S3 928 ISA card 8Mb XS3 X11R5 running 386bsd  you can get 100k xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt 
 
 This is hardly apples to apples Try running the benchmark over a
 network to the clone and and if youre still getting 100K Xstones
 then youve got a good machine X terminals arent just a server you know

I would further add that a 48650S39288mb15200mbDISK is going to cost
WAY more than 900 probably 3000  Color makes it not applesapples too
Xterminals provide better priceperformance than PCs  You can make a PC
much cheaper and perform much worse and you can make PCs perform great and
cost more  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC  For home user that extra functionality is worth the added cost
