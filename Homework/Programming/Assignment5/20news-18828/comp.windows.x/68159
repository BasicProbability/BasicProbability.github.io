Subject VXT2000 Windowing Terminal Help

Greetings


We have several VXT 2000 Windowing terminals and associated software on our
network  We are able to open a LAT terminal window to any of our workstation
nodes but we are unable to get a LAT X session to work

We have customized the terminal security to allow all LAT connections

Trying to invoke a LAT X session from the VXT 2000 results in the following
message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area

Host Does Not Support X Sessions

The host is a VAX4000 Model 60 and does support X sessions


Opening a LAT terminal window and logging into the server node setting the
display variable as follows

 set displaycreatenodeLATtransportlat

and then trying to create a decterm on the VXT as follows

 createtermdectermdetach

Fails and gives the following error message

dectermport failed to find language XOpenDisplay  returned NULL
DECWFCANTOPENDISPL Cant open display

The VXT 2000 is using its system defaults ie default fonts language 
except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling 
LAT protocol

we have VT1200 windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
LAT X sessions

VMS Version is 551
Running DECwindowsMotif of VAX4000 Model 60s


Please help
