Subject Re Blinking Cursor in Xterm

Yes Dont confuse the mouse cursor with the text cursor in the xterms
The latter is only controlled by the application
Back in the days of X111 I did analyse the xterm code The cursor 
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character I doesnt
seem to be changed til now
But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
XtAppAddTimeOut or similar 

XtAppAddTimeout doesnt work in xterm because despite appearances 
to the contrary xterm is not really an Xt based application  Other
sources like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterms main
loop So dont be surprised when you try this and it doesnt work
