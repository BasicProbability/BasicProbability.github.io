 Im quite familiar with a variety of window title setting methods
 
 My question is  Is there any way via Resources etc to stop an
 applications ability to rename its own Name  IconName properties
 

Sorry thats a feature  The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title so the wm is obliged to do it  If this bothers you complain to the app writer

 who cares if its not nice to the application

Write your own wm that doesnt support the ICCCM  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it your program switches it back again
