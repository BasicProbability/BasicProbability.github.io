Subject DetectingSaving Geometry Changes

Hi

Im trying to get my program to monitor resizeposition events
so that when the program exits I can save the last known geometry in 
some sort of preferences file

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell

 XtAddEventHandlertopLevelStructureNotifyMaskFalseconfigureCBmyData

This works fine and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager mwm

However when Im just resizing the window using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration the x and y are set to zero in the
XEvent passed to the event handler callback  Im accessing the xconfigure
structure like the X11 manual says  xevxconfigurex xevxconfigurey
The width and height memebers are correct

When I reposition the window using the window manager the xevents xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x y width height member settings

Q1 Anybody know why when just resizing the x and y are being set to zero

Q2 Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes

Ive tried using XtGetValues on the topLevel widget when exiting my
application before destroying any widgets and all I get is garbage values
for the x y width height resources

Thanks
