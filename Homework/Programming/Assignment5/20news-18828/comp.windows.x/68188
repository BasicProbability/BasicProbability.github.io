Subject keycode wrong for XKeyReleasedEvent 

I am writing a Xbased dosemu which requires XKeyReleasedEvent 
I found the keycode of XKeyReleasedEvent is wrong   If I run the program on
a Linux hostXFree12 with  DISPLAY set to the local Linux and to
the Sun host X11R5 the two keycodes from the two Xservers are different 
Of course the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is OK

Can anybody verify this      Did I do anything wrong  
	
Thanks
