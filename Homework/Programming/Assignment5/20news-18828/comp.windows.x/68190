Subject Re imakerules problem under Solaris 2

Hey folks
Im attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious
to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that
has subdirs generated by imake on Solaris 2 platforms 

For example make makefiles chokes in the very first subdirectory 

	ie target subdirMakefiles not found 

You dont give the precise error message but I assume that
the making of the target fails because make cant find the rules

Weve seen this happen with SunOS 5x make as well and aat this
point Im not sure why it happens It seems to happen
with large Makefiles The entries near the end get lost
Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem
as it does in your example

In the MIT R5 distribution  R5SunOS5patch this can happen with
the target Makefiles in one of the doc directories

At first I thought this was a bug with make on my Sun but I built and used gnumake with the
same results Attached youll find the first Makefiles target rule from the generated makefile

This is really weird Are your really sure that you were using GNU make
