system Linux as opposed to MSDos and I like it alot  But when I
try to run startx I get a strange response My monitor goes into
graphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen  thats
all Nothing else  Now Ive collected almost every FAQ in the world to
help me but either its too confusing or I must be missing something
  My setup
	386DX about 20Mhz
	Trident 8900C SVGA w1 Meg
	4 MB RAM
	Plenty of HD space
Any help is appreciated
