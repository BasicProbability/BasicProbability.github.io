Subject X shared libraries and replacing modules in them


Hi

Im wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module as XKeybindo
in a shared library as libX11so in Suns OpenWindows I tried to RTFM but
I didnt get any wiser that way Also can I do the same on an RS6000 machine
running 322 if it is possible at all I know how to do it with real 
libraries ar I am trying to replace XLookupString in the delivered
libraries with another that does a few special things
