Subject Re Blinking Cursor in Xterm

As quoted from 1993May132123212563moepidoopende by bernwardmoepidoopende Bernward Averwald

 Back in the days of X111 I did analyse the xterm code The cursor 
 was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character I doesnt
 seem to be changed til now
 But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
 XtAppAddTimeOut or similar 

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also DESQviewX
which does this in its DOS windows  Do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt
