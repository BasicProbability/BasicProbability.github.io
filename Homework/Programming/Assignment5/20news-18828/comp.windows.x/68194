Subject Re Outline scalable fonts versus bitmap replicated scalable fonts


After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing

  1 My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation 
     problem

  2 That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
     to meet your requirements  

     This means that if you server return a response like the following

     adobehelveticamediumonormal007575p0iso88591

     You can ask for the follwogin

        adobehelveticamediumonormal141009090p0iso88591
 
     and it will generate it for you  You should try to always use 
     known pixel sizes
