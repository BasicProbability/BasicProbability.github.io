Subject Re CMotif gcc silly messages

Thanks to everyone who mailed help unfortunately the end problem was a REALLY
stupid oversight on my behalf The code was 100 perfect but it might
help to add ControlC to my makefile

	Anyway the mangled name was telling me it couldnt locate the Control
constructor

	I just want to reaffirm what a valuable book this one is Im enjoying
evry page
