  Im posting this request again since the last one had no title
 
  Im looking for X server software on DOS or Windows
 
  Ive already seen DesqviewX and XVision but would like to be aware
 of other solutions namely public domain or shareware implementations
 
  Id also like to know in the commercial case about possible problems
 incompatibilities available window managers and libraries etc
 
  If you have any experiences in this area please let me know
