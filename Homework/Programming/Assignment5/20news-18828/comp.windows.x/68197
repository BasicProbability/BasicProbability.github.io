Subject Re viewing postscript files under X windows

OW 30 is the same  But the definition of broken is relative  Pageview
requires DSC compliant PostScript files in order to stop at page breaks
I dont consider that broken  I say that any program that puts out a
PostScript file that isnt DSC compliant is broken

Well that may be true  However the man page for pageview for OW 20
does not mention about DSC compliance  In any event the point here
is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will
find out that its not a practical tool
