Subject MSWindows  XWindows conversion


Hi All

Ive heard of a commercial package named ZINK that could convert MSWindows
sourcecode to XWindows sourcecode C The only problem is the package
isnt available in Holland at least I cant find it anywhere  

Is there another package preferrably free or shareware that can do the 
same thing And if so where can I find or buy it

Thanks in advance

Arjen
