ME As is emu wont work on BSD derived systems eg SUNs with
ME anything else than a csh There is a fix to this which is very
ME short remove one line of code Ill put this on export today

Its more than that actually In the version on export one cannot just
specify a POSIX tty behaviour the POSIX config files are incomplete
without those of some specific platforms like Suns and DECs I looked
twice at porting emu to linux but stopped short becuse of the tty
part Is there a cleaner version of emu that supports POSIX tty
explicitly

Hmm depends on how you define clean Jordan implemented the system
dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for
call it operating system types then you go ahead and write a include
file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
implementations Since both Jordan and I havent encountered a 
OS flavor yet that is fully POSIX we havent gotten around to
really implement and test a toplevel include file specifically
for just posix The posix routines are used in the sun specific file
ttysuni for example but here we also use some bsd stuff All in all
it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
every operating system than ifdefing in existing ones The type
of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
sources Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 
couple of times this only uses up some disk space since only the 
drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be 
compiled into emu

It shouldnt be hard to come up with a ttylinuxi file that fully
relies on the posix stuff but unfortunately I dont have a linux
system available to me so I cant do the port myself I would suggest
you read the README in termsysdep and if you have any problems or
questions contact me and we could try to sort this out Unfortunately
we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu since we 
just dont have access to that many different systems
