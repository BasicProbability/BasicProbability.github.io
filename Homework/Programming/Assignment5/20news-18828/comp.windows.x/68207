Subject SVR4 xclients wont work under SVR42 repost

When I changed from SVR4 to SVR42 on my Intel box I discovered that
some of my SVR4 xclients such as xload etc would no longer work


They bomb out with the message

error cant open display unix00

Is this because they cant find the correct shared libraries they need
to be recompiled or have I not used the correct options

Both systems use X11R5

Thanks

Jack
