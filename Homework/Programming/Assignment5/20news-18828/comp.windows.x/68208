Ive run into a bit of a snag while trying to get Mac X up and running and would appreciate
any responses from anyone who may have seen this problem

On my local network I have a number of Macs Suns and SGI machines

I have installed MacXMacTCP on all of the Macintoshes and can run Xclients on the SGI machines
all the livelong day  The problem is when I try to run an Xclient on any Sun I setup
the command in MacX then execute it  Nothing happens I dont even get any command output

Now I thought it might be a routing issue but I can run remote Xclients on the suns from my SGI
machines as well as viceversa  I can also run remote Xclients on SGI machines that
are NOT on my local net here but the above problem holds true for nonlocal Suns as well

I tried to send this as private mail but mail to benjossahqnasagov was
rejected so here it is

Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Suns network address etchosts
or NIS hosts database  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOSbased
machine there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX
