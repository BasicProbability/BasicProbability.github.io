Subject SUMMARY How to make a windows input be ALL CAPS

Thanks to Bruce Barnett who recommended xvttool and Bernward Averwald and
Liam Quin who recommended modifying Xdefaults to get the desired behavior
for a class of xterms

In xvttool simply create a key file that looks like
a	A
b	B
c	C

and specify said key file on the command line  This will translate
any input into any other in my case locase to upcase  Works great and
you get a customizable buttonpad on the right or left side

To use an xterm solution add to your Xdefaults
capxtermVT100Translations override 
   Keya stringAn
   

or
capxtermvt100translations override n
        Keya insertstringA n
        Keyb insertstringB n
        

and invoke as xterm name capxterm

Thanks loads
