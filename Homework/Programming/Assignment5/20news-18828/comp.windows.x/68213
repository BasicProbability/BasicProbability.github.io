 It seems silly but while Ive located things like tgif that can  edit
 gif  files and various tools to convert tofrom gif format I havent
 been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a
 gif file in it  Ive looked thru various faq files also to no avail
 Is there one lurking about in some  archive   Nothing  sophisticated
 just show the pretty picture
