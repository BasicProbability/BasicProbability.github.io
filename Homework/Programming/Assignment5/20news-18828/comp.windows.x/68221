Subject Motif 12 and OW 30  compiling xcoral

Ive built xcoral on my system SunOS 413 X11R5 Motif 12 OW 30
and it builds fine but when I run it any child windows that xcoral
opens
1 locks the mouse into the window area
2 doesnt accept any input from the mouse

Needless to say this is a pain in the ass as I have to go find an
empty terminal to login and kill xcoral

Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif  Is there a patch
