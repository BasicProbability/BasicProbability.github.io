Subject makedepend problem

Hi netters

We have a problem with makedepend it doesnt know how to correctly process
if clause in C preprocessor statements It evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are
For example makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files as distributed
by Sun  namely Xosh

if     definedSUNOS41  definedSTDC
       include stringh
       define  index   strchr
       define  rindex  strrchr
else    BSD  STDC 
       include stringsh
endif   SUNOS41  STDC 

Here makedepend evaluates both if and corresponding else statements
to true and tries to open the file stringsh which doesnt exist
under Solaris2
We also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy code
We got and built makedepend off the net  it didnt fix the problem

In all fairness it should be noted that makdepend manpage Suns
distribution mentions this problem

BUGS
     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp  the  Berkeley  C
     preprocessor then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
     that all if directives will evaluate to  true  regardless
     of  their  actual  value  This may cause the wrong include
     directives to be evaluated  Makedepend should  simply  have
     its own parser written for if expressions

Has anybody come up with some solutionfix to makdepend other than
WriteYourOwnParser and willing to share it with us

Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed  please reply 
directly to my email address  Ill post a summary

Thanks in advance
