When attempting to connect to an SGI Indigo from a PC clone using
a commercial X windows emulation package the X package hangs in
a prelogin X screen mode  The login box wont display  Using
the package in telnet mode I can logon to the SGI and run any
none graphic type things  On the PC I get an error
Read error 0 on socket 1  raw socket error

On the SGI in xdmerrors
I get a termination error when I kill the stalled screen on the PC

On the SGI in SYSLOG
datetimeSGI xdmHung in XOpenDisplayremote0 aborting
                      server open failed for remote0 giving up

I have all access control disabled I believe SYSLOG message confirms
this when I login on the SGI  I believe I have the SGI set up properly
as described in the X ADm book by ORielly

The X emul package tech support hasnt been able to solve the problem

So what Im looking for is some suggestions on where to look for problems
and possible tests to run to narrow down the questions
Thanks
