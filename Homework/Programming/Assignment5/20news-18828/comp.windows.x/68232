 Ive been getting mail from Xhibition about the June conference and I was
 wondering if Microsoft had bought Xhibition  The front says Conference
 from Microsoft Windows NT Developers  Whats the deal  I thought
 Xhibition was for Xwindows

I was wondering this myself

and not surprisingly when you look at the audience Windows NT

With the bulk of the Xhibition audience and the UNIX community developing
applications for inhouse or custom use a new 32bit operating system from a
player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated With MS Windows on so many
desktops and the price of computing power dropping its successor needs to be
evaluated  As corporations begin to look at NT so must their developers and
suppliers

what you need  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development
Kits to bang on evaluate and generally to see for yourself

I hope this doesnt sound like an NT commercial it should sound like an
Xhibition commercial

Unfortunately it does  I dont agree with the logic of NT at an X windows
conference  Perhaps some good will come of it but the two are so dissimilar
and the NT marketing stuff is so large in the Xhibition adds that I was 
coming to a similar conclusion as Jesse
