Subject what is a clients DISPLAY variable set to


Is there an easy ie via shell commands way to tell what the DISPLAY 
environment variable is for any given client process  Sometimes I can 
get what I want by typing ps axe if
   a the client was invoked with a display argument
      or
   b DISPLAY is one of the first few variables defined in the environment
      actually Ive never seen b but its there to illustrate the type 
      of thing Im looking for

Ultimately I wish to determine the number of displays that are simultaneously 
running a given X application

my system SunOS 412 sun4c

thanks for any help
