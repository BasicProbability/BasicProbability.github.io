Subject Help w X11R5p22 w Sun 4110 cg2 framebuffer


Xsun wont come up in color w this framebuffer I am trying to use xkernel on
some of these 4110s I have a freshly built Statically linkes copy of Xsun
that works just fine on cg6 cg4 bw2 type of framebuffers but on the 4110
that have this type of frame buffer all I get is Mono

cgtwo0 at vme24d16 0x400000 vec 0xa8 
cgtwo0 Sun3 color board fast read

Here is what Ive tried

removing all the other devcg  devbw  and devfb and then selectivly
recreating devcgtwo0 Xsun comes up mono recreating devfb comes up mono

Ive tried Xsun  Xsun dev devcgtwo0

PS Xnews will come up in color but its not statically linked and the
dynamically linked Xsun comes up in mono also

PPS Xsun was compiled on w gcc 233 on a system running 413 and the 4110
is also running 413

Thanks n advance
