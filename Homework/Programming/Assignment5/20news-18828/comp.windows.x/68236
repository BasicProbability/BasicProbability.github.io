Subject Querying XDM to manage a remote display  How under Linuxxfree86

We have Suns running SunOS 413 and Openwindows 30 X11R4 We have
used Xvision on a PC setup to broadcast query to the UNIX xdm servers and
allow a user to choose a UNIX client in which to login xdm will then
manage that display I would like to do the same thing with xfree86
running under Linux but I dont know how I dont want to hardwire the UNIX
xdm to manage the PC displays as the PCs are not always running Linux 
let alone xfree86 I would like the same setup as provided by Xvision

Can anybody help
Thanks
