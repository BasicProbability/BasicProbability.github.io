I can also live with a utility that converts postscript to plain
text perferably retaining page counts so that I know how many pages
the original document contains


	Well I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion  First
get ghostscript and check out the gs2ascps file that comes with it
It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the
page and maintains page counts  Ive written a little C program to
massage the output of gs dNODISPLAY gs2ascps somewhat so that you
can get all the ascii strings in the document  No guarantees that it
wont break up wordssentences though  Ive used it with varying
degrees of success  Anyways try this out it may do what you want


  massager a filter for use with gs does crude PostscriptASCII conversion
 
  Usage
 	cat fileps  gs dNODISPLAY gs2ascps   massager
 
  I print a CtrlL after each new page
 
  Put the following source into massagerc and compile it
 

include stdioh
include stringh

main

	char	line1000 p

	while fgetsline sizeofline stdin  NULL
		if line0  P
			printffn
		else if line0  S  line1    
			if p  strrchrline   NULL
				continue
			p  0
			if p  strchrline   NULL
				continue
			for p p p
				if p    p1    p1  
					putcharp
			putcharn
		

	return0
