Subject X11R5 on IBM RS6000

Yes we have the same problem with xinit  The problems seems to come from the
fact that the XOpenDisplay0 fails   If we try on our machine
named godzilla

setenv DISPLAY godzilla00
Xibm
xterm 


It works fine but the following will not work

setenv DISPLAY unix00
Xibm
xterm 

Did we set a configuration option incorrectly  Thank you for any assistance
you can offer
