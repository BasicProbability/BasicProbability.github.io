 Back in the days of X111 I did analyse the xterm code The cursor 
 was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character I doesnt
 seem to be changed til now
 But if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
 XtAppAddTimeOut or similar 

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous though see also DESQviewX
which does this in its DOS windows  Do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt

So what Im running emu on a 25 MHz 68020 box I cannot make out ANY
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not If you think about it a bit a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest PC Since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus this 
application is active anyway To repeat it a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software
