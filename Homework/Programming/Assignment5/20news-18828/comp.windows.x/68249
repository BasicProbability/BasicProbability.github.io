Ive run into a bit of a snag while trying to get Mac X up and running and would appreciate
 
 stuff deleted

are NOT on my local net here but the above problem holds true for nonlocal Suns as well

I tried to send this as private mail but mail to benjossahqnasagov was
rejected so here it is

same here


Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Suns network address etchosts
or NIS hosts database  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOSbased
machine there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX


I received similar informationadvice about what appears to be the same problem 
Benjamin has and I still have
NIS has all the information about the Macs
I even put explicit entries in etchosts to no avail
Monitoring with snoop on my Classic the initial REXEC packet is sent to
the the SUN which sends something to the correct Mac but nothing appears
at the Mac
rexecd is number one suspect but its more suble than the README suggests and
I havent yet looked into it further
