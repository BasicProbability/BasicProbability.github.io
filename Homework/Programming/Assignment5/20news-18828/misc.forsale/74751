 I heard on one of these newsgroups a week or two ago that the Kathy Ireland
 Budweiser posters were popular  There are supposedly halfsize and lifesize
 posters  Well someone I know got a lifesize standup cardboard thick damn
 good quality one and was wondering what it was worth  Anybody

  What about the St Pat posters from last year  I have a stack of about 
twenty and two of the cardboard cutouts  No they are NOT for sale I 
collect them
