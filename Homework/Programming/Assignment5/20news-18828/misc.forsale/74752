Subject HELP How to get a SCUMSTER


Hi everyone


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac The scumster  REP  called my friend and
they agreed on a price My friend unexperienced and not too fluent in
English paid by check requesting REP to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send Well the check was cashed 324 and that is
that Phone  that REP gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left email address does not
bounce but again there is no answer I know that REP is a student at
University of Delaware I have his email address his US postal address
and his  phone The question is WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED

Thanks in advance for any advice

Sincerely
Victor Levenson VVL2Hvirginiaedu

PS The reason I did not put REPs full name is that I still hope


PPS If I get enough responses I will post a summary maybe even on a
regular basis
