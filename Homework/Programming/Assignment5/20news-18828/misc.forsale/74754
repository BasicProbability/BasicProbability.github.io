		   ASKING PRICE   1700 OBO

Mind my asking why youre selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new A4000030
A4000EC0304 megs120meg IDE HDHD Floppyv30 OS  1899

Id like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1K without monitor  Brand new the A300025mhz50 meg HDHD
floppy21 ROM isnt running for more than 1400 or so

Considering its damaged probabably has a real old version of the OS
Ill offer 700  Dont laughmy A2000 isnt worth more than
250300 these days
