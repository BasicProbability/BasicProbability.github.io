So does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS60 is worth upgrading to
How good is its compression and can it be turned onoff at will
Any other nicenasty features

According to reports if you dont have DOS yet and dont have any
utilities QEMM Stacker PCTools Norton  then DOS6 may be worth it 

For people who have DOS5 and some sort of utility DOS6 doesnt offer
much Youd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create however
