Subject delaysampler

Hey  I am interested in buying a digital delay pedal preferably
capable of sampling and infinite repeat  If youre familiar
with Phil Keaggy I want to mimic or at least as close as possible
what he does in concert ie click the pedal play something click
it again and what he played between clicks repeats infinitely while
he playes leads over it  Anyway let me know
