Sony TCDD3 DAT walkman for sale  Hardly used still under
warrantee  Comes with optical digital inputoutput as well as standard
RCA analog cables Includes recharable battery charger and AC adaptor 
65000 or best offer 

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman
the TCDD7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3  Also the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks  Oh the D3 has always been
available through mailorder houses for less than 700 dollars new with
the new model coming out I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less
