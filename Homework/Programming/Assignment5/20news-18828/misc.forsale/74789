 Recently I bought a musical instrument through the internet and had
 it shipped to me via UPS ground The shipping was done through a
 mail box service Mailboxes Etc  Being somewhat surprised at the
 price I compared prices of shipping this way to shipping directly
 through UPS and this is a summary  I am not making any endorsements
 or condemnations but merely presenting the facts from which you may
 draw your own conclusions
 
 
 Ive encountered the same thing with Mailboxes Etc and I suggest
 anyone to use the original UPS service if at all possible Shipping
 to Virginia from Cleveland was around 20 for 12 pounds and COD
 was 800 as opposed to 450 for UPS

Ill third the opinion about this outfitfranchise Now when I
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs Ill specify that I
only pick up the normal UPS charges as if delivered directly to
UPS as Ive been burned by 10 shipping charges for a 249 pkg
I will never use a mailing service unless I dont have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY Ill also
tell the person if they agreed to pick up shipping what is going on

Other things to watch out forconsider

	The rates are 5 to 30 higher than UPS direct

	For a nonUPS truck package they quoted a rate
	of 85 Fed Ex economy air was only 85 for the
	same weight RPS a trucking package company in many
	cities only wanted 18 Guess who got it The Mailbox
	operator told me I was not telling the truth about
	competitors rates said RPS was unreliable Ive used them
	before with NO problems etc Right

	A COD check goes to the mailing service Our local
	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check All this for an additional 300 over the
	UPS COD charge What a deal 

	For packages over 100 they charge you about double over
	what UPS charges them for insurance Ive never had
	a claim but other netters is Ralph Seguin out there
	have told horror stories about them

	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by
	Mailbox

	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct UPS Does he ever check Probably not

	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Exs economy
	air rate and Fed Ex will pick up

	UPS will pick up for a 5 charge in most areas
