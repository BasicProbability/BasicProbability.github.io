So does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS60 is worth upgrading to
How good is its compression and can it be turned onoff at will
Any other nicenasty features
 
According to reports if you dont have DOS yet and dont have any
utilities QEMM Stacker PCTools Norton  then DOS6 may be worth it 
For people who have DOS5 and some sort of utility DOS6 doesnt offer
much Youd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create however 

	IMHO it seems to be worth the 40 to upgrade  DoubleSpace seems a bit 
saner than Stacker 20 which Ive replaced  MemMaker is nowhere near as 
aggressive as QEMM but it doesnt hose my system like QEMM did at least
it hasnt yet  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version or a 
reasonably recent one of CPAV  mine was very aged so this was quite welcome

 	MSDOS 60 aint the end all be all of operating systems  but its
better than a sharp stick in the eye unless you happen to be into that sort 
of thing
