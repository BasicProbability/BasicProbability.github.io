Subject IRWIN 250 owners dont miss this deal on tapes


IRWIN suggests the use of preformatted tapes for their tape drives as
you often cant successfully format a tape and need  bulkerase it before
you can format it again Anyway I have some new preformatted tapes for
IRWIN 250 tape drives 
IRWIN accuTRAK series 120250MB 16ea New never used
3M DC2120 RHOMAT Format  16ea Wraped
