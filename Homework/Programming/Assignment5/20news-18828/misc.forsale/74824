I have for sale Quicken 30 PC Version that allows you to balance
                         
i assume you get new releases earlier than we do here last i saw version
20 was the latest

He is probably referring to the DOS version the dos versions is up
to like version 6 i think  The window version just came out recently
so it is only up to like version 2 or something
