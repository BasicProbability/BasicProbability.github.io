So does anyone care to enlighten us whether DOS60 is worth upgrading to
How good is its compression and can it be turned onoff at will
Any other nicenasty features

According to reports if you dont have DOS yet and dont have any
utilities QEMM Stacker PCTools Norton  then DOS6 may be worth it 

For people who have DOS5 and some sort of utility DOS6 doesnt offer
much Youd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create however 

i installed dos 6 last week and had nothing but trouble afterwards
windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
to a pinata and it does not seem to like to work with NDOS norton 
dos 70  other probs include

set pcplusdpcplus for procomm plus no longer works
many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
	either mostly shareware

i now have uninstalled dos 6  and dos 5 works just fine
are there any apps that dos 6 will be able to run that dos 5 wont
