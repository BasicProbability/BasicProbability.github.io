	Its an experiment place a not so subliminal slightly
cagey message in front of a viewer and see how long it takes to create a response and what was the response
	It was the same thing with the Blow me message only it had a
quicker response timeand some unexpected responses along with the
expectedly negative ones
	Anyone see how long that took
