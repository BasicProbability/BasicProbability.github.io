Oh dear  Let me be the first on my block

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups
youre not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise of any kind people frequently get flamed for announcing
theyve got a new book out

I dont know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long
standing custom and it doesnt make much difference from a practical
point of view

So please dont do it again

And all you others who are even now taking keyboard in hand to flame
him off the face of the earthlay off  He didnt know any better
He does now
