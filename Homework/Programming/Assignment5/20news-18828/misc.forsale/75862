 Dont bother  it never comes  Its a cheap trick for building a
 mailing list to sell if my junk mail flow is any indication
 
 andy sent his address months ago

Perhaps we can get Portal to nuke this weasal  I never received a 
catalog either  If that person doesnt respond to a growing flame then 
we can assume that weyall look forward to lotsa junk mail

I dont want him nuked I want him to be honest  The junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog  If Id known
what I was going to get I wouldnt have hesitated  I wouldnt be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
nope but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results
Similarly there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
arent happy with the junk they got instead

The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad and
so would the people reading it
