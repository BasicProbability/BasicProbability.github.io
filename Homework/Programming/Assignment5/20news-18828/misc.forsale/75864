Subject Pressure meter

Heise model 710A pressure meter This is a precision 412
digit meter measuring 0  15 PSI absolute in 001 psi
increments  Case is in extremely good shape and can be used
as a standalone meter or panel mounted Brass fitting looks
like standard 38 on back Operates from 110 VAC

Id like 50 for it or make an offer It is a lot more useful to
a lab than as an ersatz barometer which is what Ive been using
it for
