The car has required no major repair work in the more than ten years I have
owned it It has never failed to start or broken down even in the coldest

shows every sign of staying that way Yet it is an absolute thrill to drive
when you take it to secluded twisty mountain road I sell it now
reluctantly since I just succumbed to the convertible craving and bought a
new Miata
