I just love these posts from the exSoviet Union  Among the cars dinette
sets video cameras etc every now and then an ad pops up for bee venom
RED OXIDE OF MERCURY cobalt 100 tons minimum order etc  Dont they
have garage sales in Russia   


It really doesnt strike me as very funny It is rather indicative of what
a crisis their economy is in I imagine they are in desparate need of
markets to sustain industries and people which are nolonger under central
control of the government
