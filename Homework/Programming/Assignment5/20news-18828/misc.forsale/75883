For example I subscribe to 2 magazines ABC news and XYZ products
I give my name as Joseph X Cool for the first and Joe Q Cool for
the 2nd When I get junk mail addressed to Joseph X  Cool I know
where they bought my name

This doesnt help NOT getting junk mail but you at least know whos
selling your name And if you ask companies to NOT sell your name to
mailing liststelemarketeers they are not supposed to as in its
illegal

And in case you havent guessed I dont really use Joe Cool



My company maintains a 20000 mailing list which is regularly rented for
one time use by the major software companies  The method you are using to
seed your junk mail isnt really effective  Bulk mailers regulary 
either send their databases to be cleaned by the NCOA which if youve
moved recently will revert back to the original xxx Cool and in large
mailings there will likely be a dupe of you and theyll pick the first and use the
others for future mailings
 
BTW our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
a MS Windows utility product in the 100 range and is available through
Direct Media in CT at 010 per name  Please let your direct mail
marketing rep know about this  Thanks
