Subject Top of the line JVC portable disc player for sale

I have used JVCs top of the line portable cd player for three months now
I have mostly used it in my car on long trips so it has less than 20 hours of use on it  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to but
I am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car

Features include
	17 Hz  20000 Hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	AC adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		25 presets 5 user programmable
	RCA connections and cord
	JVC compulink capability cord included
	programmable from remote
	intro random repeat playback

I will include a Discwasher tm power converter to convert an automobiles
12v DC to the 55V DC that the unit requires  I had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at Radio Shack etc

I paid 235 for the disc player and another 30 for the power converter
I will sell the disc player alone for 180 or both items for 190
