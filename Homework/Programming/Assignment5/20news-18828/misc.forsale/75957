Subject Panasonic dot matrix printer 165 complete


I would like to sell my dot matrix printer so I can upgrade to inkjet
It is a Panasonic KXP1124 24 pin MultiMode Printer  Here are the
stats from memory and the manual

  360x360 dotprinting for hires graphics etc
  VERY fast up to 192 cps printing in printercontrolled as
	opposed to Windows drivercontrolled printing
  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed
  5 fonts courierprestigebold psscriptsans serif
  Epson LQ2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation
  Can accept single sheets envelopes and 3 noncarbon copies by
	friction feed
  Front or bottom paper feed
  6KB buffer

I will send a sample document and a printed GIFJPEG file to anyone
who wishes to send a SASE  With purchase prepaid please I will
include the following accessories

  Manual
  cable Centronics
  remaining stack of tractorfed paper about 4
  FREE copy of Windows printer driver unless this is illegal or if
	it is included with Windows
  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program 2 registration I think
	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities
	from DOS

The last two will be on a disk either size  I am asking for around
165 but I am open to any reasonable offers  I am a college
student so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
considerable portion of the money from this printer  This price
includes all above items and shipping probably UPS is included as
well  I have the original box but only one of the original Styrofoam
end pieces  I will use a towel on the other end you get a free towel
too  Worked fine getting it here  The whole shebang might not fit
in the original box I will figure this out after the offers come in
Email any questions and offers		Jon
