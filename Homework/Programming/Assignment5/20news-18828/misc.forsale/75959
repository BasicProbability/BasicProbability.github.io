	WAV sound file driver  For those of you that are
	using your PC Speaker for games this will be a much
	welcomed board for your PC

	7000 includes shipping to your home or office

	Email bitzmcolumbiadsuedu

	Considering that you can get a brand new Sounds Blaster
original for around 80 I think this price is way too high  Then
again things are worth what someone is will to pay for them
