Subject SLS Linux for sale disktape



Since I have some free time while looking for a job I thought 
I would offer Linux on disk and tape for those who need it


NOTE I am offering this service for EXPERIENCED users who 
require no support  Simply put I am just a disk shuffler  If 
you think you will need support I HIGHLY recommend  
Softlanding Linux System SLS directly  They provide an
excellent product at a decent price with support

I am the lazy mans service for those who dont want to spend 
4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies  And 
those who dont need SLS support and opt to go it alone
