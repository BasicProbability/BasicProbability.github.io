4 month old Sega Genesis barely used one controller in original
box with Sonics 1 and 2  130 gets the whole bundle shipped to you

Turns out theyre not as addictive when theyre yours  Anyway mail me if 
youre interested in this marvel of modern technology

Well Ive been informed that the price on the whole thing Im selling is now
less than the price Im selling it for  That will teach me to wait that long
before getting rid of electronic equipment  Nevermind everyone Im keeping
the thing
