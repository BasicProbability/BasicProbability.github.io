Oh dear  Let me be the first on my block

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups
                                         
 	nit Is he unable to type the first h in this word 

youre not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise of any kind people frequently get flamed for announcing
theyve got a new book out

I dont know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long
standing custom and it doesnt make much difference from a practical
point of view


	As a matter of fact DJ it does make a difference
	Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year
	many of them are commercial businesses The ban on commercial
	use of Internet is no more

	One should have the breeding not to post commercial material
	on an account provided by ones employer or school unless the
	provider of such account gives permission HA

	Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	by our innate good taste and no have no administrator to 
	guide us
