Subject TCDD3 DAT Walkman For Sale

        I recently backed out of purchasing an almostunused Sony TCDD3 DAT
Walkman having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer and am
paying more for  However its still a heck of a machine for the price  it
is quite rugged and many people out there swear by it  Its probably the
most popular walkmanstyle DAT machine out there

        Anyway the guy selling it is Bryan Davis bdavisnetcomcom and
heres what he told me


Here is what is included
         TCDD3 DATman
         2 RCA to Stereo 18 plug cables  One for analog input one for
          analog output
         Optical digital IO cable one lead for input one for output
         A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase  The
          unit is still under factory warrantee
         AC adaptorbattery charger
         Rechargable battery

I paid 750  tax for it so I hope you dont mind if I keep the 60 minute
tape it came with I have some samples on it

By the way he spent at least 100 too much for it unless hes including an
 extended warranty which is advised for DAT machines since it costs about
 300 to replace the head when it wears out and it probably will within 5
 years if you use it a lot  davisonj


        Im not going to quote my sale price for him that would not be nice
Send him mail and ask him what he wants

        Again Ive used the TCDD3 and I have to say that I can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is  Ive been using one for a little
while and although I had some problems with it recently I should also point
out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been used during that time  This is the same exact DAT machine
that was lugged around the US and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher
Conspiracy for their recent live album

        Bryan Davis says

I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in SF who use that model and have been for a while with no reported
problem  My problem is that everyone I know already has one


        nuff said

        The reason Im not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a
unit that features phonoplug SPDIF IO instead of optical I dont have any
optical ports on my equipment but you the reader might and it also has
some other bells  whistles that the TCDD3 doesnt  I am also paying more
for the alternative  Note that phonoplugtooptical SPDIF adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one

        Of course it has SCMS  All consumer decks do  So do Sony Minidiscs
by the way

        Anyway if youre interested get in touch with bdavisnetcomcom
