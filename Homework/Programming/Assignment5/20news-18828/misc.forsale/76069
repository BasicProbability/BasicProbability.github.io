 Quantum 105MB 35 internal ProDrive hard disk
   This unit has recently turned unreliable and erratic in usage
   Could be a simple easily fixed problem or a major problem
   but at any rate I dont have the time to find out where the
   problem lies  If you want to take a risk on it you can have
   it for 45  shipping

Forgot to mention that the above mentioned Quantum is a SCSI
drive
