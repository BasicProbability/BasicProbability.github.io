   Both Space Ace and Dragons Lair II 750

 
   These games require a Sony 1450 Laserdisc player  The
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal Laserdisc movies on it as well  I have one which I
will sell for 600 by itself 550 with a purchase of one
complete system or 500 if you buy both systems
 
    I currently run this into my entertainment center  I have
it housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan and 
power supply  I run the audio into my stereo system and the
laserdisc runs directly into the TV  I have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons  First person who buys both
games will get it all otherwise you have to do it yourself
 
    If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well  The graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet
 
    Everything works perfectly  The laserdisc player has an
RS232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them
 
    If you are interested please email me
 
    Thanks
