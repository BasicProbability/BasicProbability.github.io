 If you would like to buy any of the above items please mail me
 at jackacsbuedu Also a 10 automatic discount will apply if
 your total purchase price is 100 or more except the two brand
 new items Buyers pay shipping
 
 If you think the prices I listed above is unrealistic please mail
 me back and I would take your advice into consideration and make the
 proper adjustments

 The reason I am selling this stuff is because I have decided that
 I had enough with this hobby of PC computing and I want to move on
 other interests

 One last thing if you know any nonprofit organization whom might
 be interested in my equipments please let me know Because if no
 one wants to buy them I might as well donate them and get a tax
 break

 Thanks
