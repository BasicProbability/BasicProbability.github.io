Im sure that the Motorola is worth it but this kind of thing
has always mystified me  400 is the price of very good new
dualband fully synthasized HT  Yes yes I know Motorola
HTs are bulletproof unbreakable plutoniumbased 
indestructable  you can drive a tank over them and theyll
still work  But just how often does that come up  Why are hams
willing and they are to spend the price of a synthaszied
dualbander for a 2channel xtal rig  Note this is not
a flame as I said Im sure this is a good deal for this rig
Im just amazed that it is a good deal  I would have guessed
that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual
bander to a ham no matter how durable Just shows you how wrong
I can be
