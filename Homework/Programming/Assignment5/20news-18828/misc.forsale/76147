It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products
In addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail  
Am I correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use

	Well Dale Id say offhand Keelhauling would work pretty
wellwe havent had a good keelhauling in a long time Sorry it came up in a conversation yesterday and well I just love that phrase
	Or maybe just ask for folks to flood the guys mailbox with
the FAQ for netetiquittesort of poetic justice for all the junk mail
he was trying to generate anyway
