Subject Photo Stuff Forsale


 
Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses cameras and photo stuff
thats not being used  Some are gems some are mundane
 
 
Minolta AF 5017 lens for Maxxum cameras  New lens but I guess itd
be best to call it a demo since I did not get the literature box or
warranty cards  30
 
Vivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses  Pretty cute flip back
tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses  and bodies
It will even couple and double a nonAI lens to an AI body  15
 
Pentax 5014 screwmount lens  Well actually its a SuperTakumar which
is what they all were back then  Very mint condition  25 Nice hard
case for this lens 5 more
 
Alpex 13528 lens  Beautifully made all metal construction with fine
optics  Minolta mount  25  Another hard case that fits this with
strap can be addedcall it 7 more
 
Vivitar 283 flash  The one that made Vivitar famous until the 285
eclipsed it  Tilt head removable sensor variable auto exposure
30
 
Universal Roamer 63 folding old bellows camera with leather case
Uses 120 or 620 film 100mm F63 lens  Kinda cool articulated shutter
release  Decent shape  20
 
Weston 540 lightmeter  Nothin super fancy but it works well and is a
good cross check to built in meters  7 with case and strap
 
And finallythe gems
 
Pentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F28 lens  This is the little
and I do mean TINY SLR that Pentax made  Has interchangeable lenses
but try and find the 2040 zoom true through the lens viewing with
split image focus and completely auto exposure  70
 
Olympus 35RC rangefinder camera  A really cute little camera with 42mm
lens F28 with built in manual or auto exposure self timer etc  I
think this was the predecessor to the XA  and its nearly all metal
I wont mind holding onto this one if it doesnt sell  60
 
Olympus OM1 with flash shoe leatherette case 5014 Zuiko lens and
Tokina SD Super Dispersion 70210 lens  These are all in very nice to
mint condition except for one little ding on the OM body near the film
advance lever  Lenses are perfect and the Tokina is a very compact
and sharp lens  225 for the set
 
 
Thatll do to clean out some of the stuff  Feel free to offer on this
stuff although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it
