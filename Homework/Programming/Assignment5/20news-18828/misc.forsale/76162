Fellow netters

I have an Okidata printer I would like to sell  A description follows

Okidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles Centronics
parallel and Commodore RS232  round  Also includes power cable manual
and a handful of computer paper to get you started  This is a 9pin printer 
I recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon  A print sample 
can be provided upon request  This is a very dependable printer  it never
jams or does weird things  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx  I use mainly WordPerfect 51 see next
post for which I got a driver at no charge that directly supports the 
Okidata 180 in Epson FX mode 

When I got the printer it was selling for around 200220 new I got mine
from Tenex brand new  for a Christmas present  I would like to get about
100 or so for it  If you are interested at all in it please give me a ring
