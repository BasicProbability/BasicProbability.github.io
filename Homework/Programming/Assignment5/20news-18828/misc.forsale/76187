My little Nash has sat for about a year had been running but now I must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me  Here are the
details of the car

1958 HardtopExterior condition
     Rocker panels rusted out at weld points no rust at typical spots like
     door hinge mounting points back battery box etc  Missing front bumper
     front pan dented up one weld popped in front  This is for the most part
     a solid restorable automobile

     Interior Condition
     Missing original steering wheel has one of the smaller aftermarket
     wheels seats need reupholstered general fair condition

     Mechanical Condition
     Had been running but now does not want to startneeds new rings which
     I have also have extra parts such as complete long block extra steering
     shaft etc

For a car that has not been touched since 1958 it is in solid shape  It will
obviously need some work but will make a good project

PRICE  Well this is a tough one I would like to get around 80000 but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it If you 
have things to trade such as tools toys cameras comics cards etc 
anything easily movable to Florida I may consider that as well
