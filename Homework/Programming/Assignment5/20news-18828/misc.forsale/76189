Subject Wanted TB Samplevision driver for SMDIPeavey DPMSPSX


   Is there anyone out there with a copy of the driver for Turtle
Beachs Samplevision program that allows you to use a Always Tech
IN2000 SCSI card to do SMDI dumps between your PC and your
Peavey DPMSP  SX  SX2   

   This is normally only available directly from Turtle Beach but I
was just wondering if there was someone who got it and couldnt
find a use for it

   If you have a copy let me know
