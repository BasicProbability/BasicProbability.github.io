   The Catalog of Personal Computing Tools for Engineers and Scien
   tists lists hardware cards and application software packages for 
   PCXTATPS2 class machines  Focus is on engineering and scien
   tific applications of PCs such as data acquisitioncontrol 
   design automation and data analysis and presentation  

   If you would like a free copy reply with your U S Postal 
   mailing address

Dont bother  it never comes  Its a cheap trick for building a
mailing list to sell if my junk mail flow is any indication

I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this
It does have tons of qool stuff in it 

Thats one  Any others

My impression is that they try not to send it out to browsers

Then they should have used a different advert

It appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you

Im both  Ive made some 4k worth of PC products purchasing
decisions for one company Im affiliated with in the past 6 months
alone  In a delicious bit of irony an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that I suspect got my mailing address from these people
More is in the pipeline right now

If they wanted to discuss these sorts of things upfront is the
way to do it

When you get a catalog theres a VIP Code you

And who issues that VIP Code  That policy implementation in the
running for this weeks silly twit award  BTW  It turns out that
I have several VIP codes  Heres the one Im using for these sorts of
things 6  If you want one send me mail and Ill put you in touch
with the folks who do the application interview if you qualify
