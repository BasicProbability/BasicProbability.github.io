It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products

The net is not supposed to be a dumping ground for free ads but
reserving it for tripe doesnt seem to be a significant improvement

In addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail  

So  Either they target it well enough to pay for it in other words
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff in which case it
is junk only for the rest and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case or they go bankrupt  Seems fair to me

Am I correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use

You could hold your breath  You could kill offending messages as
they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further
but not until you turn blue
