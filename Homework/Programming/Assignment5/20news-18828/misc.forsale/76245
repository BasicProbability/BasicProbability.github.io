I have recently converted to Microsoft Visual C
 
I no longer want my Borland C 31 wApplication Frameworks product
 
This version is about 6 months old I have all of the manuals disks 525
etc It is licensed to me but I will transfer the license to the purchaser
under the accepted terms of the Borland license agreement
 

The list price for the product is about 750 I have seen it advertised for as
low as 500 
 
I will accept the best offer over 375 plus shipping as described above which
is 12 the list price plus Im tossing in the 2 books listed above which are
a 70 value

Ill sell mine for 200 OBO    Never Used Ive decided I just dont 
have the time to get into C
