Subject Digital Voice Processor For Sale


Hi All

I have a Korg DVP1 for sale for 30000  shipping  For those whove not
had the pleasure

It is a MIDI controlled no keyboard of its own rackmountable digital voice
processor  What can it do with your voice  It can pitchshift it change the
notes you sing  It can add harmonies to your singing up to 5 parts at one
time  It can change your voice into a synthesizers voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible  This works well for a computerized sounding
singer or robot voice  For those of you who just thought about that yes 
you can do the voices from RoboCop and the old ELO leadins with it and yes 
Im a little redfaced to say that I tried those specifically  For an input
it takes both XLR 3prong mic and 14 cables  For output you can have
a combination of the originalinputonly and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect can be effect only if desired  It has preset
setups which you can edit and save for your own preferences  It has a couple
of light scratches but does not look bad and works flawlessly  Even when we
dont use it in my music its been good for afterhours fun in the studio
The manual is included  I never got around to getting rackears for it but
it has only gotten studio use from me  no roading so its not beaten
