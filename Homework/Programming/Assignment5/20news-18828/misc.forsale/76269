        Purchased locally at Micro Center in Columbus OH 7 months ago  All
	original packaging receipts and manuals are included   Under
        warranty   The keyboard on this machine is the best Ive seen I
	prefer it to the keyboard on most desktop units I typically
        get 34 hours of battery life  The battery recharges in 2 hours to 
        full charge   The machine is quite speedy I run OS2 21beta
	on it currently and will leave this operating system installed unless
	you prefer MSDOS 50 included
   
        Ill include a padded carrying case also made by Toshiba

	pay for COD shipping
