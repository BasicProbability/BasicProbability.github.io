Subject  FOOT SWITCHES AND GUITAR 


	Ive got 2 foot switches for sale  They appear to be designed
for studio use ie theyre very well built  1 in diameter 6
cord  Id like 15 but Id also like to sell them so make me an
offer

	Also I just bought a new Ibanez guitar so I need to sell one
of my others  Its a Kramer with passive EMG pickups 2 single one
double  These pickups sound GREAT and are whisperquiet  Id like
to get 250 for it
