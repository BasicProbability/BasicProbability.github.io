Subject Re QuestionSuggestion for Everyone  Please Read


If both paries do this then the transaction will obviously 
be COD  This allows both parties to exercise the amount of
trust they see fit


COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 15000
for a brick Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a COD its fine till a stop payment is made There are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction Even with
merchants and customers there are problemsstolen credit cards 
chargebacks no return policies and getting the wrong item etc

About the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trustsomeone who has been around for a while
