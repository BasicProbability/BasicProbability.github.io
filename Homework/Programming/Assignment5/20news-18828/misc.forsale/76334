Subject WANTED   Pasadenas Cassette or CD


A very good RB group came out in 1988 called the Pasadenas  I bought their
cassette single and fell in love with it  Ive tried to find their LP
or CD but have had no success whatsoever  Just wondering whether anyone
out in Netland had heard of them

their song that hit the charts was called Tribute


thanks
