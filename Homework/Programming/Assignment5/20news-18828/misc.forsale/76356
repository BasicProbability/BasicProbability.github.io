Subject New 3M and used 8 floppy disks for sale

	I have some brandnew shrinkwrapped boxes of 8 floppy disks that I
would like to sell  They are all 3M disks

40 4 boxes of 10 SSSD 8 floppy disks
60 6 boxes of 10 DSDD WWP 8 floppy disks

Misco is selling the SSSD 3M disks for 2590 for a box of ten and they are
selling the DSDD 3M disks for 3190 for a box of ten  I will take the
best offer I can get for the disks as many boxes as you want

	I also have a quantity of 8 floppy disks that 
some people were getting rid of probably due to an upgrade to a newer drive
system  All the disks are used and most have labels on them but they all 
appear to be in good physical shape  However I make no guarantees of the
quality of these disks  Here are the statistics

Quantity	Make	Type

66		Memorex Single sideDouble densitysoft sector128 bytesrecord

I will accept the best offer I receive for the disks and Im willing to sell
them off in different amounts the minimum being a box of ten if I get no
offers on these disks I would considering throwing them in with the new
disks Im selling above 

I also have a headcleaning kit for 8 disk drives for which I will take
the best offer I can get

All sales are final

I would prefer to ship COD and add the shipping costs onto the total order
