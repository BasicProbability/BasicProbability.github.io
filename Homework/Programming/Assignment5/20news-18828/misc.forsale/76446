Please do not postemail saying but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone
38690 for only 995 including a free toaster I am certain you can
find a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat New Micronics
CPUs command a severalhundred dollar premium because they are USmade
use highquality components and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and
Zeos at various points in the past Check out the ads in the back pages
of Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself

power supply The board is fully guaranteed Email for further details
