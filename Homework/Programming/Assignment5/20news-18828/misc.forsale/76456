Subject SALEbulk enviro Tshirts

I am not a company thus this is not a commercial sale  

I purchased 256 Tshirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through 
We didnt have the time to sell the shirts  I have about 175 shirts
left and I am willing to sell them to you for 525 a piece more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts
even in bulk  Thats 91875 for 175 shirts  These shirts are Jim
Morris Tshirts  They are all 100 cotton and most have more than 4
colors  They are clean and neatly folded in a box  If any happen to
be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it your option  You could sell them for at least 8 to 15 a piece
the higher number is for the nicer shirts to raise money for a school
event or a organization  I realize it is a big investment but it could
pay off big

I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at 550 a
shirt  I will pay shipping but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power

Please help me  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need
the money  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap  I will give
you Jim Morris phone number so that you can varify the prices

All prices are negotiable

Truman
