Subject For Sale UREI 527A 27band Equalizer

I have a UREI 527A 27band mono Equilizer for sale  Anyone who knows
this unit knows its been a recording studio standard for years  Its a
pretty straightforward unit with balanced ins and outs  Power supply caps
were recently replaced and I added XLR connectors which can be easily
removed if you prefer as I mounted them on a bracket outside the case 
The unit is in good shape and is sonically very clean

Im asking 225  UPS shipping  Theyre going for 250 generally  Make me
an offer
