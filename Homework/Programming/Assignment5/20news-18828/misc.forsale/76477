 486DX33 CPU chip for sale 250shipping  If you like to pay 250 for the
 chip you will get it immediately  Otherwise I will take the highest offer
 in a few days  Thanks
 
Please refer to 7870 he is selling 150 for that CPU

Correct  150 may be high now that AMD has started selling 486 clones


Youre both dreaming That guy who is selling at 150 is ripping himself off and
once those chips are gone itll be a while before you see that price again AMD
or not A clone is still a clone if you want the genuine article then you pay
for it Just because one guy decides to sell at a ridiculously low price doesntmean everyone else has to

I have been quoted a price from a local dealer friend of mine that I could get a 
Motherboard 386DX33 with 64K cache with 1 meg base ram for 285 

	Here is some friendly advice go to your favorite book store Walden Books
and pick up a Computer Shoppers Guide

	You think that was aa good price wait till you see some of the OTHER goodies they sell
