Subject Physically sound LP RECORDS 4 sale trade or barter


I still have about 70 records left on hand all in pristine condition
except where noted quite a few outofprint and more than a few
imports in the bunch

Rather than selling the majority for 34 each Im looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over USENET  Ill also
trade for other records in very good condition that youve replaced
with CD as well as prerecorded videos on Beta or VHS  In the past
Ive been able to make deals based on the equivalent liststore price
eg 1 CD  1 movie in Beta format to get around what you or I
might have originally paid as if we can even remember   

At this time Im looking for a set of working AA NiCad rechargable
batteries  if you have some lying around and theyre sound RSVP

So if youre curious RSVP for my list and if you see anything that
you like send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff youre selling  thanks

gld

 ie the imports and outofprints are also valued at 1 used CD

 I once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records list 81
Anybody got a nice unused blender for making frozen margaritas 

PS There have been NO additions since the last posting in February
        the list has only shrunk as Ive made a few deals since

 Je me souviens
