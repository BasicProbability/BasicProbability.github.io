Subject 12 record singles for sale


	Im selling a bunch of my older 12 records off  They are
sitting around collecting dust and I never use them  I have used each
of these records once maybe twice if I didnt record the song I
wanted correctly the first time  These records are in PERFECT
condition  Please email me with the records you would want and what
you think a fair price is  I will probably give deals the more
records you buy  Kinda capatalist isnt it  Well give me a yell at 
pagormiastateedu with any comments  
						See ya 
						Paul
	I have recieved a few questions as to what 12 are  I guess I
should elaborate   am I that old  They are just
maxisingles on wax  If I am correct most beat mixers still use this
form of record  This is probably the kind of person interested in
this colllect or parts of it Any questions call 515 2943737
Thanks and see ya
