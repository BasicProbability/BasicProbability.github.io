Computer Equipment Garage Sale

Ive finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me  Ive put together a list and
indicated what I think each item is worth  This is just my estimate and I
am very open to any offers including trades  Im currently looking for
some CDROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies HD floppy 
disks any used Macintosh software a 38733Mhz CoProcessor or basically 
anything you have lying around cans of soup the neighbors cat etc  
Make me an offer no offer will be overlooked 
I really want to get rid of this stuff

Ok Heres the list

52 Meg 35 SCSI Hard Drive  Conner Model CP3150  I bought this from a guy
	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh  Unfortunately I cant seem 
	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer  The
	guy tested it with his PC and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk 
	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors Ill send you a copy 
	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number so I cant return it to 
	him The drive has many jumpers on it which I dont know how to set 
	so maybe thats the problem  I was quite disappointed that it didnt
	work so Im trying to minimize my losses	45

52 Meg 35 SCSI Hard Drive Conner Model CP3150  Same situation as above
	I bought both of these drives from the same guy  Despite the different
	model numbers they are the same exact drive  Same report from NDD
	I have one for each drive will be included	45

40 Meg SONY 35 SCSI Hard Drive  SONY Model SRD2040A  The drive mechanism 
	is completely trashed  This hard drive was in my computer Mac SE and
	had a stiction problem  Well repeated banging on the side of the
	computer resulted in a head crash yes metal scraping metal which
	was not too pleasant to listen to  Still the SCSI controller
	card is in good working order and can be used for parts or a 
	project	20

65 Meg Seagate 525 HH SCSI Hard Drive  Model ST277N  I originally bought
	this drive because it had a small stiction problem and I though that
	I could fix it  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine
	and that it was a controller problem  motor controller wasnt sending
	proper signals  Well after taking the controller off the drive 
	looking at it and putting it back together I realized that I
	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
	drive to the controller  I tried to solder it but Im not that good
	at soldering so I couldnt do it  Worked perfectly before I messed
	up  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY above crashed on
	me  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications
	worth well over 1000  Claris CAD MS Word 50 Think C
	Excel and many others 
	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable  You also get all
	the software on the drive if you can accept being a pirate  I only 
	ask that you delete my data files from the drive  I was really angry
	when I broke that connection and then couldnt fix it  I just dont 
	have time to play with it any more	65

ATT ISDN 7500 Modem  This is for use on digital phone systems  If you know
	what this is or would like technical information on it let me know  I
	have some tech documents on it  Is supposed to be the same thing as an
	ATT digital phone but without the phone part  It seems to be in  
	working order passes self test perfectly OK  I have no idea how 
	this is worth   Let me know if youre interested

Motorola 68881 CoProcessor  I havent tested this one out yet but if anyone 
	is interested I will get it tested out to make sure that it works  I
	had trouble using it with my accelerator board but then I spoke to the
	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldnt be used without 
	another controller chip  When I was looking around to buy one new the
	prices were around 100  I will guarantee this to work	65

CGA Card  HalfLength 8bit  Wasnt working last time I checked although
	I think I was using a bad monitor	5

525	360K Floppy Drive  IBM Drive Type 1355  Guaranteed to work 
	because when I took it out of the PC it was working		25

525 360K Floppy Drive  Toshiba Model Number ND08DEA  Guaranteed to 
	work  Came out of same PC as above	25

525	Floppy Drives  Cant guarantee that these will work  I dont
	even know if they are low or high density drives  I dont have
	any method of testing them
		Panasonic Model number JU4555 ACG  Theres another
			number on it 2626361723
		Panasonic Model number JU4752 AGG  Theres also
			another number on it H3649101457
		Toshiba Model Number ND08DE  Virtually identical to the one 
			above
	Each Drive 10

35 PS2 Drive  These things are proprietary so I cant test it but I
	think it works  Not sure if its high density or low density but I
	suppose someone who is looking for one would know  Model Number
	DFL413C04A  I think these things are expensive to replace  35

MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards  Ive got three of these and I have no way
	of testing them  Two of them are 8bit cards and one is a sixteen bit
	card with a floppy controller built in	10 for the 8bits 15 for
	the 16bit card wfloppy

Interesting cable  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug  That is
	standard ninepin to VGA 15 pin Made by Hewlett Packard  Part No
	D118180020		10



Ive sold stuff like this before and it was a huge success with many 
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didnt need anymore  I 
usually ship through the US Postal Service havent had any problems yet 
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated

Well thats all folks  As I said before no offer will be refused  If you 
can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out TRY  I hate
to throw away stuff
