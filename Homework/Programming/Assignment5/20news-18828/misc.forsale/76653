This posting reminded me about a longstanding question Ive had
Does it
pay to consider an underwater camera for pictures taken on land but
in
harsh environments eg rain snow heat cold mud dust Or are
the
lenses etc all tuned for the refractive index of water

I have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988 Unfortunately it is no longer
made It is a P  S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet It
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions It takes AA batteries hooray It has the solid
heavy feel of oldstyle Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have
been able to give it This includes a lot of water rain river and
sea desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didnt scare the mugger away hitting him with the flying camera
did This is my never be without a camera camera The current
waterresistant Sport Touch I think is the name model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed
