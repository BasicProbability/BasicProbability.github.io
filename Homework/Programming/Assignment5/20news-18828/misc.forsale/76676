Using Borland C 3 2nd ed Mark  Lee Atkinson Que  2995

Id like to do is sell it all to the highest bidder under the conditions listed
below

Ill ship COD to anywhere in the US via the shipper of your choice
provided they are local to me and I will pay the COD charges you just pay
for the shipping

The list price for the product is about 750 I have seen it advertised for as
low as 500 

I will accept the best offer over 375 plus shipping as described above which
