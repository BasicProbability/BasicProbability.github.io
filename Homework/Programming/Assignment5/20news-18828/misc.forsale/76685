Subject Tapes and serial cables

Its basement cleaning time  This stuff has got to go

I have two boxes of 9 track 2400 tapes around 20 tapesbox  They are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up  Theyve seen
very little use  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship theyre yours
for the cost of shipping the cod charge and a 10 nusiance fee

I have a lot of serial cables  I have all kinds ribbon shielded long
short MM MF whatever you want  Most appear to work well with PC serial
ports but I will not gaurantee that  Tell me what you want and Ill do
the best I can to match  150 ea or 1010  Shipping included  No CODs
under 20  You want to pay a 5 COD charge for a 150 cable  Go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead itll be cheaper  I believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center  They appear
to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well

I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair probably
a logic board  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high  I think
they used to run a Prime system off of it  Best offer over 75 but you 
need to come pick it up  Use this to run your house from your solar panels

I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff
