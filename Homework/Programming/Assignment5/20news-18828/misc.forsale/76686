Subject WANTEDOLD 70s RECORD


 Im looking for an old album or cassette tape The group is SanfordTownsend
the name of the album is Smoke from a Distant Fire I think This album
came out somewhere around  197576 and I believe was the first album produced
by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up

If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it great If
you dont want to part with it but are willing to copy it onto cassette Id
love that too

Thanks

JK
