 CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE 

I have 3 highend car amplifiers for sale

2 OldStyle Rockford Fosgate 150s  These are great amps and Ive never
    had a minutes trouble with either of them  Ive been running them on
    high end for quite some time frontrear and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup but Ive also run them on low end before and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well  Im trying to sell
    them because Im considering upgrading to a Rockford 650  I already
    own a Power 300 and Ive always liked the way the 650300 combo worked
    in cars

    Im asking 20000 a piece and list on them when I bought them was
    37500  If youre interested in both of them Id be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit


1 Precision Power 2150  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150
    and looks brand new  The shroud is unscratched and it works great
    This is a great lowend amp because of its highpower rating into
    2 channels however Ive also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well

    Im asking 42500 for this amp but feel free to make me an offer on
    it
