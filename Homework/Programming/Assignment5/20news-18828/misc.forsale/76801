Ensoniq SQ80 CrossWave Synthesizer
I have an SQ80 for sale  The SQ80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited onboard sequencer  I bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire  it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more digital
Below are a list of features extracted from the owners manual
  o Eightvoice polyphonic polytimbral synthesizer capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o Voice section employing CrossWave synthesis  combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex dynamic sounds
  o 75 sampled waves includes a drumset serve as the sound source
  o Dynamic voice allocation  each sequencer trackMIDI channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o A fullfeatured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    MIDI program and volume changes at once  Keyboard is velocity
    sensitive and transmitsreceives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch
  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings
  o A 35 floppy disk drive which writesreads ordinary DSDD disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk  Also has a RAMcart slot
    for patches that is compatible with ESQ1 RAMcarts
  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device
  o 80 character fluorescent display and userfriendly pagedriven
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o Stereo lineouts and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ1
    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ1 can be played on
    the SQ80

This SQ80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while
now  It has performed ably in that role and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time  The SQ80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind and it works very well with my software sequencer
WinCake in its multitimbral mode

From a synthesis point of view this machine is a hybrid  It uses looped
short samples there are 75 of them as sources then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated DCFDCA arrangement  The SQ80
is capable of great things because of its 4pole analog lowpass filter
Simply put it makes fabulous analog synth sounds  But unlike most
good analog synths it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it
works very well with a MIDI sequencer  What I really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds
This SQ80 is about 5 years old mfg date 12188  It does have
an 8track sequencer but like most onboard sequencers it is a pain
to use so I have avoided it

REASON FOR SALE
I am selling my SQ80 because I recently joined forces with another individual
here in Boston and we have more keyboards than space to put them  I
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard

65000 average rmms asking price is 73300  I will include a bunch of
