HE IS A CROOK  DONT DEAL WITH HIM

Please Help

I am looking for Dana Weick  A month ago I made a deal with him over the
net  I was to sell him some memory in exchang for 100 and a 48666 cpu
I thought the deal was great so I went on with it  

I sent him the memory COD FOR 100  He was then suppose to send me the cpu
I receive his COD payment on 4893  He send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 41693  It has been two weeks and I didnt receive the CPU

I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship or
what address he send it to to make sure it didnt get lost in the mail
He never reply my mail  

I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona  The first call didnt get
throught I got  an answering machine  I left him my number  He didnt reply
I call again the next day and he pick up the phone  I asked him if he had
send out the cpu  He said yes but he doesnt know what address he sent it
to  

He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day
To my suprise He never called  I then send him some more email messages he
never reply again strang when the deal was being made he reply to every
of my message now that He got my memory He wont even reply to me

Now  I am still calling him but he wont pick up the phone  I am also still
      emailing him but he wont reply my mail

 72pin SIMMS arent hot sellers I pick them up on the upgrade market for
 140160 quite often  Best I can do is the 486DX266 and 100
 
 

Ok you got a deal Ill trade you 4 72pins SIMMs for an Intel 486DX266 AND
100  I need you address for shippment I will ship it via COD and I ll pay
shippinghandling  When the Simms arrive there will be a 100 charge on your
part  You can send the CPU to me via COD if possible

I would prefer US Mail 2nd Day Priority it only costs 290

The CPU is brand new install it correctly meaning dont plug it in
backwards or bend any pins and Ill warranty it for 6 months
Thanks

ON 48 I SEND HIM AND SAID
that I got the cod payment
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
Is the CPU sent out yet
HE REPLIEDON 49

Glad the COD payment got to you OK the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it  Be very careful when you install it be careful of static discharge
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation  The chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I wont be real
sympathetic 
 
If you dont know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed 
DONT GUESS


DANA WEICK UPDATE

I call him sunday his wife Debbie picked up the phone  She said that he was 
busy with his kids and he would call me back in 10 minuets  Half an house
went by Weick didnt called  I called him again and his phone was discon
nected

Since this post  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA
WEICK have ripped them off  We got do something about this guy  He has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now  And he is getting away
with it
