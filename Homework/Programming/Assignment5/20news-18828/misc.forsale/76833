  I used this setup to run AutoCad and 3D Studio  The combination of
 Local Bus and the Weitek coprocessor made for VERY fast CAD and modeling
 work  The Weitek coprocessor can cut 3D Studio render times in half and
 sometimes more  It also increases redraws and regens when modeling in
 both 3D Studio and Autocad  Everything is less than a year old  I am
 asking 95000  shipping for the whole package  Please respond via email
 Thanks
