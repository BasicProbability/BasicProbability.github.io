 I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
 there even outside of Iowa  Im sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
 space but I thought you might want some relief from the Soandso is a thief
 posts  Not that I think we shouldnt hear about the bad deals but it would be
 nice to hear some good news once in a while
 
 This was nice of Kevin to post this  But just so no one is misled the
 VAST MAJORITY of usenetters are honest and good people  In fact in
 the latest study 997 of all netdeals went off smoothly without a
 hitch  Its just that the few bad ones are what get all the publicity

      Agreed  I have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
      and I have bought things from CDs plenty to a full computer
      The only small problem that I have had was with UPS rather than
      the seller  Besides complaints are always what get the
      publicitywhen something goes wrong people complain  Rarely
      have I seen posts stating how well a deal went through  I guess
      Kevin is practically a first

                   Id rather be swimming
