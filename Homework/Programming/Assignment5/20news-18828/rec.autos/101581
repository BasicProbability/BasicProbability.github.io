Subject Re Are BMWs worth the price            

sure sounds like they got a ringer  the 325is i drove was definitely
faster than that  if you want to quote numbers my AW AutoFile shows
060 in 74 14 mile in 159  it quotes Car and Drivers figures
of 69 and 153  oh BTW these numbers are for the 325i

Car and Driver rated the 325is 1988 at 72 060  14 at 152 after 30k miles last time I checked 8

Automobile magazine rated new 325is 14 mile162

Gee  aint quotiin funner than the dickens

Sounds like we need a race  Ill let you have the newer version  Can someone out there lend me a 1988 325is for a day 8  I wont hurt it I promise

i dont know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it
but dont take my word for it  go drive it

Actually I will take your word on it  I refuse to test it new 325is because
I love BMWs and would probably want to buy it  Problem is my income just doesnt support that
