The silly thing about this whole argument is that most of the trunk
releases Im tempted to say all but theres bound to be a
counterexample only operate if the car is on ACC or running  Thus
you cant easily pop the trunk without starting the car

Most cars  The only cars Ive ever seen with this feature have been
GM cars  My 88 Mazda 80 Honda and coming soon 93 Probe all have
cableoperated releases   My 84
Camaro had an electric hatch release that was thankfully independent of
the key in the ignition the exception to the rule mentioned in my first
sentence

I should probably have said glovebox trunk releases  I havent
encountered any glovebox releases that are cable operated  Numerous
GM and several FordMercury cars that Ive encountered have electrical
releases in the glovebox and all of the ones Ive seen needed the
ignition on to some degree to operate  Your Camaro example is noted
but since its a hardtop its not a big deal  Ive never run into a
convertible with a cableoperated trunk release  Id agree 100 that
in such an environment a cable or alwaysactive electrical release
would be rather stupid

My Honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key
The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk
or enable the cable release

I remember my mothers 86 Corvette that had an electronic hatch release
located on the drivers door which was ALWAYS active  The fact that the
car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
disable the hatch release unnecessary
