2 There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20 fully
   loaded at dealer cost I have check this out and the numbers match
   up They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid1993
   version includes dual airbags and want to get rid of their old 1993s

is this really the dealers cost  did you get the dealers cost by
looking at the invoice  there may be factory to dealer incentives
id check this out since i have trouble believing that a dealer would
sell a car to me at his cost

dealer invoice is not necessarily the dealer cost
