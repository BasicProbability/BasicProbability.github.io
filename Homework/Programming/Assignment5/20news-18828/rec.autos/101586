Subject Re LH car order delay

In article 1993Apr21359261skclamonsantocom masskclamonsantocom writes
 I read an article in the 325 Chicago Tribune stating that Chrysler is
 having problems addressing the demand for the 35L engine for its LH
 cars  Can anyone post how long they are waiting for an ordered car or
 how long they have been told theyll have to wait
 
 Thanks
