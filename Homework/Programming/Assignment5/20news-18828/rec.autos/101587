Subject Re Dumbest automotive concepts of all time

Well you young fellers wont remember but we used to have side vent
front windows until some damn bean counter scrapped them These were
separate triangular windows at the leading edge of the front doors
that pivoted outward at the rear edge Worked like a charm
 
Yeah I loved the vent windows on my 82 Escort hell the only thing I liked
about the car  One of the things Id like to see brought back  Does
anyone know if theyre an option on the new Escorts
