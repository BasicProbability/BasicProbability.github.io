      Id like to add the Beretta GTZ as a car which will kick GSR butt
 anyday and its a lot cheaper to boot

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges somewhat like a Mustang 50
and a CRX both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers ie I dont think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa

stuff deleted

are all weather XGTV4 not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than

No Integra I have seen comes with allseason tires 
The GTZ does come with much bigger 16 wheels

along with the Integra and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
Your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine
Road  Track and Car Driver have the GSR at 68 to 80 for Road and Track

The CD figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype
supplied by Acura The MT figures are more plausible

Also Quarter mile times vary from 154 to 161
161 sounds reasonable probably faster than regular Integras

     So the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep
up with it in acceleration  And the Beretta probably has a higher top
speed due to the horsepower advantage 160117 hptorque for the
Integra vs 180160 for the Beretta
You always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive a GSR and see
for your self while the GSR has a low 117 torqye its high gearing over a 8000

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed

rpm make up for the difference still wouldnt call it a torque moster though

Considering you save almost 3000 dollars for the Beretta and the Quad4
is a reliable engine it doesnt make sense to get the Integra as a

The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon It
was a piecve of junk but very quick for FWD

Quad 4 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k
miles a rare screw up by Honda
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR
