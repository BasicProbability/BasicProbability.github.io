Subject Re MGBs and the real world

In article 1993Apr518105629411mkscom mikemkscom Mike Brookbank writes
My sister has an MGB  She has one from the last year they were produced
1978 1979  Its in very good shape  Ive been bugging her for years
about selling it  Ive said over and over that she should sell it
before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may
actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability


Grass Roots Motorsport 393 has a long article about MGBs this month
As far as collectivityspeculation is concerned they think it is a 
waste of time especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
desirable a 1962 original model the most The reasons for its low
value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good
car

Craig
Which one of us is right  Are there MGB affectionados out there who are
still willing to pay 6K to 8K for an old MG  Are there a lot out in the 
market
