KYTo all those who have PASSATs do you recommend using Super Unleaded or just
KYregular Unleaded Gasoline I have been using Regular Unleaded A friend of mine has
KYa Jetta and has always used Super Unleaded and thinks I should be using the same
KYhowever I believe the advantages of Super Unleaded for CARs 30000 and under
KYhas been overplayed by guess who the companies who sell them because that is
KYwhere they make the most PROFIT A Ralph Nader report and other consumer advocates
KYhave in the past spoken against those oil companies

Your Passat VR6 is designed to run on premium gasoline however the
engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
to the engine with lower octane fuel

You will likely however get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
especially in hot weather out of this particular engine if you do
run it on premium
