Has anybody noticed that Toyota has an uncanny knack for designing horrible
ugly station wagons  Tercels Corollas Camrys  Have their designers no
aesthetic sense at all
 
The new Camry Wagon may just be even uglier than my Tercel   

toyota has cornered the market on ugly station wagons
after seeing the new camry sedan i had thought toyota would
finally turn out something nicelooking  the new camry station
wagon bears a strong resemblance to a hearse and a weird looking
one at that
