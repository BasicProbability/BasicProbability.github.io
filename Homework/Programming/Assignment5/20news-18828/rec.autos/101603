 This has me thinking  Is there a biological reason why women cant put
 their keys in their pants pockets like men do  I have two pockets on the
 back of each of my pants  I put my keys in one and wallent in another
 Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely
 Everything is that much simpler for me  Why cant women do the same
 Is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
 a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents 

Oh PULLEEZE

Its not biology at all its clothing design  Womens clothing is
generally designed to be as nonfunctional as possible  Its only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy womens pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in  Previously deep pockets were
virtually unknown in womens clothing  Skirts generally have better
pockets now too  Dresses espcially fancy dresses are still pretty
hopeless  I often hand my drivers license over to my husband if were
dressed up to go out somewhere so I dont have to be encumbered by a
purse

If women consistently bought functional clothing and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional womens clothing I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures  Theres
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludis Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional womens clothing  The manufactuing industry
lost millions

From a woman who would rather buy mens clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than womens clothing without
