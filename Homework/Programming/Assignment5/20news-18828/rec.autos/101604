 I found a Mopar spec sheet this weekend

               model         wgt    hp
             Stealth         3086   164
             Stealth ES      3186   222
             Stealth RT      3373   222
             Stealth RT TT   3803   300

 Okay Ill take their word for it


 I am giving every chance to retract figures widely known The Mustang is
 rated at 205  222205 is 17 You have a 17hp advantage over a Mustang

 Seems that the 1993 Mustang 50 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford
 changed its testing procedures  Under the older procedures it still 
 rates closer to 225 hp  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more
 
 And you still havent posted any weight figures for the Mustang


 Big threat You are KOd by a Civic acording to CD 

 Yeah sure in your wet dreams  And thats probably where you got 
 that 112 second 060 for the Stealth


 Ill check CDs 591 issue  Strange that you claim to have that 

 Go ahead and check asshole youll realize what an idiot you are for not
 checking data beforeposting Car Drive may 91 Stealth ES 222hp
 automatic

 For 3 posts now youve been harping on this May 1991 issue of Car  Driver
 without posting any numbers  Why not  Because they prove me right and you
 aint got the guts to admit it  Yeah thought so


 The Sentra SER really is alot quicker than the 222hp FWD Sports car
 You are close to the 9k sentrae Go look up the numbers in CD  and
 report please

 No Im going to play your game 

       No way Sentras are SLOW  I took a test drive and it took
       217 to go 050  Why even the Hyundai Excel blows it doors
       off  Any 12 yr old knows that  I race and Ill kick your butt 
       blah blah blah

 Lets see   yep that sounds just like you 
 Oh man I just got it  Beavis  Butthead  thats you


 Who would buy a FWD automatic that costs 20K that is capable of only
 a 158 and would plainly be dusted by a SER

 I dunno why did you

 But why would someone pick the Dodge Stealth RT over the Nissan Sentra
 All it takes is one look
