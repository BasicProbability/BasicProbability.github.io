Well there is a difference

I dont happen to have my SAE manual handy but oil viscosity in general
decreases with temperature  The SAE numbers are based on a typical
curve that oils used to all have running from say the viscosity of a
roomtemperature 90weight at 0C down to say that of a roomtemperature 
5weight at 20C for a typical 40weight oil

Oils that are designed for operation in normal temperatures just have
a weight specification  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a W tacked on the end so in winter in a cold
place youd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year

Modern multiviscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature
As a result their viscosity graphs cross over several curves  A multivis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures a normal operating
temperature and a cold one though I cant remember the numbers

In any event the weights do indicate a significant difference  Remember
that your engine is temperatureregulated by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins most of the time  unless you overheat it or
something

Any weight of oil is better than no oil or than very old carbonized
oil  Thin oil wont in general lubricate as well at temperature
thicker oil will like a 20W50 will lubricate better at temperature 
but not as well during startup when most engine wear occurs  

If youre planning on making long drives the 20W50 is probably fine
esp in the summer in your 10W40 car  But if youre making short drives
stick to the 10W40



DONT DRINK SOAP DILUTE DILUTE OK
