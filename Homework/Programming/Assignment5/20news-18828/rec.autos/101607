 I found a Mopar spec sheet this weekend


               model         wgt    hp
             Stealth         3086   164
             Stealth ES      3186   222
             Stealth RT      3373   222
             Stealth RT TT   3803   300

 Okay Ill take their word for it

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 510 messages It
really angers me that you insisted you were right and that you had
no clue what your own car weighed Why didnt you check when I first
told you that your figures were implausible





 I am giving every chance to retract figures widely known The Mustang is
 rated at 205  222205 is 17 You have a 17hp advantage over a Mustang

 Seems that the 1993 Mustang 50 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford
 changed its testing procedures  Under the older procedures it still 
 rates closer to 225 hp  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more
 
Id like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that 
conclusion from the above data


 Big threat You are KOd by a Civic acording to CD 

 Yeah sure in your wet dreams  And thats probably where you got 
No sorry your wrong again You quoted the del Sol as doing 060 in
81 according to CD Interestingly the Stealth ES which is
faster than your RT does the samerun in 85 seconds according to
CD Kind of embarassing isnt it Why didnt you check the figures

before posting It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out
twice with your own figures

 that 112 second 060 for the Stealth


 Ill check CDs 591 issue  Strange that you claim to have that 

You really should have checked


 Go ahead and check asshole youll realize what an idiot you are for not
 checking data beforeposting Car Drive may 91 Stealth ES 222hp
 automatic

 For 3 posts now youve been harping on this May 1991 issue of Car  Driver
      2
 without posting any numbers  Why not  Because they prove me right and you
 aint got the guts to admit it  Yeah thought so

If you insist I gave you every chance to retract but

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 85164  Wonder why you couldnt find it

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra CD will run a 167 that a Sentra SER or Saturn
will run in the 15s Dont you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten 

A Mustang 50 which weights about the same according to your numbers
has less power and is much quicker Care to explain Dont be abusive
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to its a mystery to me

 The Sentra SER really is alot quicker than the 222hp FWD Sports car
 You are close to the 9k sentrae Go look up the numbers in CD  and
 report please

 No Im going to play your game 


       No way Sentras are SLOW  I took a test drive and it took
       217 to go 050  Why even the Hyundai Excel blows it doors

I guess you drove a 5 speed and couldnt shift
