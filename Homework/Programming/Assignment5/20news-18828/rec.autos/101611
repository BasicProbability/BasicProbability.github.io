Subject Re Difference between Lexus 300 series

From article 1993Apr520004823421ucsuColoradoEDU by lorenzorintintinColoradoEDU Eric Lorenzo
 	What is the difference between the LS300 ES300 and GS300  Seems
 Lexus cant stop popping out new models

Let me put it like this  The only similarity between the three models
  is the 300 or 3liter engine displacement  Actually the SC300 the
  coupe and the GS300 the funkylooking new sedan share the same 30
  liter inlinesix and the ES300 popular small sedan uses 30 V6 shared
  with the Camry  The SC300 is a luxurysports coupe the GS300 is the new
  luxury sedan and the ES300 is the base executive sedan  All three look
  completely different
