  The nice thing about REAL platinum plugs is that you dont have to change
them very often at all  I think like 50000 miles  They might cost 10
each but they would save for themselves in the long run

My TBird SCs manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60000mi
WalMart has Autolite platinum plugs for 200 each Are these real
platinum plugs I had Bosch platinums in my 80 Fiesta and my dad
had em in his 84 Bronconote the keyword had They didnt last
very long much less than 50000mi before they had to be replaced
I agree that they werent the greatest
