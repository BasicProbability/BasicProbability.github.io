Well Sweden and Australia and lord knows wherever else used to drive on
Australians still do drive on the wrong side of the road I believe
Sweden changed in 1968 The way I heard it was that they swapped
all the traffic signs around one Sunday

the wrong side of the road so the export market might have been
larger then than just the UK
