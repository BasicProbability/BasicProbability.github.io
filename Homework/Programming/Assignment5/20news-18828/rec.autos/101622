Why dont you look again at Motor Trends slalom times they are 679 right
along with the Integra and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all weather XGTV4 not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta

	My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires  I took
out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow not ice before I learned
this fact  I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately allweather
A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different 
rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing  
Said hed only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
Texas and not Colorado

Thanks
Eric
