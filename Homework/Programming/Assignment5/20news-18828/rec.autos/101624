I cant imagine any Civic or Saturn owners flexn there egos in stop light
races It generates as much excitement as two nerds challenging each other
in a game of oneonone basketball

The SL2 does 060 in about 85 note that this is closer to a 968 than
to a Paseo or Storm pseudosporty cars Thats a ridiculous
comparison I know but the point is that Saturns and highend Civics
for that matter accelerate just fine in fact better than most
unimproved muscle cars of the 60s 300 hp is great but tied to 2
tons it just doesnt go that quick Saturns on the other hand use 125
hp tied to 2400 lbs with some short gearing to move very quickly off the
line Anyway




While your 060 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports I saw
the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5speed SL2 at 79 seconds  Im sure that most
SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed but 79 seconds is still
astonishingly fast for a small 4door  A new Civic EX runs about 82 seconds
060 if Im not mistaken  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
9second range
