  BTW somebody stole the front grille off my beatup 1983 Nissan Sentra
  a few weeks ago  I couldnt believe it  Im just driving around
  without it now
 
 Years ago my brother lived in a ROUGH area  he left his NOVA 
 parked on the street in FRONT of his house for a few days  
 one day he went to move it back into the driveway it wouldnt start
 
 Seems some industrious fool needed a NOVA GAS TANK the fool found
 one under my brothers car  
 
 
 The engines in VW Beatles are quite easy to remove without entering the car
 or even opening the engine compartment How would you like to find that
 your car wouldnt start because the engine was stolen
 

I would probobly feel a hell of a lot poorer   a gas tank is about
50 in a junkyard   An engine more

Seriously though my other brother DARRELL left his VW on the same
street  someone stole the radiator out of it  try finding a VW
radiator in a junkyard      I DARE YOU
