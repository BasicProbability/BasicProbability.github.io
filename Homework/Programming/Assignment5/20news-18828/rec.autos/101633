Cup holders driving is an importantant enough undertaking

This is a good idea  so you can carry your nonalcoholic drinks without
spilling or having someone hold on to them

I agree  Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me
thirsty especially for something with caffeine  I consider it a
failing of my car that it has no cup holder nor anywhere to put a cup
holder
