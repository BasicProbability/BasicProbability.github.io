 Q  What is Ka band radar  Where is it used  Should a radar detector be
     able to handle it 
 
 A  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
     in socalled photoradar installations  In these installations a
     lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the
     direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit
     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle  Because of the low
     power and the 45 degree angle many people believe that a radar
     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit
     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
     capability anyway  The number of locales where photoradar is in use
     is limited and some question the legality of such units  Best advice
     learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they
     are used or else dont speed

Photo radar and mailed tickets make no sense at all Speeding is a moving 
violation committed by the operator not the owner The owner may be a 
rental agency a dealer a private party or a government agency As long
as the owner has no reason to expect the operator will be driving illegally
or unsafely the owner cannot be held responsible for what the operator does
The car may even have been driven without the owners knowledge or consent 
I cant believe a mailed ticket where the driver is not identified would 
stand up in court This is obviously a lazy cynical boneheaded fascist 
way to extort revenue and has nothing to do with public safety

We had those fg photoradar things here in Sweden a while ago
There was a lot of fuzz about them and a lot of sabotage too a spraycan
with touchup paint can do a lot of good

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of courtcases
where the owner of the car could prove he didnt drive it at the time
of speeding

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a carthief that
had stolen a car and made false plates He ofcourse chose a license number
of a identical car so the photo seemed correct

In conclosion Photoradar sucks every way you look at it
