Subject Clifford Delta car alarm


  Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm 450 installed  
Comes with glass break sensor motion detector and shock detector  Does 
anyone have one of these alarms  Are they any good  From the looks of it its
about the best on the market for the price  Its also on sale so thats 
another reason to get it  I think Ill be saving almost 200  Any opinions
