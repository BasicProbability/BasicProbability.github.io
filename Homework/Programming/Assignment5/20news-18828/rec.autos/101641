In your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning
will do much more good than just using detergent gas   While I
agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged
do they get and is 59 a good price or can I do it myself by buying
a can of  what and doing  what


A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner
and sending you on your merry way 59 poorer  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for 129
 
Just because you dealer sez you need it dont mean its necessarily so
Be suspicious
