In article 93096101507RSM2psuvmpsuedu RSM2psuvmpsuedu writes
MercedesBenz announced yesterday its plans to begin building sportutility
vehicles in the US by 1997  They are targeted at the Jeep Grand Cherokee
et al and will reportedly sell for less than 30000

Did anyone see a picture   Is it the Gwagon Gelaendewagen currently


There is a picture in the May 1993 edition of European Car although
it may not be on the shelf yet

Some things that the article says

	 prototype has front wheel drive first front drive
	  for Mercedes since the beginning of WWII

	 wheelbase 315m
	 7 seater
	 they claim that the price will be about the same as a
	  Renault Espace or Chrysler Voyager DM 50000

Looking at the picture slightly disguised it looks like the Ford
Aerostar to me

available in Europe and in the US by greymarket or is it an entirely new
vehicle  Any details would be appreciated

            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
            that you probably wouldnt understand anyway
