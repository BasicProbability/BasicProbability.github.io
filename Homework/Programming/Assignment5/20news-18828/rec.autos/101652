In your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning
will do much more good than just using detergent gas   While I
 
 A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than
 them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner
 and sending you on your merry way 59 poorer  Go to KMart and buy the
 cleaner yourself for 129

This should not be the case if they are at all reputable Fuel injector 
cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is
hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure The car is actually run on
the solvent during the cleaning process The equipment to properly do this is
pricey and generally not something the average home mechanic has The solvent
itself is not very expensive 58 and you could probably make up a hose to
fit your system and do it yourself but I didnt tell you that 

Not many intank cleaners are worth wasting your money on There has been a 
discussion of these products on here from time to time and Chevron Techron
not ProGard with Techron is generally regarded as the best It is however
a bit more than 129 a bottle IMHO it will not substitute for proper
injector cleaning if they are really crudded up Youll have to decide if the
59 price is a better deal than spending your time andor buying equipment to
do it
