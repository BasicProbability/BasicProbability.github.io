 JJ   I am considering buying a used 90 Taurus SHO  The car in 
 JJ question has 37k miles I took it for a test drive the other day
 JJ and a few questions came up
 JJ 
 JJ   
 JJ   Second is there anything I should specifically look for in an 
 JJ SHO of this vintage Anything I should specifically ask abt  
 JJ Brakes cluthch etc  I noticed on the drive the clutch engagemen
 JJ point seemed a little high since all my other cars are autotragics
 JJ Im not sure abt this point I had my foot firmly planted on the
 JJ brake when I started it up There was a bit of a pop in the pedal
 JJ soon after the engine started This also occured on a few Tbird SC
 JJ I test drove Was this the ABS self test
 
Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things  There has been a clutch 
replacement program you might check to see if the car is still eligible 
as it is a change well worth making  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter also a change worth making but thatll 
cost you some 

My brakes usually do one wibblewobble on startup so that is probably 
normal  Didnt know they had a selftest thats interesting

What kind of tires does the car have on it


  WinQwk 20b131  For a good time dial 7000 on your SHO
