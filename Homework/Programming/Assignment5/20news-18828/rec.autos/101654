My 66 Ford has vent windows operated by a crank just like a window 
only it opened out like a normal vent window My 70 F100 my
dads 84 Bronco and pretty much every truck Ive seen thats 
worth riding in has vent windows

Does that mean that Im not a young feller anymore

I dont understand the fascination with vent windows They create a tremendous 
turbulence and noise that makes even a simple connversation impossible at 
speeds above 40mph The current flowthrouh ventilation if designed right 
are far more superior
