HELP my car insurance has been cancelled for the second time in a row
I still havent gotten in touch with my agent from AAA because shes
out for the week but my mom said that I got a call saying that my insurance
was going to be cancelled because of an accident  not even a fenderbender 
that was never declared or anything Besides the fact that i have no idea how they found out about this the only
other thing that could bug them is that I have 1 ticket but I told them
about it and they said that it wasnt a problem
If I go to another insurance I know I will end up paying more bc I already
shopped around for this one and I cant afford to pay for the insurance
especially since I still havent gotten the 3000 the two insuance companies
are supposed to refund me I just got a new Saturn SL2 and cant afford the
car payments and the insurance but I bought the car having gotten a QUOTE
from State Farm which they later went back on 
PLEASE HELP ME what legal rights do I have Can I make State Farm who originally 
gave me the quote give me that rate they made a mistake after I signed all
the papers I did not give any false evidence How can I get my money back
for the car if I cant pay for the insurance Im deperate

	I just went through this mess in New Jersey Im still waiting for a
refund as well namely that the original company made a mistake and left me
in the lurch  My recourse was through NJs insurance dept Office of Consumer
Protection  You should have a similar office in your state  Make use of it

Good luck
