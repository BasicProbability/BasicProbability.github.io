Subject Re LH car order delay



	I read an article in the 325 Chicago Tribune stating that
	Chrysler is having problems addressing the demand for the 35L
	engine for its LH cars  Can anyone post how long they are
	waiting for an ordered car or how long they have been told
	theyll have to wait

Ordered mine December 30 got it nine weeks later  But the dealer said
that new orders were being held up  he didnt expect to see any
more 35Lengine LHs for awhile
