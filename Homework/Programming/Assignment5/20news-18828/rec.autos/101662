Subject Illegal tint windows

I know its a long shot but maybe someone went through this and will have
some comments to share

The story is this I bought a car out of state and Im trying to get
the safety inspection in Pennsylvania The problem is that the car has 
aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield The tint is rather
weak and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint

The inspection garage said that they wont pass it unless I get a
waiver from the state police So I went to the state police  the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal and I can get a
waiver only for a pre84 car or for a medical reason I asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says its illegal  He
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you cant have tint if
you cant see the inside of the car because of the tint When I told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well he shut the book
and said Its just illegal and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now Well wont argue with that

Since the vehicle code says its OK as long as you can see through the
tint Id like to keep it Ill reread the vehicle code in the
library  Id also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says its OK so I can get the inspection and so that I wont
get in trouble for the tint later on I also wouldnt mind registering
a complaint against that officer  he really pissed me off

So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police especially in Pennsylvania Does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer I called the station 
later on today but they basically said there is no place where I
could register a complaint against an officer And if I do decide
to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway how much of a chance do
I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court

Any comments about it will be welcome
