  Here are another ten reasons why we should all love CR
  10 Car salesmen love their new car buying service
  2 And later on buying a CR idealized family sedan
 
 And my number 1
 
 1 The spectacle of the religious fervour of the CR true believers
 
 Or the spectacle of Macho Real Men who would never bother to read the
 magazine but are more than apt to criticize it

Hey Im a Macho Real Man and I DO read it  So I can criticize
it all I want especially since I pay for the publication They
accept no outside advertising dont you know

 To you Baldrick the Renaissance was just          
 something that happened to other people            
 wasnt it  The Black Adder                 

Relying on Consumer Reports to pick your automobiles is like
letting Field  Stream select your living room furniture

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they
buy I dont care what magazine Btw I subscribe to three other 
auto rags I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men
from hell who think real men should read    

Statements like what you said above have no meaning People keep on
saying CU is only good for dishwashing detergent or as you
saidRelying on Consumer Reports     is like    and that is
all they say 

If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there
would be some real content
