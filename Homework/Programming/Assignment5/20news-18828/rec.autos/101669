Subject Re Integra GSR


Quad 4 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsThe Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down You can rev that car all day everyday
and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else I speak
from expierence
Im not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine  AND while the Integra costs alot more it is a

a couple of things  blowing a hose doesnt speak of engine reliability and 
while it is true that quad4s have a problem with head gasket leaks that was
a design flaw in the gasket and has been corrected  also i know pontiac is
replacing head gaskets that leak for free for 6year60k miles  other than
that i have found my quad4 to be completely solid and the direct ignition 
system means no wiresrotorrotorcap to ever deal with  also hydrolic lifters
mean no valve adjustments ever  im not badmouthing the integra engine i just
think you are going overboard on slamming the quad4  you are quite correct
that the integra engine is quieter although i would not say smoother my
quad4 loves to rev especially at the highend  do you have any evidence
of blocks cracking on quad4s  i have not heard of this
