   Id like to get some feedback on a car with most bang for the buck in the
13000 to 16000 price range Im looking for a car with enough civility to be
driven every day or even on long trips but when I hit the gas I want to feel
some acceleration  Handling is important also as are reliability and pretty
low maintenance costs  A stylish appearance is nice but I dont want a car
that is all show and not much go  Even though many of the imports are fast I
dont really want a turbo and I never have cared for the song sung by a four
clyinder  Id prefer a v6 or v8 for the engine  If you have any suggestions
