In your experience how true is it that a fuel injector cleaning
will do much more good than just using detergent gas   While I
agree that a clogged fuel injector would darken my day how clogged
do they get and is 59 a good price or can I do it myself by buying
a can of  what and doing  what


A fuel injector cleaning at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner
and sending you on your merry way 59 poorer  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for 129

Personally i wouldnt use the 129 product from KMart I knew about
this previously but this past weekend on PBSs MotorWeek Pat Goss 
their resident tech type discussed these products and recommends
not using them ie the nonisopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors  And although the 
others ethyl based do clean injectors they also cause rubber 
components in the fuel system to deteriorate and they dont mix well
with water to help remove it from the fuel system

I use a product recommended by VW called 44K by BG Products Inc
It cost more about 1400 but it is supposed to do the job without
the potential harmful side effects and its results are supposed to 
last from 2k to 4k miles I have also used Chevrons Techtrolene sp

I cant say that i have noticed any difference using either since i 
only use these product as a preventative maintenance item

 
Just because you dealer sez you need it dont mean its necessarily so
Be suspicious

            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
            that you probably wouldnt understand anyway
