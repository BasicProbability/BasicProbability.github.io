If youre planning on making long drives the 20W50 is probably fine
esp in the summer in your 10W40 car  But if youre making short drives
stick to the 10W40

Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the
57 diesel  They traced a cause to the use of 10W40 oil  They would
not honor warranty work if 10W40 was used if my memory serves me
530 1030 or 20 50 was OKd though
