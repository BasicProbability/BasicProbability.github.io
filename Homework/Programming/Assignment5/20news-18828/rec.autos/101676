Subject Re Saturns Pricing Policy

In article 1993Apr5230808581csbrownedu cs012055csbrownedu HokChung Tsang writes
Moreover if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by 1000 
then their cars will be even better deals  Say if the price of a Saturn was
already 1000 below market average for the class of cars then after they
reduce the dealer profit it would be 2000 below market average  It will

1 Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY

2 Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive

but what is Saturns motivation here  theyre already selling every
car they make with multiple shifts in the plant  given this what
possible motivation could they have to lower prices

cheers
