ok how about this to argue about  why does the sl2 have a much lower base
price than the sc2  its over 1k cheaperi forget the exact amount
doesnt it cost more to have the extra doorswindowslocksmotors etc that 
are in the 4 door  perhaps it is just a marketing dealpeople want the
2door so they will pay the extra 12k

Ok heres what I understand

The SLSL1SL2SW1SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars

Honda Civic
Toyota Tercel SLSL1
Toyota Corolla SL1SL2
Nissan Sentra
Mazda 323Protoge
Subaru LoyaleImpreza
Isuzu Stylus
Geo Prizm
Ford Escort
Mercury Tracer
Mistubishi Mirage
PlymouthDodge Colt


Their core competition is the Civic Corolla and Sentra  Most of the other
models are in the same class but arent the first cars you would think of
I threw in the EscortTracer because it has a good amount of Japanese
technology and has similar reliability stats  I didnt include domestic small
cars such as the Cavalier Sunbird Shadow Sundance Tempo and Topaz since I
think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese
roots

The SC1SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars

Toyota Paseo
Honda Civic SiCivic Coupesdel Sol Si
Nissan NX1600NX2000
Mazda MX3
Isuzu Impulse
Geo Storm
Ford Escort GT


If you look at the prices of these cars theyre more expensive than theyre
4door counterparts  The is good reason for this  It is a more upscale and
trenddriven market  Even though many of these models are based on sedan
platforms their interior etc is good enough to warrant slightly higher
prices  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of

Tercel  Paseo
Sentra  NX1600NX2000
Civic  del Sol
323  MX3 not sure on this one
Stylus  ImpulseStorm

To illustrate a Tercel starts at around 8000 while the Paseo starts at
around 11000  Even a 4door Tercel will cost less than a 2door Paseo  Now
you might be saying that the Tercel doesnt offer the power that some 4doors
offer  What I mean is that there is no 4dr Tercel with a comparable
powerplant as its sport coupe derivative  Lets take another example the
Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XSStorm GSi  Both have the same powerplants a
16L 140hp engine but the smaller 2dr coupes are generally more expensive
Again this is because the twodoor sport coupe market is a more
fashionoriented and trendsetting segment  People are willing to pay more
money for this type of car  


In short even though the SC1SC2 may be smaller hence less car its market
orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent
sedan SL1SL2 version

I hope this clears things up a bit
