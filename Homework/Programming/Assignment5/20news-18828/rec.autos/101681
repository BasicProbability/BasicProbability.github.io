 85 Mph speedos  esp the electronic ones

 The digital dash of the 87 cougars with the large analog clock in
 the middle of the dash  everything was digital except the stinking clock

  The funny thing about the digital dash 87 Tbird with the 85mph speedo 
limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would 
read all the way up to 187kph  At this point the stock anemic 302 would get 
short of breath  This of course was equivalent to about 116mph heheI bet 
I really coulda confused this thing if Id toyed with the engine and rolled
the stupid thing the digits were limited to 199 

  Ive gotta agree with ya on the analog clock wdigital dash though  My
girlfriend had a 85 TurboCoupe with a digital clock and analog gaugesradio
Go figure

 I love the keyless entry on my TBird its great for those times that
 I had to stop to put air in my tires I could get out and lock the door
 with the engine running while I ran around to air up the tire It also

  I had a great feature on my Tbird  I could pull the key out and 
leave the ignition on  This scared the hell out of me the first time it
happened but I kinda grew to like it  Musta been a bad key copy or 
something
