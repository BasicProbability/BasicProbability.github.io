 So I block the wouldbe passers Not only for my own good  
      
 but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize it
    
 As a rule of philosophy I dont feel particularly sorry when somebody gets

Well if you want to stick the nose of your car up the ass of a 50 foot semi I
suppose its your neck however Im not going to let you kill me in the bargain
If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death due to less that
wise driving practices then TOUGH





Thank God for the Fourth of July for it yearly rids the earth of a considerable
load of fools
