	Do you think I can use a electric drill change to a suitable
bit  to turn it out  If I can succeed can I retighten it not too
tight is it safe without oil leak

Tighten the bolt to the specified torque in your service manual  That
way it wont leak strip break etc hopefully  

Thank you very much in advance  Winson

You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in
place of the bolt  I have one on both of my cars  There have been no
leaks in 210000 miles combined miles on both cars
