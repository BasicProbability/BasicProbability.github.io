 I looked into getting ac installed on my 1987 Honda CRX Si
 The unit is 875 plus shipping installation is like 5 12 hours on
 top of that  This is a hunk of change
 
 Does anyone know any place that does aftermarket ac installation
 not with a Honda ac unit but some third party unit
 
 I cannot seem to find anyone who can put a third party ac unit in a
 Honda  I am in No Carolina so I would prefer some place nearby but
 any references would be handy

 Thx Andy brandtcsuncedu

Sorry I cant help you with your question but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket AC units  I have a FrostKing or FrostTemp
forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier and am quite unhappy with
it  The fan is noisy and doesnt put out much air  I will never have
an aftermarket AC installed in any of my vehicles again  I just cant
trust the quality and performance after this experience
