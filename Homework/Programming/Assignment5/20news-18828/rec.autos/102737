Subject Re BRAINDEAD Drivers Who Dont Look Ahead


 I agree that if traffic is all blocked up and you want to pass you might
 not feel like moving over for someone behind you because you dont want to
 give them that one carlength when they should just wait like you are
 BUT if youre one of those people that just sits behind the person and
 doesnt flash them with the high beams or pull left and flash them or
 ride their bumper or otherwise tell them that you do in fact want to 
 go by and youre not just drafting them then get the hell out of the 
 way of someone who will  I especially hate it when you flash someone at
 the back of a line and they dont pass it on  
 And theres also the issue of some cars being more intimidating to get 
 people out of the way than others  For instance 8586 GTs look 
 pretty mean in a rearview mirror at night with the foglights on  
 There have been plenty of times when Ive broken up a pack that a 
 secondinline hyundai has been behind for miles  You just need to
 know how to get their attention


Id like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers If they see you
they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle
finger extended Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane
ahead
