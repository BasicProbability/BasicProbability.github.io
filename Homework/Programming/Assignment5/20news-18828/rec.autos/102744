Subject AfterMarket Cruise Controls Specific Questions
From MikeWCancbyuedu MD Mike Wieda

Howdy

Im a little new to this newsgroup but I would like to tap some of the
knowledge and expertise available here

The Subject  Aftermarket cruise controls

The Background
I recently broke my ankle in a roadbicycling accident 4 places five 
screws yuk    In two weeks I will be returning to Texas my
home from my school BYU in Provo Utah  As you can imagine trying to
drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome of
a good time  My car does not have a cruise control so I would have to do
all the pedalling ha ha with my messedup ankle

My question
What is the general opinion of aftermarket cruise control units  I
realize that a cheap CC cruise control from say Pep Boys isnt going to
be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a
thing  And I uderstand that I probably cant expect much in the way of
accuracy looks and that sort of thing  But anythings gotta be better than
trying to drive with a hosed ankle

I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee 4 speed standard 44 25L engine with
ketteringsp ignition yknow distributor cap rotor that setupnot
electronic  Maybe you couldve guessed it being an 84 but Im just trying
to give information as completly as I can

I found a CC unit for 80 bucks  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system 
instead of an electric servormotor  Is this good or bad  If I did buy
this CC which vacuum hose should I tap

It has two speed sensors  One magnetic and one that gets a signal from the 
negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pickup or so I
understand  I can use either one  Which is best  The manual says I read
it in the store today that the magneticaxle setup is more accurate but
harder to install  Is there really a big difference

It has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other CCs but does NOT have a
sensor for the clutch pedal  So if I wasnt paying real close attention I
might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up  Which
would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned 
the thing off  Im pretty coordinated so this doesnt bother me if it
were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but Im ok with it

The installation also calls for an attachment to a steadyon brake signal
and a switchedon brake signal  I think I can get a switched brake signal
from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse  Am I right  But Im
not sure where to get the steadyon brake signal or for that matter what
exactly it is  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get
it

I think I can figure the other things out  Like how to hookup the negative
side tachtype sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and
all that miscellaneous business  But I need a little help with

	1  Is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a
	    device
	2  Is there any particularly good aftermarket CC
	3  Are professionally installed CCs signifacantly better and
	    worth the cabbage
	4  If the unit I saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just
	    that it is at Pep Boy and its 80 is sufficient for my simple 
	    needs how do I get the thing installed properly specifically
	    the questions above

My father and I built a Veep Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ2A when I was in
high school so I consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and
cars  So the installation doesnt scare me  I just want to be certain that
I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more
complicated than my Veep 

I appreciate your time in reading my post and I would appreciate any
expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject  If you would like to share
some of your wisdom please email as I dont get over this group very often
but I check my mail all the time

Again thanks for any help anyone may have
