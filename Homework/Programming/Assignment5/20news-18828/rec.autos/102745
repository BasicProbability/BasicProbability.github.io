whips and their tempers Initially all cars were built with the drivers
controls on the right because thats the way people drove buggies so the

This is just not so  many of the earliest cars had their steering
controls in the center of the vehicle and there is no discernible
pattern of left or righthand steering controls until a few years into
the 20th century when in America at least lefthand wheels became the
pattern The mule team or horses I imagine explanation however

This coffee plunges into the stomachthe mind is aroused and
ideas pour forth like the battalions of the Grand Army on the field
of battle  Memories charge at full gallopthe light cavalry
of comparisons deploys itself magnificently the artillery of logic
hurry in with their train of ammunition flashes of wit pop up like
sharpshooters
