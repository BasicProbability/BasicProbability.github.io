      Consumers report did a study I think and found that most
trucks got worse mileage with the tailgate off The tailgates on the
newer trucks actually help

oh sure they do  and replacing the front bumper and grille with a closet
door helps mileage and cooling  if CR actually said that then they have
bigger fools working for them than the fools that believe their drivel  but
who am I to argue this  just someone thats been a pickupdriver for 20
years thats all  forget the net just take off the tailgate on hiway trips
since the nets arent designed to nor capable of restraining a load in the bed
anyway  around town the tailgate will have a negligable effect on mileage
anyway

They may help to improve mileage in some cases I believe With the tailgate
on the flow structure behind the cab may differ and the vortex drag may be
reduced during high speed driving

How about those toneau covers Ive been thinking of building one
from chipboard for roadtrips Any comment on how they affect
mileage in highway travel
