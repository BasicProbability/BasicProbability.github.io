I just started reading this thread today so forgive me if it has already been
mentioned  Butwhat was the deal with Renaults putting the horn on the
lefthand turnsignal stalk  It was a button on the end where the washer
button would be on the wiperwasher stalk  Could the Frenchies not figure
out the wiring through the steering wheel or what

  Well before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of
braindeads for this 
  My 1979 Mercury Capri had this lovely feature This was not the earlier
German variant but the newer one that was identical to the Mustang of 
current fame I cant tell you how many times this feature pissed me off
Come to think of it my brothers Zepher had this as well

Going back to an earlier thread imagine having to turn left shift gears
flash a stray driver in the intersection with your lefthand high beam on
the headlight stalk AND after the driver wouldnt move having to honk the
horn on the lefthand stalk  Gives me the heebiejeebies
