 While taking an extended Easter vacation I was going north on I45
 somewhere between Centerville TX and Dallas TX and I came upon a 
 train parked on a trestle with its locomotive sitting directly over
 the northbound lanes  There appeared to be movement within the cab 
 and out of curiosity I slowed to 85 to get a better look  Just as I
 passed from underneath the trestle my radar detector went into full 
 alert  all lights lit and all chirps beeps and buzzes going strong
 I thought I had been nailed good but no police materialized
 
 Could this have been caused by the trains radio or what
 


I dont know about trains but Ive saw a sign on the back of a
Greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off
It doesnt explain why but it does set off my radar detector
