 This reminds me of the first time my cousin did an oil change on his
car He crawled under removed a bolt drained the fluid replaced the
bolt then carefully poured in 5 quarts of oil Didnt bother to
check the dip stick just drove off Didnt get too far till me found
out that hed drained the 4speed trans and dumped an extra 5 quarts
into the engine MORAL As Craig said dont be ashamed to get some
in person help the first time
