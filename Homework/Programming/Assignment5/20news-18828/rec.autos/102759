You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in
place of the bolt  I have one on both of my cars  There have been no
leaks in 210000 miles combined miles on both cars

Yes but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot

all they have to do is reach underneath turn a valve and forget the trip 
home

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators and Ive never 
seen nor heard of a vandal opening one  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have 
to crawl furthur under the car to open it  

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods and do things
that dont get them dirty like keying your car dumping sand sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank TPing it etc
