Hi Im interested in getting the list for license plate numbers  If anyone
has a listing Id appreciate getting a copy of it  Thanks

You can go to the DMV and ask for their listing  Although I
dont know where you may actually buy a copy you can use theirs
for your perusal  In California the listing of personalized
license plates run 3 volumes each about 15 thick  I hope this
is what youre asking for


Ken
