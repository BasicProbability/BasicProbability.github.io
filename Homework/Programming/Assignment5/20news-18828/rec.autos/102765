Subject Re WARNINGplease read


Unfortunately Ive got another story to add to this  My girlfriend
and I were driving through west LA and got pelted by a rock just as
we were pulling away from a stoplight  The scary thing was that the
rock was heavy enough to put a decentsized dent in the door of my 72
Riviera which is pretty much solid Detriot Iron  Couple of inches
higher and it would have gone through the window
