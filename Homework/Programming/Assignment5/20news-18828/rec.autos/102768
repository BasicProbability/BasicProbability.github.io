There are a number of electronic mailing lists on the network devoted to
various special automotive topics

To the best of my knowledge all the lists appearing here have open
membership policies  It is my policy not to list closed mailing lists
here

Most mailing lists provide separate addresses for administrative
queries and for general mail where separate administrative
addresses exist I have listed those below as the general addresses
are not appropriate for inquirys and requests
