My TOP 10 list of dumbest automotive concepts ever

10 1984 Dodge Colt Vista  tachometer only avail with automatic trans
9 Backup lights on Corvette  theyre on the sides of the car
                          
Sure would be interested to know what years this was
I dont seem to recall ANY car with backup lights on the sides much
less any Corvette  I suppose I could be misinterpreting what you are
trying to say here

Just a quick comment Backup lights mounted on the side
would actually be extremely useful for people backing out of
parking stalls

separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time
