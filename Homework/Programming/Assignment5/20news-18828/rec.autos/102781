This is consistent with the pre74 911  The engine before that was a 22
litre or less depending on how early you go and got its power at high
revs starting slowly at about 3K and jumping up at around 5K with a 
narrow band  The 74 was a 3 litre and had a lot of smog equipment  If
you got much power at all itd be better distributed through the rev
range

Bzzzt  Wrong answer  It really depends on whether you are talking model
year or date of manufacture  For instance mine was a 67 but was
manufactured in August of 66  Prior to 1970 all 911s were 2o liter  For
the 70 and 71 model years they were 22 liter  for the 1972 and 1973
model years they were 24 liter EXCEPT for the 73 Carerra RS which was a
27 liter  The 74 and later years were easily identified by the new 5 mph
bumpers  Most models in the 74 year were 27 lietsr EXCEPT the Carerra
RSR which was a 30 liter US Carerras from 74 were 27 liter models  In
78 they went to 30 liter and there was only a single model the SC think
of it as a cross between the S and the Carerra models  note all the above
are based on MODEL year not date of manufacture  

I stand corrected  This is all from memory mind you  

As for the rev happy behavior the earlier cars are even more prone to
this  The 24 liter cars used low compression engines and suffered a bit
in this regard  The early 30 liter and 27 liter engines also got a good
dose of smog gear as well  The 20 and 22 liter engines were far and away
the quickest revvers of the lot 

Yeah thats what I was trying to say  No REALLY
