This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
in the head by one of the larger rocks  I dont recall if she 
made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
doctors werent holding out hope that shed live

What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
20 pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low

Society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams The basic reason
is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
No Big Deal Kids see hundreds on murderous acts on TV we can abort 
children on demand and kill the sick and old at will So why be surprised
when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people They dont care because the
message they hear is Life is Cheap
