My TOP 10 list of dumbest automotive concepts ever

10 1984 Dodge Colt Vista  tachometer only avail with automatic trans
9 Backup lights on Corvette  theyre on the sides of the car
                          
Sure would be interested to know what years this was
I dont seem to recall ANY car with backup lights on the sides much
less any Corvette  I suppose I could be misinterpreting what you are
trying to say here

Just a quick comment Backup lights mounted on the side
would actually be extremely useful for people backing out of
parking stalls

Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of
separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time
struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing
gourd Unknown netperson

	Wasnt the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he
could see where he was backing up  Although reverse lights on the sides
are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
path of the car I dont think warnings were their original intents since they
are colored white
