Subject Re Thinking About Buying Intrepid  Good or Bad Idea


I bought an Intrepid about two months ago and am very happy with
it  Lots of room inside and even with the smaller engine it has
enough power for me  The only problem I found was a small
selection on the dealers lots They are hot sellers around here
