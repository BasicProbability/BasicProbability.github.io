Subject Re Plymouth SundanceDodge Shadow experiences


I dont know if some lemons are out there but from personal experience
My brothers has been trouble free  Not one single repair only 
regular maintainance  The only work he had done on it was a result
of his stupidity he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn 
on a busy intersection and was rearended  He has a 1989 Plymouth
Sundance  I would recomend it but I would also like to say that if
you can wait about six months ChryCo is coming out with a new car
called the Neon that is built in the same way as the LHs where
Good luck with your desiscion
