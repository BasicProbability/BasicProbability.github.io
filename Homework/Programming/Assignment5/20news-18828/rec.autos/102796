Im wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter Ive been
doing it my self over 200000 miles on my current toyota truck Ive got
over 150k Ive heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
transmission My experiences suggest otherwise What techniques do you use

	Yeah  I dont use the clutch all the time either  Ive done it
with Fords BMW Datsun and Chevy and it works fine  I cant think of
any reason that it would damage the tranny  Essentially you are just
doing what the synchros do anyhow  match the engine speed with the
tranny speed and slip it into gear


On some old pieces of junk I drove the transmission was so
worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless
To date Ive driven rabbits datsuns comets fords  a chevy Some where
harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
quicker  easier they where to shift

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever If for some reason I miss the shift window
I lightly press the accelerator  try agian Ive found that clutchless
shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 40007000 I also skip gears some
times using 135 1245 

	Sounds about right  I usually slip it out during throttledown
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
usually about a second and then slip it into gear
