An audible alarm is just an annoyance  to either a professional or
amateur  NOBODY LISTENS TO AUDIBLE ALARMS ANYMORE  The thieves know

This is why I think there ought to be a heavy fine on false alarms
Im really honked off about the fact that due to all the
cars with cruddy alarms crying wolf no one will pay any attention
to my car if its alarm ever goes off for real

 Depends on your area in the city nobody thinks about itbut at a mall or
something near the suburbs people do at least glance over  Remember an
alarm is only a deterent not a prevention  If a thief sees two cars he
likes one has an alarm and the other doesnt hes obviously going to skip
the alarmed car and avoid the hassle  There is a way around every alarm but
at least youve got SOMETHING on your side
