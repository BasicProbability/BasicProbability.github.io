This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
in the head by one of the larger rocks  I dont recall if she 
made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
doctors werent holding out hope that shed live

What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
20 pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low

   Yes Nobody is watching them  If they get caught there is no punishment
 at all  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping
 with a goodsized belt and then taken into some hospital to see first hand
 what kind of damage such accidents cause   Of course this doesnt happen
 any more  That whipping would probably save the kids life by teaching
 him some respect for others  A person with that little respect would
 inevitably wind up dead early anyway

   The problem is creeping gradualism  If you put a frog into hot water
 he just jumps out  But if you put him into cold water and then everso
 gradually heat it the frog will cook  This is what the entertainment
 industry and lack of religious moral and educational standards in our
 modern North American society have done to us over the years  Now that
 we are about to be cooked we may have woken up too late

Society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams The basic reason
is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
No Big Deal Kids see hundreds on murderous acts on TV we can abort 
children on demand and kill the sick and old at will So why be surprised
when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people They dont care because the
message they hear is Life is Cheap

  And the education system and the Religious Leaders arent doing much 
 about it either  With both parents working in this society where is
 the stabilizing influence at home   Latchkey children are everywhere
 And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to
 whatever violent hatepromoting music and videos they like because no
 one is home to stop it

  This day and age when there is about 100 times more things to learn
 than when I went to school our answer to this increased knowledge is
 shorter school hours and more leisure time  I say keep the kids in
 school longer feed them good food and teach them something and when
 they get home have a parent there to interact and monitor them  There
 is a very old and now forgotten proverb a child left on his own will
 bring a parent to grief  Daycare systems are not the answer  This is
 just shifting the parents own responsibilities off on someone else to
 whom its not a lifelong committment but rather just a job
