sorry for the 0 auto content but  
 
 That is why lowabiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves
 and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is 
 imminent

You do have the power Steve You can do it Why dont you Why dont you
go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars Make sure you do a good
job though  dont miss  cause like they have big rocks  and take it from
me  those kids are mean

  This last comment was obviously a bit cynical but a true statement of
 the attitude of some drivers theres your autos content I would say

  What lawabiding not lowabiding as above talk about Freudian slips
 citizens have the right and responsibility to do is try to PREVENT this
 type of behaviour in children  A doctor may have to use deadly force
 against a part of a body like amputating it when an infectiondisease
 has gone too far  But his real desire would have been to prevent the
 disease in the first place or at least nip it in the bud

   Followups should go to altparentsteens
