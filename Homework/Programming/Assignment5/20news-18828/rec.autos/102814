Subject Re Impala SS going into production

 From the latest issue of AutoWeek the Chevy Impala SS will arrive in
 dealer showrooms in mid1994  Dealers have already been notified  No word
 on the changes to be made for the production version  My question to all of
 you is would you buy it  And how much would you pay for it

Alright GM Finally my wishes have come true Moby Dick with a Corvette
engine  DOnt you think they should maybe spend the money doing something
about the lousy buildqualitydesign of their bigger selling cars  This is
another example of why GM is in so much trouble  If youre going to stick
the LT1 or ZR1 engine in a car at least make it a nice looking one
Sheesh
