Subject Improvements in Automatic Transmissions


The biggest hurdle for automatics IMHO is not shifting speed
per se but rather the transmissions reaction speed when you
try to force it to shift manually  

This was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT  it took SOOOOOO
LONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio

The sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an
electronicallyshifted manual  Might this mean that Saturn has
conquered the problem  I dunno only driven Saturn 5speeds

INPUT PLEASE

Another question  Any plans for a manualtrans Chrysler LH
Does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo
