I just started reading this thread today so forgive me if it has already been
mentioned  Butwhat was the deal with Renaults putting the horn on the
lefthand turnsignal stalk  It was a button on the end where the washer
button would be on the wiperwasher stalk  Could the Frenchies not figure
out the wiring through the steering wheel or what

Ford tried that also back in 1983  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at
the end of the turnsignal stalk instead of in the center of the wheel where
God intended it to be   I drove two different cars then the other an
1984 Camry and never did get used to pushing the turnsignal stalk to
blow the horn  The only time I got it right was when I was getting the
annual staterequired safety inspection
Not one of Fords better ideas
