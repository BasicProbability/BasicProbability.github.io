 	Actually you want a Checker Special if you can find one

 	Good luck  Im sorry I let mine go

I grew up in New York City so I rode in many Checker cabs  The jump
seats were fun as a kid  Although the cars were roomy  a good trait
for a taxi  they had a design flaw that I dont understand they never
fixed the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the
driver braked  I wouldnt want to take a long ride in the back seat of
one of these vehicles  Why did you like yours  I never drove one so
I have to ask
