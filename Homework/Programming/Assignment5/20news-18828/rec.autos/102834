The idea here is to list pointless options You know stuff you
get on a car that has no earthly use


1 Power windows

I like my power windows I think theyre worth it

However cruise control is a pretty dumb option Whats the point
If youre on a long trip you floor the gas and keep your eyes on
the rearview mirror for cops right

Power seats are pretty dumb too unless youre unlucky enough to have
to share your car Otherwise youd just adjust it once and just leave
it like that
