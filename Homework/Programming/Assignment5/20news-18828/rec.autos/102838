Subject Re Manual Shift Bigots

In recautos you write

if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission
it cant be half bad  

This McLaren autotransmission I still think its only half auto
but You may be right has NOTHING to do with Your GM Chrysler Volvo
or whatever auto transmission Its a normal manual transmission
gearbox with clutch and all but there are servo motors which do
the shifting 

That means there is no power loss in the drivetrain if You take out 
minimal mechanical friction and the samiauto transmissions 
Ferrari Williams McLaren dont tell You when to shift
either However these transmissions share an important disadvantage
with Your stock autotrannie They are EXPENSIVE

As long as these servoshifted gearboxes arent available on 
normal cars Im gonna stick with my manual I just cant see an
advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the
loss in mileage and power except maybe in real heavy traffic But
then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway

Theres no point in making a religion out of this I just wanted to
point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion so theres
no need for a flame war

eliot

Have a safe ride

Chris
