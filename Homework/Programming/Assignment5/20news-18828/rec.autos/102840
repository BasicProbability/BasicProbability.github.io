My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever If for some reason I miss the shift window
I lightly press the accelerator  try agian Ive found that clutchless
shifting is eaiserquicker at high rpms 40007000 I also skip gears some
times using 135 1245

        Sounds about right  I usually slip it out during throttledown
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
usually about a second and then slip it into gear
 
   So how did you guys learn this Is it something you were
born with or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few
times how many times
 
   I would think youd have to have a certain amount of feel
for it to begin with Some people would never get it and others
like me would never have the guts to try it unless maybe you
were planning to buy a new transmission anyway
 
   BTW Ive heard that quite a few truckers and race car
drivers shift this way
