Hey NISSAN why arent you guys making any station wagons  You used
to make a wagon on every platform SENTRA STANZA MAXIMA and now
NONE AT ALL

In fact they make some but they just dont sell them here in US

Sunny California is a 16l wagon based on Sentra
Avenil is a 20l 4WD2WD wagon It looks like Infinity G20 
but actually its independently designed to be a wagonI mean its 
not based on any sedans 
 
Nissan had better consider to sell them here

After buying my SER and really loving it I would like to buy another
NISSAN product for my wife  but prefer a wagon  Ive owned minivans
and dont prefer them

How about an ALTIMA wagon  or a sentra wagon would do

Sounds nice But I doubt they have a plan Coz Avenil was introduced 
to replace any sedan based wagon

or heres an even better suggestion why dont you guys go ahead and
buy the rest of Fuji Heavy Industries Subaru and put either an
inline 4 or V6 into the LEGACY 4WD wagon  Id buy the Legacy in a
minute if it had a Nissan engine instead of the Horizontal 4 that they
seem sentimentally attached to

With all the Camry Accord Taurus Volvo and Subaru wagons out there
 its got to be a market segment that would be worthwhile

I can wait a year or two  but if you dont have something to compete
by the 1995 model I may have to go elsewhere

Thanks
