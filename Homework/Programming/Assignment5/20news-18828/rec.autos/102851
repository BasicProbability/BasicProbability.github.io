I take the electrodes of the AmpOhmVolt meter whatever and connect one
to each earlobe  Then symmetrically insert my fingers in each of the
spark plug boots No cheating guys  both hands must be used

I have just a couple of questions about this technique

First what firing order should I use  Do I start with my pointer
finger or my pinky  Left hand or right

And secondly I have a 12cyl and there are two cylinders unaccounted
for  Any suggestions
