Subject Cleaning EuroWiper Boots

I have the EuroWiper boots in White and had to throw away the first pair
since I found no way of cleaning them after they looked almost black Now
I have my second pair of white ones and once again they are dirty I need
a way to clean them wo removing them since I had to cut them to remove
them is there a way Or should I just buy black ones 
thanks
Joel

Its not a blackwhite thing its a homosapian thing
It takes a big man to cry and an even bigger man to laugh at that man
