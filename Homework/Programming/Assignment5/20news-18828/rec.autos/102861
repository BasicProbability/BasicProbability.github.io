Compare either to the Porsche 911 and you tell me which was designed

	Oh right  Only 120000 dollar cars should be driven fast
They drive goddamn Rabbits at 120 MPH in Europe pal and I reckon
a Taurus is at least as capable as a Rabbit

My whole point was not to say that the cars couldnt go that fast
but that they shouldnt go that fast  A family sedan designed to be
operable at 85mph doesnt suddenly become operable at 130mph because
you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires and a much
larger engine  Thats what the SHO is  a slightly modified family
sedan with a powerful engine  They didnt even bother improving the
brakes

The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO  a big power
plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications
I have reallife experience with the Mustang  it handles like a
brick except when youre invoking oversteer of course something I
personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is
inadequate even from 80mph  Lots of accelleration  but the rest of
the car is not up to par

I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in
mind  It didnt have to be the 911  it could have been the much
cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models  All of these
cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them
drivable at high speed  This should be elementary

There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought
it up  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but I believe
the following to be true

1 Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here
2 The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
   they are here and usually include animal fences  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways
3 Not all of Europe is the Autobahn  Most places in Europe have
   speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in
   the US  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not
   much higher than 120kmh

I strongly suspect you wont find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph
nearly 200kmh on the Autobahn but I could be wrong  Some people
have no respect for their own lives

You certainly havent convinced me

	Of course not  Speedingisbad  Speedingisillegal 
Iwillnotspeed  IloveBigBrother  You had your mind made up
already

If you think so you sure dont pay attention to my postings
