Subject Re Ranger vs S10 opinions

If your buying a compact pickup do yourself a favor and wait a few months
for the 1994 GMC sonoma  Magazines are saying it is day and night over the
current truck  Its georgeous solid and fast 200hp Vortec 43 V6
Should whip the Ranger in every area too accept maybe payload  And always
pick a GMC over a Chevy  GMCs are always so much better looking  Man I 
miss the Comanche

Its a feeling that we all wanna know
and its an obsession to some
to keep the world in you rearview mirror
while you try to run down the sun
