 Hello
 
 	Does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine
 compartment  Should I turn clockwise or counter  I tried any kind
 of lubricants WD40etc but I still failed
 	Do you think I can use a electric drill change to a suitable
 bit  to turn it out  If I can succeed can I retighten it not too
 tight is it safe without oil leak
 Thank you very much in advance  Winson

  I would suggest you take the car to the nearest Chevron dealer with
your own oil and filter  Ask for an oil change  It will cost less
than 10  Watch himher do it  Just from watching someone do a job
you will be able to learn and remember the sequence and do it right
when you do it yourself the next time  Besides when heshe loosens
the drain nut the next time around it will be easier for you

  If it is stuck use an impact wrench  Not too much force though
Use a new washer each time you put the nut back
