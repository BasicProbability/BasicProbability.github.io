You could take a screw driver and hammer and start punching holes in
various locations and when some black slippery stuff starts pouring
out then you would know that the oil drain plug is nearby within a foot
or two anyway Close the holes with toilet paper before refileing with oil
though

You have to refill the engine with oil Wow no wonder I cant get
an engine to last more than my first oil change Dont forget to
punch holes in the radiator too it will spray nice refreshing water
                    
on the engine and keep it nice  cool

Gee you really make me confused  What is radiator  Where is it located
What does it look like  Will it release any radiation since it sounds 
like radiation generator when you punch holes
