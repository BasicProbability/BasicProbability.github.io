Subject Re LH Workmanship

I just visited the NY Auto Show and saw two LH cars on the floor Eagle 
Vision and Dodge Intrepid 

Really nice I must say Very attractive styling lots of features and room 
at a competitive price  

Unfortunately the workmanship is quite disappointing On BOTH cars
the rubber seals around the window and door fell off It turns out
the seals are just big grooved rubber band It goes on just by pressing
the groove against the tongue on the door frame Surely it would come
off easily

Lack of build quality was the thing  I notced on the first 2 LHs I
saw months back The panel gaps were large and nonuniform between
the 2 cars I saw  the kind of thing you expect and accept on a
Mustang  but not from Chryslers savior  I drove one of the low
end cars and thought it was more than adequate Id prefer
an LH to a Taurus from my brief experience

I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineeringassembly
problems that will show up later

I may still consider buying it but only when it establishes a good
track record
