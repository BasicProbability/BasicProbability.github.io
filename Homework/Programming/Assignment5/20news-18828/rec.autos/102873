Driving 130 in a straight line is fine you very soon become aclimated 
to it Its only a rush when there are corners that you dont
think you can make

On a clear autobahn 130 is nothing In the US 99 of people and
all judges would label you insane and it is difficult to persuade
people otherwise

Sure but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface
isnt much different to a typical TX freeway They are better
in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc Id have
no problem driving 130 on most US freeways as it is I save it
for the backroads which really are more likely to be dangerous

than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130 Dont get me wrong I love to

It would have to be quite severe I dont recall any US freeway
without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent well damped car Note that my definition
of decent well damped would exclude most typical American sedans

drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130 but thats 30 more
than Ive ever tried in it cause there isnt a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts

I dont know where you live but I would be much more worried
about cops other traffic etc than the road surface at 130
It just isnt that fast or that dangerous If you have a Probe
GT no problem The 4cyl models I have driven would be
likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds
