	Wasnt the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he
could see where he was backing up  Although reverse lights on the sides

No reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up They
arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail
lights 

are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
path of the car I dont think warnings were their original intents since they
are colored white

Well red and orange were already taken Maybe white defines the direction
that the car is moving in


If you really want to be able to see behind you get some fog lamps for
the back of the car These work very well  and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone
