I deleted your name because I dont want to sound accusative in my remark
 
 This is a twosided problem Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time
 The breeding of these lowlifes is getting worse our justice system is at best
 extremely weak to handle these problems That is why lowabiding citizens should have
 the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary 
 anywhere a threat is imminent
 
 My Camaro my pride and joy got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back
 The persons that did that were eventually caught lucky for me but not before
 having trashed the car
 
 On another occasion on my way from Texas to Florida I had stopped in a small motel
 for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida About 5 youths were disturbing my
 car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out When I and another tenant
 walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively they vanished 
 Needless to say I immediately packedup and left
 
 Watch out for carjacking and staged accidents They can be deadly
 
Im not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if 
you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
alarm  I can think of worse things in the world  Glad you got out of there
before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun

We can all ask whats happening to society these days but dont forget to
ask another important question too What effort am I expending to make it any
different than it is

Just my thoughts
