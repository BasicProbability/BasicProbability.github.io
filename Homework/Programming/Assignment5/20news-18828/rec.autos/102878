It shouldnt be THAT hard if you know much about digital electronics  If the
counter is made with standard TTL chips all you should need to do is find
the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in
and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh youd also have
to know what the conventions are for low and high  It might be a little more
involved than this but it shouldnt be beyond someone with a BSEE or BS EET
All the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using
a translation table stored in ROM


Nobody is using discrete ICs to do these functions anymore if at
all  I doubt any of the Motor electronics had any to start with
Much less TTL

I can almost guarantee that itll a fruitless attempt to figure out
how BMW does it without breaking anything and invalidating any
warranty  on the car  If youre lucky youd still be able to
start the car
