This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
in the head by one of the larger rocks  I dont recall if she 
made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
doctors werent holding out hope that shed live

	The girls OK actually and she recovered well enough to go home  I
dont know if she has any permanent damage though  Just in case anybody was
concerned


What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
20 pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low

Erik velapold

	If people start forcing others to take responsibility for their actions
things like this wouldnt happen  Untill we stop blaming outside causes and
start blaming the criminals we will continue to let things like this happen
