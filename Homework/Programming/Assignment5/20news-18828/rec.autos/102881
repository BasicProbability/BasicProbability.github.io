sorry for the 0 auto content but  

 That is why lowabiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves
 and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is 
 imminent

You do have the power Steve You can do it Why dont you Why dont you
go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars Make sure you do a good
job though  dont miss  cause like they have big rocks  and take it from
me  those kids are mean

	As a stong selfdefense advocate youre statement does littel
but irk me  Of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your
car is out of the question but what if they disabled your car with their
rock and then wanted to come killraperobbeat or otherwise harm you
your wife kids  
	I think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation
wouldnt you  Or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers
more than your own or those of your family  
	Dont think it couldnt happen to you  From the sounds of it here
it has happened to a few people  

	Please do not misunderstand  The only justification for using
deadly force on someone is that if you dont it will mean your own 
death or grave bodily harm  I am far far away from supporting
vilante justice or anything like that

	Oh and if you mean to be funny please add the appropriate 
	
Followups to talkpoliticsguns please  were getting a bit off track
here
