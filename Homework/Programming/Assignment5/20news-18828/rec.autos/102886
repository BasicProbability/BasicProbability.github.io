However if I were to design a BMWs electronics I will use a counter to 
count the number of times the car passed 1 million miles or whatever and 
store it in the car computers memory This could be read when doing a 
diagnostics test Ditto for the date of the odometer As easy as this is I 
dont know why manafucturers dont do it dont they to prevent illegal 
odometer tampering

But as a previous writer said it will in any case take aeons to reset an 
odometer mechanic or electronic by simulating a driving car It will be 
easier to reprogram it How I dont know

It shouldnt be THAT hard if you know much about digital electronics  If the
counter is made with standard TTL chips all you should need to do is find
the chips used for counting figure out what mileage you want to put in
and preset it but wiring the preset pins directly to lowhigh youd also have
to know what the conventions are for low and high  It might be a little more
involved than this but it shouldnt be beyond someone with a BSEE or BS EET
All the display does is convert what the counter chips say into digits using
a translation table stored in ROM

But those chips are probably inside a custom chip to make it smaller and
use less power and the presetdata pins are not going to be available
It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS 
wider operating voltage range not that the tecnology would make 
much difference
Plus the custom chip would probably be potted encapsulated with epoxy
Good luck
