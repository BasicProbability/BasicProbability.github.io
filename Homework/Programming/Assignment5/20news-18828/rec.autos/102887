 I have had two Wranglers and still have the second right now Its a
 1991 Wrangler Base model with the big I6 40L engine hard top no
 power steering or air conditioning Runs like a top Has about 37k on
 it Has never been in the shop I can change my own oil nice tall
 vehicle I can lube it myself 11 fittings I occasionally take it to
 Jiffy Lube to check the differentials and do the oil change there
 
 My previous Wrangler had nary a problem either Here in Colorado there
 more Jeeps than BMWs Mercedes Volvos and the like together In fact
 Jeep has been called the Colorado Car for a while They hold their value
 well and are very easy to resell Mine cost right around 142K new Of
 course I didnt blow money on an Islander Sahara or Renegade which
                   
I have a 92 Wrangler Sahara and paid 141 new including the rebate

 are just Wranglers with fancy inside stuff
                          
After driving a CJ5 for 6 years that fancy stuff is pretty nice

 
 The cars are primitive ride like a dump truck etc But if you live in
 an area that gets around 140 of snow per winter youd have one too
 Theyll go anywhere with a winch and are easy to get parts for The
          
I like my Wrangler but when doing some serious off roading it cant
keep up with a CJ5 because of ground clearance and limited suspension
travel  I do have a winch and would like to get an ARB airlocker in the
future

 40L engine puts out 180190 HP and gets around 20mpg Not bad

I love the 40  

 
 Just my experience Im sure there are bad ones out there but that goes
 for any make and model
