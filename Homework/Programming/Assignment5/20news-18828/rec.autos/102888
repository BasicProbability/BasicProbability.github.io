stuff about autobahn and safety of sho at speed deleted
The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO  a big power

The Mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the
SHO 
plant stuck in a midsize sedan with almost no other modifications
I have reallife experience with the Mustang  it handles like a
brick except when youre invoking oversteer of course something I

Its hard to predicatbaly drift a stock Mustang because
of the suspension

personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is
inadequate even from 80mph  Lots of accelleration  but the rest of
the car is not up to par

Yes When i think Mustang I think schoolbus   F16 motor In
my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 8090
or so It just isnt safe check out your local junkyard Mustangs
outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
junkyards

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power Ford should at least
standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 50s




I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in
mind  It didnt have to be the 911  it could have been the much
cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models  All of these
cars are fairly expensive  but so are the parts that make them
drivable at high speed  This should be elementary

There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought
it up  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but I believe
the following to be true

1 Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here

True of Northern Europe latin countries are something else

2 The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
Kindof true remember they were build by adolf in the 30s

   they are here and usually include animal fences  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways

Yes

3 Not all of Europe is the Autobahn  Most places in Europe have

Autobahn is the german word for freeway Other countries have
different names for loose equivalents autostrada autoroute motorway
etc

   speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in
   the US  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not
   much higher than 120kmh

Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit It hasnt passed as
far as I know typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
the US Law enforcement is negligible in my experience comapred
to the US as there is no revenue enhancement motivation The things
you really notice are the higher speed differentials and the more
professional attitude to driving You just never see two cars
running parallel at 551 mph oblivious to all around them


I strongly suspect you wont find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph
nearly 200kmh on the Autobahn but I could be wrong  Some people

Youre wrong GTIs  go this fast Just kind of noisy not the ideal

autobahn car A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
foot on the floor How do I know  when youre not making any ground
on the identical car in front of you

have no respect for their own lives

If something happens at 130150 youre dead but the same goes for much
over 35 Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate I feel much
safer driving 130 on the autobahn than 6080 in typical US traffic
because most people seem to be awake Ive never seen any driver reading
a book on an autobahn I see it all too often in the US

Craig

It just doesnt seem fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation everybody
drives that fast no big deal 

Craig

You certainly havent convinced me

	Of course not  Speedingisbad  Speedingisillegal 
Iwillnotspeed  IloveBigBrother  You had your mind made up
already

If you think so you sure dont pay attention to my postings
