Subject 22600 Subaru SVX   Good deal

Hi netters

My friend is seriously thinking of getting the Subaru SVX There is
a local dealer here in Seattle selling them for 22600 with
Touring package thats 7400 off from MSRP He thinks its a 
very good deal and I think so too Since he knows I have access to
the net he would like to get anyones opinion about this car especially
in the area of reliability and maintenanability
Please send email to me as my friend doesnt have access to the net

My opinion about this car is you get a lot for 22600
auto everything tranny climate control windows locks folddow rear seet
full wheel drive 22 fast 143 top spped heavy 3580lb

Thanks in advacne
