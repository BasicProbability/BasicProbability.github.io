 This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
 Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
 throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
 cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly

About a year ago some kids tossed a rock off an overpass on I94 near Eau
Claire Wisconsin and it killed the driver below  I believe he was a
schoolteacher from Minnesota

Here in Houston a couple years ago a young pregnant woman was killed
in a similar manner
