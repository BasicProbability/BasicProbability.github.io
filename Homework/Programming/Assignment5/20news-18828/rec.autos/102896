 I dont know why you are complaining about 130  Alot of us have cars that
can easily top that Most that go 130 are built to do it also and can handle
the speed  Why complain and just join in on the fast fun   Can I ask
Have any of you been at the speed of 130   Its a rush

Driving 130 in a straight line is fine you very soon become aclimated 
to it Its only a rush when there are corners that you dont
think you can make

On a clear autobahn 130 is nothing In the US 99 of people and
all judges would label you insane and it is difficult to persuade
people otherwise

Sure but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better
than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130 Dont get me wrong I love to
drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130 but thats 30 more
than Ive ever tried in it cause there isnt a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts
