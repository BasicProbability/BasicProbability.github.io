Oh yeah I had a 1975 1275GT Mini and even before I did anything
to it it could leave an MGB standing anywhere except perhaps on a long straight
motorway run at 90 

People who bought MGBs bought them because they were an open topped sportscar
and embodied what people thought they should for an old fashioned traditional
brit sportscar  not because they were great at anything

Pretty much like the people who buy the Mazda MX5 Miata today  Small 
fun and you can fool yourself and a lot of other people that you have the 
performance of many far superior and much more expensive performnace cars
