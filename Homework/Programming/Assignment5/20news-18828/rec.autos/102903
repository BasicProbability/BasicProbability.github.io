I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut It works great 
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that its just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles
Works for me I must say 


I did the same thing to my drain plug for the same reasons  I was wondering
how you filled your crankcase though as I welded my hood shut also out of fear
that somebody might steal my airfilter

Oh come on Silly all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and 
put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole  What do you
think all those big air intake things are for on those hotrod cars
Theyre just for looks onlylittle does anyone know they provide
access to the oilfill hole

Well over where we live we have problems with vandals stealing 
peoples wheels  Those locking nuts didnt stop them  So to be
safe and sure I welded the lug nuts to my wheels together  It
works serious  I havent had my wheels stolen yet
