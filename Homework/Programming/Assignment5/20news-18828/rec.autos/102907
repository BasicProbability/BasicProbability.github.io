Subject RE How is Cizeta V16T doing

I can remember reading a track competition in some carmagazine which
featured the Testarossa the Diablo and the V16T The result was about
the same I would have expected The Cizeta was not only the slowest of
the three  but also dropped out halfway during its test laps because 
of smoking brakes For a sportscar it showed ridiculous performance

Hm I find this hard to believe  V16T weights about the same as
the Red Head but it has hell lot more horse power  Perhaps its
due to preproduction glitches  Well to me it still got the most
imposing styling among all the sports cars I have seen

Ferrari F40  Best sportscar ever built
Personally I dont like cars that rely on turbo power  I guess everyone
has their favorite car
