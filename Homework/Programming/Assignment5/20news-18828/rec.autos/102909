RT had an article on cars of the SC1 ilk and they liked the Civic Ex
the Escort GT and the MX3 best of all and the SC1 was way down the
list except for braking

I just looked at that article first of all this summary is inaccurate
of 10 cars the SC1 was 5th right behind these mentioned and the Suzuki
Swift  As has been pointed out it was a semisilly comparison the
Saturn was at least 500 cheaper than the MX3 and Escort admittedly
negligible but an issue and 1500 less than the Honda The stated
goal was a base under 12k the Honda was 500 over while the SC2 at
the same price was excluded In other words they let the best Honda
play but not the best Saturn  Note that the Saturn did beat the 13k

I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest
assured that the street prices for the MX3 and Escort and maybe even
the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn youre talking about
All price comparisons Ive seen are based on MSRP and of course the
saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others
will do it way below sticker

	Id hate to rehash an old thread but  Would someone kindly quote
a prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX and Escort GT  Also Im a
assuming that the MX3 was the V6 so go ahead and look that up too  If 
someone has one of those yearly buyers guides that give a low quote price
please quote them too  Then find the the SC1 base price

Thanks
