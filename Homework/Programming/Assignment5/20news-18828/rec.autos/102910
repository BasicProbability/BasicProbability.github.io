I just visited the NY Auto Show and saw two LH cars on the floor Eagle 
Vision and Dodge Intrepid 
at a competitive price  

Unfortunately the workmanship is quite disappointing On BOTH cars
the rubber seals around the window and door fell off It turns out
the seals are just big grooved rubber band It goes on just by pressing


Through a single data point you can draw any line you want

Wrong I got two points which were the 100 sample space on the show
floor By the previous quote I guess I may drow a determinstic line

Both my pastors late model Corolla and my fathers 1987 Stanza
have demonstrated the falling door seals problem

As unfair as it may seem the difference between Chrysler and Toyota is
that Chrysler needs to prove that it can build quality cars Toyota can
afford make a few small mistakes without hurting the image

After all door seal failing on a 6year old Stanza is not comparable to 
the same problem on a brand new Intreprid
