Subject Re Do trainsbusses have radar

I dont know about trains but Ive saw a sign on the back of a
Greyhound bus that warns you that your radar detector may be set off
It doesnt explain why but it does set off my radar detector

Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their
RADAR collisionprevention system They use RADAR to monitor how close
other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are and signals
a warning to the driver if theyre coming up on something too fast
or are getting too close

This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back at
the time they were only talking about the possibility of installing
the system They didnt mention how it worked in bumpertobumper
traffic or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at
120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached 
at 60mph on a curve

I do recall something about progressive stages of warnings from
flashing lights to audible warningsie it goes from a red Too
close light to hysterically screaming WERE ALL GOING TO DIE
