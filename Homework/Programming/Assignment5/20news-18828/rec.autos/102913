Subject Re MGBs and the real world

dereknezsdciclconz Derek Tearne writes

People who bought MGBs bought them because they were an open topped sportscar
and embodied what people thought they should for an old fashioned traditional
brit sportscar  not because they were great at anything

Pretty much like the people who buy the Mazda MX5 Miata today  Small 
fun and you can fool yourself and a lot of other people that you have the 
performance of many far superior and much more expensive performnace cars

I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5 what they lack in power they
surely make up for in handling  Great for back streets with heaps of corners
They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free
revving DOHC engine a fun car  Have you driven a TURBO converted
MX5  Now they are starting to perform  Ive often thought a Mazda rotary
would go well in the XM5 tooanyone done it

Regards Scott
