I deleted your name because I dont want to sound accusative in my remark
 
 On another occasion on my way from Texas to Florida I had stopped in 
 a small motel
 for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida About 5 youths were 
 disturbing my
 car setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out When I and 
 another tenant
 walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively they vanished 
 Needless to say I immediately packedup and left
 
 Watch out for carjacking and staged accidents They can be deadly
 
Im not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if 
you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
alarm  I can think of worse things in the world  Glad you got out of there
before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun

If I hear someone screwing with my car ie setting off the alarm and
taunting me to come out you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite
will also be coming with me Its not the screwing with the car thatd
get them shot its the potential physical danger If theyre
taunting like that its very possible that they also intend to rob
me andor do other physically harmful things

If theyre just screwing around no harm done If theyre bent on
mayhem they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency a
180gr injection 1200 fpstheres no telling what todays violent
criminals will do Death may be the most pleasant outcome
