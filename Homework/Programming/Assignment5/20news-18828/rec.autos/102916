	Wasnt the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver so he
could see where he was backing up  Although reverse lights on the sides

No reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up They
arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail
lights 

I dont know where you live but I couldnt get out of my driveway
at night without reverse lights As someone said out in the country
you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
day and night At night around my house which is amongst a forest of
rather tall oaks it is DARK except for nights with full moons
Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up I greatly
prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights
