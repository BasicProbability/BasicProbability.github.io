No reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up They
arent bright enough to typically see by without the brake and tail
lights

Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights
are for couldnt we agree that they serve the dual purpose of
letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse
and that they can also light up the area behind your car while
youre backing up so you can see

Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used
to be on older cars Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright
enough to illuminate a good area behind the car and theyre 
MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s 

Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights look at a 92 or 93
model or perhaps a year or two earlier too and youll see
red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the
cars hindquarters  Those arent just white reflectors
