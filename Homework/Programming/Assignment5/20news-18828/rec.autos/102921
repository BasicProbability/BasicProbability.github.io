never catch me dead in a minivan

even a minivan based on viper running gear

hmmmm not sure since no such beast exists i can tell you another
though  you wont catch me dead in a GMC Syclone or Typhoon either
1000 bhp or not not even the fact that Clint Eastwood has one  just
my taste  no rational reasons for it

ps i think the audi S4 gets a 42 liter V8 next year

CAR just tested the S4 wagon with 5 banger and 6 speed manual  Rave
review except for Servotronic  Audi is trying to recoup the
development costs for the V8 and since the V8 is not selling well
they are sticking it into the 100 series cars Neat marketing trick
eh  yeah a 100 V832v wouldnt be a bad idea as competition for the
upcoming bimmer 530540i would it  maybe they can use a 36 liter
version to avoid conflicts with the v8 model then strip off all the
luxogarbage  let the S4 remain with the flared arches and fat tires
to go fight with the M5 maybe turn up the boost a wee bit to bump
bhp up to say 450 or so  while keeping the 100 V8 with mercedes
500E style subtlety

blah blah blah
