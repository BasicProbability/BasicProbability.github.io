Subject Re Feedback requested on lowering 66 Mustang

I have found a kit advertised for lowering the front end of an early 
mustang  Installation envolves moving the upper Aarm and installation 
of a wedge shaped spacer between the Aarm and ball joint  Apparently 
Shelby Mustangs did a similair modification but left out the spacer

I would be interested in feedback pro or con on such a modification

	Im no mustang head but dont the early ones have a simple
strut suspension that is with no upper Aarm  Just a strut
going down to a lower control arm single bushing not an Aarm with a
tensioncompression rod locating it in the forwardbackward direction

	Anyway simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
shorter springs cutting the springs lowering the spring perch or shortening
the strut below the perch  In each of these cases the suspension geometry
will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
intended angle  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom
of the strut roughly the height of the reduction will restore
the suspension geometry  IMHO the kit that includes the spacer
is the only way to go
