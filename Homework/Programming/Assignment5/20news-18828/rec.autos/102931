How do I square this with a respectable resale value  Easy if its expensive
 to buy new its gonna be expensive to buy used

A patently false statement Try this logic on an Alfa 164 In fact 
marketplace has a wonderufl mechanism to adjust the value of the cars that 
are overpriced by the manufacturer If it is expensive to buy new it is NOT 
necessarily expnesive to buy used In fact it could be real cheap to buy 
used depending what that car is of course Note that I do not question your 
statements on the reliability of Wrangler I have never owned one driven one 
or been in one I do love to have one though


 What I dont understand is why 
this apparent neglect of quality for so many years has not filtered down into 
the used marketIs Jeep so intoxicating so irresistable and so seductive as 
to make its purchase a fatal attraction

Yep  They are popular vehicles  You dont see a lot of previous model year
ones sitting on dealers lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are
out  The things sell they are popular

Because they are popular and highpriced new they are high price used very
simple

I knew they were overpriced when I bought it I knew they had a terrible 
reliability record when I bought it  But I didnt expect anything like I
got especially with a dealer network unable to repair it  Personal experience
has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine
