There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe since you brought
it up  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly secondhand but I believe
the following to be true

My knowledge about driving in the US is also secondhand but I think I can
correct your statements about our Autobahn

1 Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here

Oh yeah that would be paradise in fact you can forget it From all Ive
heard from my US relatives drivers esp here in Germany are much more agg
ressive but not disciplined One of my relatives a LA resident hired a car
at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home He said then that
he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car in
Germany again this was in 1982 and he kept his promise  the situation now is
even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic
What you mean by better disciplined should perhaps be considered cautious due
to fear 
When driving around here you always have to take into consideration that the
majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you They expect that nobody
fails or sleeps many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can
go of course only where that is allowed you might think  dream on 
So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health  and if youre ex
posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver you learn to
handle it  or you lose 
Thats the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation  
whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you I think we handle
a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest compared to
the volume and decreasing rates of lethal accidents  OTOH more and more
people esp women dislike driving because they feel overtaxed and threatened
and each accident is one accident too much

2 The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
   they are here and usually include animal fences  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways

Better designed and maintained may be  but animal fences are very rare Auto
bahnen and many other streets have guardrails I hope thats the right word  
a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights its about 2 feet high
those guardrails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road Smaller animals
can crawl under the plank bigger ones can easily jump over it The point is
that esp larger animals are very rare in Germany they tend also to be very
timid Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger

3 Not all of Europe is the Autobahn  Most places in Europe have
   speed limits that arent outofline with what we used to have in
   the US  if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not
   much higher than 120kmh

Youre right there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn 
but the attitude towards driving see above seems to be very similar to that
in Germany Ive been in France Switzerland Italy Austria Spain Belgium
the Netherlands  besides that you really cant rely on the residents abiding
the local speed limits Ive got quite a lot of practise 120k miles and Im
used to travel at 130 mph FYI with a car even smaller than a rabbit but I
consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill

I strongly suspect you wont find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph
nearly 200kmh on the Autobahn but I could be wrong 

Sorry but youll find quite a lot rabbitclasscar or even smaller mine is a
Peugeot 205 owners going that fast small cars with much HP are very hip over
here  and most people buying such cars arent afraid to let them run

                                                        Some people
have no respect for their own lives

I disagree the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant Formula1 cars
weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at
130 mph or higher  OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph
it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche a Mercedes a tank or on
a bicycle Yourre dead

And now for the next case in Kangaroo Court I accuse you of being the

sufficient  you will have to submit to examinations by a parapsychologist
