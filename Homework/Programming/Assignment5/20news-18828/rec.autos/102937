Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

I am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something
a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power I
am considering the MX6 Probe Accord Corolla and the 240SX 

I bought a 93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July now at 9500 miles
after debating over the Sentra SERNX2000 MX6 MR2 Stealth Prelude 
and Celica

The car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its
reliability so far  For what its worth my comments

My dislikes
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal

Some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented 
about this problem but I havent seen it happen on my 3 month old 
93 Probe GT  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars  Also someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it

Headlights have stuck up a few times weather
air conditioning broke 4000 miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely

Havent seen any of these problems nor have I seen these mentioned on the
mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these

crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical

Definitely

parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not 
stitched properly  Hopefully just a fluke

No problems like these either  I havent been able to find any obvious 
places where they screwed up

Ford only gives 1 key with the car  Cmon Ford spend an extra few pennies

Hmmm  I got two keys with my car  Something tells me you got stiffed by
your dealer on this  Actually if you count the credit card key that 
came in the owners binder I got 3 keys but since the credit card key
doesnt have any teeth cut in it yet I guess I wont count it 

Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  Im waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference

The latter is probably because of the air bag  Its pretty much takes up
all the space where youd expect to find the horn

Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind
The previous Probes had Japanese horns

Tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 

Yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes

My Likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely 1
handling very good for FWD understeer only at limits
transmission the 5 speed is a must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
Very little torque steer at full power much better than the 90 SHO I drive
stability at 100mph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility in front
Heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather
ABSAir bag see above
rear seats fold down I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important
No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
Tires 22555VR16 Goodyear Eagles 70 left hoping for 30K 

I agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine  The
interior is very very nice too  Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically
sound


I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the
Probes suspension doesnt like potholes  When you test drive one find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is 
tolerable

Yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  I personally like it
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car Id strongly
suggest looking into the MX6

If you have 3 passengers by all means bring them along too  Theyll find
that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides
differently if thats better is up to you  

The problem with the back seat is that theres no leg room  Plenty of 
head room though  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints
so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to 
give them a place to put their feet

Also theres a lot of glass
around you which I wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer  My back seat passengers now very few complain about
the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat

The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car 
I really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then Ive always been a sucker
for open air driving  No leakage problems or anything like thatyet

Ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine

I havent heard about this one  I know that some of the very early Probes
89 and maybe 90 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which
Ford will replace at no charge but I havent heard about anything like
this concerning the 93 Probes

I havent had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot
that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even
gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car  I was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them

From what Ive heard it sounds like FordMazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe and probably MX6 when they first went into production but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  Thats
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though

Hope this helps
