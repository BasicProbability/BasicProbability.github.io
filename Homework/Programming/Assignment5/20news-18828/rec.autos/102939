Subject Renting from Alamo	

Hello netters

Im visiting the US Im from Sweden in August I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo Ive been quoted 225 for a week 54 for additional days 
This would include free driving distance but not local taxes Baltimore 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but I doubt that
 cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than whats included in the base price But on the other hand he didnt
rent it from Alamo

Does anyone have some info on this

Is 225 a ripoff 
Probability that Ill be needing more insurance
Is the beretta a good rental car

Thanx

Markus
