Ashtrays and cigarette lighters  These should be an option

GM at least is heading in that direction  One of the postsale
questions they asked me was if Id like the choice of a cigarette
liter or an accessory plug and another whether Id like the choice of
an ashtray or a cup holder

The 93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option
which did not exist in the 92 I bought  Im not sure about the
ash tray vs cup holder  Its a step in the right direction

The ashtray does make a convenient changeholder so its not
completely useless
