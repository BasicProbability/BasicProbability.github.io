Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  Im waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference

The latter is probably because of the air bag  Its pretty much takes up
all the space where youd expect to find the horn


All Toyotas have airbags with a real horn Come on how hard can it
be to put a little pressure plate there I hope Toyota doesnt follow
everyone else and make the horns little buttons that I wouldnt want
to fumble for

To you Baldrick the Renaissance was just          
something that happened to other people            
wasnt it  The Black Adder
