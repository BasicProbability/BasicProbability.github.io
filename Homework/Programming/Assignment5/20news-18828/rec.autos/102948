I guess I wasnt clear enough here I said the roads WERE designed for 
speeds of 80 or so and still be safe The current 5565 will add a saftey
margin

	They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80  I forget the
exact spec  but for military vehicles  Thats 80 in a 1958 Dodge 
Powerwagon  Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus






Ah yes the 58 Powerwagon Now there was a vehicle that todays cars cant
touch in terms of high speed road holding ability
