be worthwhile  Or how about something like the old MGB with new technology
Just think about it  the old style with upgraded safety features and perhaps a
natural gas operated engine for less than 10K I think it would go over well

Well the MGB is currently in production for the English market built
by Rover It now has a V8 improved suspention and a slightly
updated body Too bad its only available in GB and would set one
of us back about 42000
