   Hi all A while back I was asking for info about a few different
   models the Grand Am being one of them Response was generally
   favorable one thing often repeated was go for the V6 for some
   real power Point well taken butdoes anybody have any input
   on the 4 cylinders both the standard OHC and the Quad 4
Ray

The HighOutput Quad 4 delivers 175 hp 185 for the WF41 Quad 4 whereas
the 31L V6 offered in the Grand Am delivers 140 hp  I own a Beretta GTZ

ooppssthe v6 in the grand am is the 33 litre not the 31  the 33 is
a downsized version of buicks 38 litre v6  the 31 v6 goes in the beretta 
and corsica
