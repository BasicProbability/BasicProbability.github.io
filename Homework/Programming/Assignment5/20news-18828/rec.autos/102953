Thanx to all those who responded particularly those never driven an XXX
but heres what its like guys

OK we all know that newage ATs are great in traffic and do a satisfactory
job in acceleration when you keep your foot buried in the carpet

My question regards downshifting  NOT downshifting to pass ATs are 
good at this now but manually moving the lever to 3 2 or 1 at a point
where you would downshift a manual eg approaching a red light or a 
curve or just tooling around a parking lot in 1st or 2nd wo shifting
This is why Im still a ManualTrans Bigot the downshifting for
deceleration seems so natural  When I try this in an automatic the
tranny doesnt seem to understand what I want

Addendum isnt it great after downshifting while approaching that
red light when the light goes green and youre already oncam
or the turbos already spooled up  zippppppppppp

i have a grand am with auto and quad4  around the gear selector there is a 
plastic strip which covers the space so you cant see inside  anywayi took
the cover off and cut the end of this long strip to a specific length the 
strip curls up into a cirlce at one end inside  anyway by doing this the 
strip cant feed into the lip that circles itsoi can push button pull
down and the gear shifter will only go back to 2 from driveno accidental
hitting first  i drive around town in 2 to keep the revs up  shift to drive
above 50 and pull down to 2 when coming up to lightsif i want  if i am
eating foodi drive in drive  there are probably aftermarket shift kits
that will accomplish the same thing  porsches tiptronic automatic can be 
driven like an autoor put into  mode  tip upupshifttip down
downshift  of course there is an override so you dont redline the engine
