Is it worthwhile to get an alarm system on a new car


Although others have in the past and will continue to disagree
i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm


What features are important

I think that it is important to protect your trunk engine bay all
doors  Id get flashing lights LEDs mounted on the drivers and
passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation Toss in 
a glass break sensor and shock sensor Door lock and unlock
two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have

Most important is where you have the installation done  Some places
may cost a little more but a poorly installed alarm no matter how
much it cost will be a major burden


What features are unimportant

IMO things like engine starters voice alarms windowsunroof open
and close and most other conveniences

            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
            that you probably wouldnt understand anyway
