Ashtrays and cigarette lighters  These should be an option

Why make it an option  You can use the ashtray to store coins and other
small things which come in handy Use the cigarette lighter as an electrical
outlet for all types of handy gadgets CD players vacuum cleaners
flashlights etc  I dont want to pay extra for these things and if
you dont use them they dont hurt you

I use the ashtray to keep change and other items in I converted the 
cigarette lighter into a volume control knob for my in trunk subwoofer

            The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates
            that you probably wouldnt understand anyway
