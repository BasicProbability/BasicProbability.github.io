Subject Re Ford Probe  Opinions centered around the GT


Jeremy G Mereness zonkerCMUEDU says

Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

I am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something
a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power I
am considering the MX6 Probe Accord Corolla and the 240SX 

The Probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions
But every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value
BTW the 240SX is rearwheel drive and is due for a redesign for 1994 

Thanks in Advance

While I dont read normally read this group I was looking for Valentine radar
information sigh maybe in the FAQ and came across your posting

I bought a 93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July now at 9500 miles
after debating over the Sentra SERNX2000 MX6 MR2 Stealth Prelude 
and Celica

Check this months Consumer Reports for previous Probe records  

My criteria a fun car with ABS airbag over 130hp and less than 25K
I thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out
The TriStar cars EclipseTalonetc were out since they dont have an air bag
Ditto for the Mustangalso no ABS
The SERNX2000M20 fell into the pocketrocket category  A good used car buy
The MX6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked  
I didnt like the Prelude dashinstrumentation at all  Too weird for me
The MR2 has a much smaller nonpassenger space than I needed so out that went
The Celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat
overpriced too in nonturbo form
I never considered the 240SX since it didnt have an airbag  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but thats it  The Corolla never entered my mind
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4Dodge Stealth more
Since my list was exhausted I bought the Probe  

The car design is different than earlier years so its too early to see its
reliability so far  For what its worth my comments

My dislikes
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal
Headlights have stuck up a few times weather
air conditioning broke 4000 miles pressure cycling switch
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely
crammed engine little hope for doityourselfers typical
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not 
stitched properly  Hopefully just a fluke
Ford only gives 1 key with the car  Cmon Ford spend an extra few pennies
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up  Im waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference
Tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 

My Likes
engine designvalvessoundssmoothnesspowermileagetorque  definitely 1
handling very good for FWD understeer only at limits
transmission the 5 speed is a must
usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere
Very little torque steer at full power much better than the 90 SHO I drive
stability at 100mph high gearing though
low cowl good visibility in front
Heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather
ABSAir bag see above
rear seats fold down I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important
No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still
Tires 22555VR16 Goodyear Eagles 70 left hoping for 30K 

As you can see Im primarily interested in the engine  While it doesnt
have the uummmph of a bigliter car or the turbo rush the big selling
point for me was the allaluminum 24 value 25 liter engine  

The overall car is a good buy for the money  That market segment hasnt changed
much since July Prelude VTEC Honda Del Sol  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the
Probes suspension doesnt like potholes  When you test drive one find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable
If you have 3 passengers by all means bring them along too  Theyll find
that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides
differently if thats better is up to you  Also theres a lot of glass
around you which I wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer  My back seat passengers now very few complain about
the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat  Ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine
Leather and the keyless entry system werent available when I got the car so
I cant comment on them I got the car before it was officially announced  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway  

I wouldnt want this car in the snow  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes tires arent meant for snow and the seats assume
that youre not wearing lots of thick clothing  Rain is much better  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles and I was really trying  
There is also a definite lack of cup holdersmall storage places  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door but theyre rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CDs max  The center consolestorage binarm
rest has 1 cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch
but thats it  No change holders  Quite a letdown from the SHO
And the Probe is definitely not a peoplemover car or an econobox car

Lastly dont store wet car covers in the back  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will not smell pleasant
