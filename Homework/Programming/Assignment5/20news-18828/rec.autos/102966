 Why crawl under the car at all I have a machine I got for my boat that 
 pulls the oil out under suction through the dip stick tube It does an
 excellent job and by moving the suction tube around you can get more 
 old oil out than by using the drain plug I think I paid 25 at EB Marine
 The oil goes into a steel 3 gal can  wait until it cools and decant into
 your favorite device I use soft drink bottles Easy to take them down to
 the local oil recycle center

This does sound good but I heard it tends to leave more grit etc in the 
oil pan  Also Ive been told to change the old when its hot before the
grit has much time to settle

Any opinions
