The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface
isnt much different to a typical TX freeway They are better
in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

They light the highways in Texas  Funny everywhere else Ive been
they only light em at junctions

I wont even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant

than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130 Dont get me wrong I love to

It would have to be quite severe I dont recall any US freeway
without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent well damped car

I suspect you have very limited experience  US freeways vary
dramatically particularly between states  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be
very optimistic in any car

Im not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be
considered so  Theyre hard to take at 85mph  Thats not the only
interstate Ive seen with such deviations but its one I drive
frequently

Texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such
wideopen spaces  It just aint so
