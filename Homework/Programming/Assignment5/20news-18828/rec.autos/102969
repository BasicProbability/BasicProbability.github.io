Wharf Wrat rites

They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80  I forget the
exact spec  but for military vehicles  Thats 80 in a 1958 Dodge 
Powerwagon  Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus

Ever once in a while you still see a reference to the super
slab system as Interstate and Defense Highways  But whether
the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is
another matter  A few of their most whompedup diesel trucks
maybe load permitting  The military surplus stuff Ive
driven  Jeep Classic WillysKaiserAMC preindependent
suspension and Power Wagons Slant 6 in a crewcab pickup
werent exactly congenial at highway speeds and I wouldnt
swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi

You just gotta love the standard military tire too or at
least the one they used to use  Designed circa WW II as a
compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity
on sharp rocks and so forth its quite illadapted to high
speeds on civilian roadways  For those who cant remember
what they look like imagine a mountainbike tire with a
road rib in the middle scaled up to car size Oh yeah and
narrow too One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus 
Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of
the advancements made in ride and handling since DDay

But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands  if
youre going to do 80 in a milspec 58 Power Wagon or a
Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubbertired
vehicle anywhere Id suggest the American interstate  
Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car
and skills road maintenance and the swarms of fools around
you the roads were designed for going like the devil

Naturally neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or
unlawful driving
