Subject Selling a car through a car hunter

Anybody got any goodbad experience with selling their car through one of
those car hunters  Im selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth RT and I was contacted
by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois  

They said they have 710 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldnt
be talking to me  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything
about my car and said they could sell it no problem  They guaranteed that if
they didnt sell my car in 75 days I would get my money back 389 and since
I charged it Im protected by federal law which states that if Im not satisfied
I would get a refund which is true  They federal expressed all the paperwork 
to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such

I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is
good news  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far its been
over week and I have gotten nothing  So how effective are these types of 
companies Anybody care to share their experiences
