Subject Re Trading in a car thats not paid forPointers Please

Im planning on purchasing a new car and will be trading in my 90
Mazda MX6 DX  Ive still got 2 more years to pay on it  How does
that get taken into account when I purchase my new car  Does the
dealership pay off my car and add on the amount they had to pay to
the purchase price of the new car  someone please explain this to
me

If you dont already know it you should call the bankcredit union
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost

If you are trading in your current car on the new car subtract the
payoff amount from the tradein the dealer is giving you  If this
turns out to be a negative number you need to reconsider the deal
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car

At least thats how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio


 thanks
  rhonda
