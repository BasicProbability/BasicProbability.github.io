How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children seniors the homeless

Hear hear  Thanks Robbie

You also dont read that much about violence against teenagers such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17yearolds
who were trying to surrender with bulldozers


On the other hand I think it is true without singling out teenagers
for blame that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be
Those of us whod like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages
