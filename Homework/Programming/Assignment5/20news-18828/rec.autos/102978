Hello netters

Im visiting the US Im from Sweden in August I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo Ive been quoted 225 for a week 54 for additional days
This would include free driving distance but not local taxes Baltimore 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included but I doubt that
 cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than whats included in the base price But on the other hand he 
didnt rent it from Alamo

Does anyone have some info on this

Is 225 a ripoff 
No that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city

Probability that Ill be needing more insurance
Unless you have an accident you wont need more  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars  Also your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent and
require you to initial in several spots if you dont want it  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell

I have never rented from Alamo so I dont know if they follow this
same practice

Is the beretta a good rental car
Yes  It is a compact 2door probably a bit dull performance and
accelerationwise but very adequate  It will have an automatic
transmission AMFM stereo air conditioning and possibly power 
windows and door locks
