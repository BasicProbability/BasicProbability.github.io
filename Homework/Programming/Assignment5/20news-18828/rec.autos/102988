For an all out sports car Id go for the RX7 without the sports
suspension which is too stiff  For a little more practicality and more
comfort the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy  And for a good dose of
luxury the Lexus SC300 is perfect with a manual transmission of course
However the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like its looks
the performance is supposed to be great almost race car like  I dont
particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GTs or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and arent very nimble handlers for a sports car

 The only thing about the 300ZX turbo and new Supra is theyre about 10K or
 more over his budget
