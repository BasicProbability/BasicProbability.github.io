From kmacciscocom Karl Elvis MacRae
Subject Sport Utility Vehical comparisons Any Opinions



	I just read articals on this in Road and Track and Car and Driver
	Is that one mag or two B and I was wondering if people out
	there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to
	say


	Im looking at the following three SUVs anyone whos driven all
	three have any strong opinions


	Ford Explorer
	Toyota 4Runner
	Nissan Pathfinder


	Currently Im leaning toward the Toyota cause Ive had big success
	with Toyota trucks in the past and cause I think its the best
	looking of the three But I thought Id see if anyone has any strong 
	opinions



			Thanks


	Karl
