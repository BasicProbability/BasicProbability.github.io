Is it only me or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car

It depends on your priorities  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety buying unsafe econoboxes
instead of Volvos  I personally take a middle ground  the only
thing I really look for is a threepoint seatbelt and 5mph bumpers
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls arent common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are
lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me
