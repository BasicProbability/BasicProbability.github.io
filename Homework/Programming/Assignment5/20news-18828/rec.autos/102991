anything if he hadnt emptied his gun into the asshole  Texasits
whole other country

That reminds me of one of Texass adsyou hear a guy speaking in
French like its a letter home then the French moves to the 
background and a Frenchaccented voice come to the foreground talking
about how he went walking on the beach and it felt so much like
home that he decided to take his shoes offand the rest of his
clothes It ended with please send bail 

On an recautos note does anyone carry a gun on them or keep one in
their car which is bad idea isnt it if you work in a bad part of
town or regularly go through one  Is this a loaded question  

I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded
magazine handy which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma For those
times that Im travelling interstate I keep an unloaded 
SW 44 Magnum revolver in the glove box with a speedloader
in my pocket which is legal everywhere under Federal law Illinois
State Police be hanged

As Ive said before this is stricly for defense my insurance
will pay to replace my car but I only have one life
