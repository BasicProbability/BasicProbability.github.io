Subject Re Slick 50 any good

HmmmI was listening to the local radio expert who is amazingly
enough an HonesttoGod Experttm its amazing what he knows 
and he said that based on his conversations with the inventor of 
Slick50 who is no longer with the comapny due to some kind of 
conflict he avoids it like the plague  He does recommend other 
teflonbasedtype oil additives though
