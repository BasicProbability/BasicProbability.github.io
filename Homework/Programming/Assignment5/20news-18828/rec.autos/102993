Im in the market for a new car  Currently I own a 90 Mazda MX6 DX
which has served me just fine  However Id like to get
a 4door car since I dont relish the thought of moving a carseat
around in a 2door car  My criteria are 4door ac amfm cassette
quick acceleration cruise control decent rear seat legroom my
husband is a 6footer  It must also be under 20k
preferably closer to the 1115k range which will probably rule out
the Accord  The 93 cars that have caught my eye are Toyota Corolla 
Toyata Camry Mazda 626 Pontiac Grand Am Pontiac Grand Prix 
Honda Accord and Civic if its roomy enough and still comes in a 
4door model Hyundai Sonata and maybe even a small Oldsmobile 
although not the Achieva  All opinions benchmarks
recommendations etc are welcome

I really wouldnt consider the Grand AmAcheviaSkylark all the same
since they are very bad in frontal collsions and dont have any
other really outstanding qualities

I really must object to that last statement  Having a lot of experience
with a 92 Grand Am coupe I can firmly state that they do have a lot of
outstanding qualities  Very reliable throughout  Great layout of controls
and components  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car  They 
look sharp inside and out  The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and 
drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven

All in all its a funtodrive dependable and reasonably priced vehicle
Please dont knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with
specific reasons why you feel that way
