Subject MR2  noisy engine


Gday people
	
	Are there any MR2 owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why
my MR2s engine sounds noisy The MR2s engine is noisy at the best of times 
but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises 
	I do an oil change every 23 months and for about 2 months the engine
noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling At around the 3 month
mark after an oil change Ive been tracking this very thoroughly for months
now it starts to get that very disgusting noise not so much during driving
but more so during idling 
	Whats its problem 
	Also I dont know if its just me but if noticed a little
performance drop It just hasnt got the acceleration it used to 

	Any helptips would be appreciated


Worried
