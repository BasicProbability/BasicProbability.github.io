Sounds more like an Opel GT  Neat cars fun to drive  Sold through
Buick from 196 through 1973 if I remember correctly  I believe it
was in 72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new not remfg long block  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia hmm that spelling looks hosed will be my next project
