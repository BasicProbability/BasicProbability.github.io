Subject Re Auto air conditioning without Freon  Rovax

Better still years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used
air It was called a Rovax The unit worked very well the short coming
was the seal technology Where is it today

As I recall from reading posts here a while back Rovax Rovacs died
because it was larger and noisier than the competing cheap R12 systems
of it day  Probably a case of bad timing  I think the system would
have a better chance today now that R12 systems are on death row but
investors may be hard to come by a second time
