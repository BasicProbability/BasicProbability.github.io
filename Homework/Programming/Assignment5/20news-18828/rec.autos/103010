 This happened about a year ago on the Washington DC Beltway
 Snot nosed drunken kids decided it would be really cool to
 throw huge rocks down on cars from an overpass  Four or five
 cars were hit  There were several serious injuries and sadly
 a small girl sitting in the front seat of one of them was struck 
 in the head by one of the larger rocks  I dont recall if she 
 made it but I think she was comatose for a month or so and 
 doctors werent holding out hope that shed live
 
 What the hell is happening to this great country of ours  I
 can see boyhood pranks of peeing off of bridges and such but
 20 pound rocks  Has our society really stooped this low

 Society as we have known it it coming apart at the seams The basic reason
 is that human life has been devalued to the point were killing someone is
 No Big Deal Kids see hundreds on murderous acts on TV we can abort 
 children on demand and kill the sick and old at will So why be surprised
 when some kids drop 20 lbs rocks and kill people They dont care because the
 message they hear is Life is Cheap

Well people fortunatly or unfortunatly 
only the US is experiencing the devaluation of human life among 
developed nations

I am an American but I was raised in Europe where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees

Of cource there will be some nutcases but thats extremely rare

Ie in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying

In Germany  you can walk the sidewalks at 400 am and not even look 
behind your back at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere

Of course these postings sould be in soccultureUS but if we reduce
crime here it ll mean less car insurance rates thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars Now my posting is recautostech 
revelant

I remember this happening on the I75 through Michigan and Ohio several
years back A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car
usually out of state or Canadians You stop and they smack you with a BB
bat At least they didnt kill you for the sake of a car
I think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while

Vlasis are you safe walking through Germany if you are a refugee
