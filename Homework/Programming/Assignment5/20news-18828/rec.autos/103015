How about those really ugly fake wheel compartments stuck onto the
trunk or side or both sides of some tacky luxury cars

Some of em arent fake if youre talking about the Continental kit
named after the Lincoln Continental the first car to sport one I
personally would love to have a 56 TBird with a Continental kit
and the supercharged V8  that is one of the most beautiful
cars ever built IMHO

Id go for a 39 Lincoln Continental if I could find one Sad part is
that Edsel Ford designed it and look at the abortion they named after
him Aint no justice


Okay Ill admit it looks nice on the TBird as a previous owner
of 1967 and 1968 Thunderbirds Im biased anyway
