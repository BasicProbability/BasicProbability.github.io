 Its a big aftermarket business  Almost no cars come from the factory with
 vynal any more and any fake convertible job definitely came from some
 aftermarket place  What amazes me is how much people are willing to pay for
 bad taste
 
 How about those really ugly fake wheel compartments stuck onto the
 trunk or side or both sides of some tacky luxury cars
 
 Some of em arent fake if youre talking about the Continental kit
 named after the Lincoln Continental the first car to sport one I
 personally would love to have a 56 TBird with a Continental kit
 and the supercharged V8  that is one of the most beautiful
 cars ever built IMHO

The Continental may have been the first modern era auto to mount the
spare on the rear of the car but it was hardly the first car to sport one
Various mounting techniques for rear mounting the spare were quite common
in early automobiles both US and Foreign

Right In the thirties both Buick and Packard had two spares mounted in
wells in the front fenders Of course that was back when the front
fenders were long enough to provide room There were a couple of other
marques that did this as well but memory fades

Ken Franklin 	They say theres a heaven for people who wait
AMA     	And some say its better but I say it aint
GWRRA           Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
DoD 0126       The sinners are lots more fun Yknow only the good die young
