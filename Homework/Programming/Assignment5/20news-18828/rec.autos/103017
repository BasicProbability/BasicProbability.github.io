As a long time motorcyclist I have never understood what
posessed auto builders to put delicate controls which must
be used with skill and finesse like clutches and brakes
on the floor

Why not hand control Its much much easier

In the early days neither of these functions had powerassist so
only legs had enough strength to activate them  Since then its
been traditional and people would have a hard time getting
used to anything else  

Well where exactly would you put a hand clutch and brake On
a motorcycle its easy the handlebars have a very limited
range of turning Steering wheels on the other hand turn around
and around and aroundwhich is fine for electrical relays like
your cruise control and airbagbut how many of you want to
lose your clutch andor brake due to a short circuit

Shades of the Edsel They had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hub
that controlled the auto tranny It was very disconcerting to shift
into reverse when turning a corner and the wires shorted

There are workarounds but theres really no reason to use hand
power on a cars clutch or brakes and lightening them to the
point that they are finesse controls suitable for hand use
would increse the mechanical complexity substantially look at
power brakes and nonpower brakes for an example

I saw an experimental car that had a joystick instead of a steering
wheel

Thats about useless IMHO 

Another automotive oddity is separate keys for trunks doors and
ignitions Why on earth would you want this

I know I dont

I want a separate trunk key for security reasons it gives me a totally
separate lockable container For door and ignitionehhh the same keys
OK I guess
