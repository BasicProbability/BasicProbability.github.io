Subject Re RE Aftermarket AC units

Les Bartels comments
Sorry I cant help you with your question but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket AC units  I have a FrostKing or FrostTemp
forget which aftermarket unit on my Cavalier and am quite unhappy with
it  The fan is noisy and doesnt put out much air  I will never have
an aftermarket AC installed in any of my vehicles again  I just cant
trust the quality and performance after this experience
  les

Let me add my 02 in I had a AC installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the AC that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine I have talked to other people that have had the same
result Dont know if this is just a probable with Ford or what

i agree never have the dealer add anything to your car  if you want ac
make sure it is factory installedhondas maybe excluded many cant be 
bought with ac installed at the factory but i think maybe they actually
use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one inas
in bigger radiator etcor are designed properly for this in the 1st place
anyway my point is the dealer installed ac wont be anywhere near as good
as factory and the service bums will mess up your car when installing it
scratches screwdriver holes in seatsparts not reinstalled correctly or 
with all the screws etc  i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm
dealer for 18 yearshe said never have a dealer add anything to your car
except maybe floormats
