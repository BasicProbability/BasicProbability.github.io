The Taurus SHO for those who can get it straight it is SHO as in Super 
High Output not SHO as in show has a Yamaha 30L DOHC 24 valves SHO V6 

Having spoken to technical staff from Ford many times I can assure you that 
internally at Ford this car is always called the Taurus Show or just  
the Show  As in long o sound  I still refer to it as the SHO
however because it sounds better to me I assume many purist fans and owners 
prefer using the Ford lingo
