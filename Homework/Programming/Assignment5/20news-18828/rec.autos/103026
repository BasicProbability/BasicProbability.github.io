my series of exams and NOon hand reference here

	Is it still possible to get those cute WWII VW Jeepwannabes
A replica would be great I think

The VW Thing Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and 
possibly South America  Good luck importing one  They probably dont meet 
US safety and pollution requirements  There are mechanics and junkyards 
which specialize in VW they might be helpful for finding a Thing unless 
the WWII reenacters have grabbed them all

The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep but was not 4
wheel drive  One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox Kentucky 
also the rare Schwimwagen sp amphibious version in fullscale dioramas
Highly recommended
