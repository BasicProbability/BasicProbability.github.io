Subject Re Auto air conditioning without Freon


It is actually simple in principle Porous adsorbents like zeolite and
activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate water
or methanol etc giving the cooling effect  Upon being heated the 
gassaturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be
condensed  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle  The only problem
is that the COP is very low 02 06
