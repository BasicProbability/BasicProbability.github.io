I just started reading this thread today so forgive me if it has already been
mentioned  Butwhat was the deal with Renaults putting the horn on the
lefthand turnsignal stalk  It was a button on the end where the washer
button would be on the wiperwasher stalk  Could the Frenchies not figure
out the wiring through the steering wheel or what

Had an 83 Alliance for a long time  It was a comfortable but sluggish
car  I got very used to the horn on the stalk after a couple months worth
of getting used to it  After I bought my next car a Chevy it took me
forEVER to get used to the horn on the steering wheel again
