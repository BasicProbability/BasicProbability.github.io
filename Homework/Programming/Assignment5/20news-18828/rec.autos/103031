I think hes talking about a different form of rush Evidently its fun to be
terrified But hey if you want that kind of rush try bobsledding You may
only get up to 80 or so but it makes 130 in a car feel like a stroll in the
park

Why should a good driver be terrified at 130mph The only thing I fear
going at 130 are drivers who switch to the left lane without using
either rearviewmirror or flashers Doing 130 to 150 aint a rush
for me but its fun and I get where I want to go much faster

But in one point You are quite right If You are terrified at 130 You
should better not drive that fast or Youll be a hazard to others

BTW before You flame me read my EMail address I know what Im 
talking about as I live in Germany

not a flame just a point  Id be scared at 130 here not because i feel
I  or my car couldnt handle it but because of exactly what you said
drivers who are STUPID  Like the ones who are doing 130 also and so
they pull in right behind you at maybe 12 car lengthsoh yeah real
smart  This scares me in cities at 50  When i cant see enough of
the car to make it recognizable they are following TOO CLOSE  And 
when i see them doing this AND reading a newspapersighthis
is why America has 5565 speed limits our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise
that reading the paper should be done at breakfast or work not in their
car  

my thoughts
