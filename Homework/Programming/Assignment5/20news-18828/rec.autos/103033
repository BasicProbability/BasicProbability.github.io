Well I guess I know for sure what I meant and it is this  I dont know where
you drive but around here freeways are often clogged solid with large packs
of semis trucks and cars of all descriptions  When I close on one of these
rolling clusterfs on the highway I have no desire to add my vehicle to this
rolling accident looking for a place to happen If there were any way to pass it
I WOULD BE PASSING MYSELF however I cant      As I posted before all it
takes is a blown tire or some moron tramping on the brakes to turn this pack 
into a cloud of shredded metal flying glass and burning vehicles   I want to
maintain enough free space between myself and this mess to at least have a
minimal chance to avoid a mass crash That means maintaining a clear space 
between me and it
However there is no end of shortdriving morons who are dying to pass so they
can add themselves and their car to the bodycount  That wouldnt bother me so
much except that after letting enough of these morons pass me and glue themselves
to the pack ahead my interval is filled up Trying to back off further does not 
work because the road behind me has filled up trapping my car right into an ever
increasing pack  Now if there was any slight possibility that there was a lane
open ahead Id be glad to move over But there usually is no way in hell that
anybody is going anywhere So I block the wouldbe passers Not only for my own
good  but theirs as well even though they are often too stupid to realize it


Just an comment  I dont like it when people decide whats good for me
If you think youre going to decide anything for me youd better be 
carrying a badge and a gun  Who made you capable of determining if there
is no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere  Why do you find 
it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
business  If someone is minding their own business I will give them
all the room they want and Ill try to make things easy for them even
letting them in in front of me if they ask politely with a directional
On the other hand if someone like you decides they want to block me and
be a general asshole you can bet your ass that Ill make life as 
miserable as possible for you as long as it doesnt affect anyone else
whos minding their own business  
They have a phrase to describe someone like you
Self Appointed Traffic Police
Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong

As a rule of philosophy I dont feel particularly sorry when somebody gets 
offed by his own stupidity but It does worry me when some idiot is in a position
to cash in my chips too
