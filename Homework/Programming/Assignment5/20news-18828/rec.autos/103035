 I take the electrodes of the AmpOhmVolt meter whatever and connect one
 to each earlobe  Then symmetrically insert my fingers in each of the
 spark plug boots No cheating guys  both hands must be used
 
 I have just a couple of questions about this technique
 
 First what firing order should I use  Do I start with my pointer
 finger or my pinky  Left hand or right
 
 And secondly I have a 12cyl and there are two cylinders unaccounted
 for  Any suggestions

How about your two big toes  And while youre at it why bother with removing
the drain plug when you could remove the dipstick instead and suck it out from
there with your mouth and then spit it out
