 Ok Ill give you a few reasons
 
 1 Neither car was designed to turn at those speeds
 2 Neither car was designed to stop quickly from those speeds
 3 Safety mechanisms were not designed for impacts at those speeds
 4 An uncontrolled environment leads to unpredictable circumstances
    where you might need to turn or stop with no notice


Do you by any chance own an SHO or have access to one such that you
would have any idea what it is designed for or how it handles

Just wondering
