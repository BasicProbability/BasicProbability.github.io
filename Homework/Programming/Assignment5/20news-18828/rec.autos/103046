As long as were on the subject Several years ago myself and two others
were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5
north of Seattle WA Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield Not by accident Im sure it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it We figured it was kids reported it and
left
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company He was
in his midfourties and left behind a wife and children Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away They caught the 14 year old
that did it They put a cover over the overpass what else could they do

Execute the juvi on the grounds of the reformatory required attendendence
by the rest of the inmates as soon as possible after the incident and a
quick sure trial  I am quite serious  Cause and effect  Nothing else
will ever make a dent

I dont think Ill over forget this story
