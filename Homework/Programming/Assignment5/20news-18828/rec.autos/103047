sorry for the 0 auto content but  

 That is why lowabiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves
 and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is 
 imminent

You do have the power Steve You can do it Why dont you Why dont you
go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars Make sure you do a good
job though  dont miss  cause like they have big rocks  and take it from
me  those kids are mean

That is absolutely correct  They have a streak of meanness that runs much
deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height
of the 60s racial struggles  I am absolutely convinced that there are
kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong but have the
human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that
have ever walked the earth  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity
decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral
humans and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their
own protection  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities
and police for protection the police and government is soon composed of
the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from

Gee I guess you touched my hot button  Id better go cool off somewhere
