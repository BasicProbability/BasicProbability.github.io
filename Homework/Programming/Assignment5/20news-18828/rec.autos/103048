Im considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

Ive read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts Im not sure where


Geico has purchased radar guns in several states I know they have done
it here in CT

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped  And once
youve been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance

My suggestion stay where you are or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico

Jeff
