Subject Dirty Diesels

I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to clean up
diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter  Id assume easier
since were removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses  Lets hear peoples opinions
