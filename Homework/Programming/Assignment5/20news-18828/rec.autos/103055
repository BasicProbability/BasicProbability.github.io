Im looking for information on Opel cars  Now you ask which model
Well the sad truth is Im not entirely sure but its a twoseater
with rollover headlights hard top and really sporty looking  My
friend has one sitting in his yard in really nice condition
bodywise but he transmission has seized up on him so it hasnt run
for a while  Does anyone have any info on these cars  The engine
compartment looks really tight to work on but it is in fine shape and
I am quite interested in it
Thanks

	This would be the manta would it not  Sold through Buick dealers in the mid 70s as the price leader

Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me Id guess that this is on the same
chassis as the Kadett rather than the bigger Manta  but I could easily
be wrong  I think the later Kadetts were sold here as Buick Opels

Craig

	I think the Manta is the European name for the GT  Im pretty sure
Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies There is
little or no chance that they are the same The Manta went through several
generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time

that the only Kadetts sold here wereare the Pontiac LeMans  I think the

Not true The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years
The LeMans old Kadett is only the latest version 

Craig
GT is just an early 70s to mid 70s Manta  

Different Cars One looks like a sportscar the other is a coupe
