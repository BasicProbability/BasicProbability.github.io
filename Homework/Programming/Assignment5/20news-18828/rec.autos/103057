Subject Re New 94 Talon


I would also be interested in finding out about the 94 Talon
and I suspect that many other people would be interested too
so lets get some responses on the net

The question again
Does anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon  Mitsubishi
Eclipse  Plymouth Laser

I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant
and that in Japan a 240 hp twinturbo V6 1994 Galant has been
released

So anyway any info on the 94 Talon would be appreciated
