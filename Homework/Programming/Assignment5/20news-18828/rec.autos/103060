 	Recently I saw an ad for the altima which says that it is the  
 best seller for the past 6 months is that true 
 
 
 I too was puzzled by this obvious untruth What I think is going on is that
 Nissan claims that the Altima is the best selling new car namelplate in
 the US I think I have this near verbatim Lee Iaccocas statistics
 dept would have been proud of that sentence What they mean I think is
 that of all totally new models ie cars never sold before in any
 form the Altima is the best seller thereby eliminating Accord Taurus
 etc 
 THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin
theirs implying that the Nissan Quest Murcury Villager are outselling
the Chrysler minivans not only is this not true at all but it was a stupid
claim to make the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
vans  Kind of a bold statement to make when you havent even sold one yet eh


And I thought Buick and Oldsmobile where bad  Shame on you Nissan and 
Mercury
 
 Any other interpretations
