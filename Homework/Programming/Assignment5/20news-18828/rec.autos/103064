	That shows how much you know about anything  The brakes on the
SHO are very different  9 inch or 95 I forget discs all around
vented in front  The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front 
drums rear

one i saw had vented rears tooit was on a lot
of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right
then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still
crap since Al is so m uch cheaper and just as good

i tend to agree tho that this still doesnt take the SHO up to standard
for running 130 on a regular basis  The brakes should be bigger like
11 or sotake a look at the  ones on the Corradoswhere they have
braking regulations

Well lets seemy TBird SC has a computercontrolled adjustable
suspension 4wheel ABS disks 11 vented front 10  rear 3point
							
						Rears also vented

belts sturdy passenger compartment aerodynamics good enough for 
NASCAR without too much change 210 hp310 ftlb supercharged 38l V6
4wheel independent suspension plus limitedslip differential with 
a top speed in excess of 130mph and rides on Vrated tires I have yet
to find 22560R16s in any other speed rating 

Is that up to standard If not why not

james i really hate to do this but try reading the damn posts

Then you shouldntve done it Try answering the damn question
I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC
in there

never was a tbird mentioned  The discussion was about SHOs and
stangs not being up to spec  I do not know about tbirds  I
only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded
a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff  This does not
kn any way  disencourage me from wishing to own one nor does it make it
a bad car  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra
bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes as the wheels are plenty large
enough for them to fit if memory serves right which it may very well not
and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it

Well my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar
characteristics front and rear disks ABS on the SHO high output
V6 4wheel independent suspension very good aerodynamics 3point
harness fat rubber and 130mph top speed If one of them is 
up to standard and I think the SC is but the other isnt then
why is that No flamage just curiousity
