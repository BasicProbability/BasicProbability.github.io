Subject Re MR2  noisy engine


Eliot is right about 22 liter engine in the second and last generation
MR2s But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR2 If its a
first generation car like my 85 it has 16 liter engine or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger if its 87 89
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard
I dont know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise Not all that annoying mind you But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear

Sorry bout that  Mine is a 91 model nonturbo 20 with ABS and revised
suspension whatever revised means Im in Australia so we always seem to 
get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as 
standard

My query is  why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 23 months after
an oil change I just find it a bit wierd that this happens Is it the oil Im
using Mobil 1 or is it the engine the 3SGE versionmodel ie gets
noiser the older the oil is Im only guessing 

Its not annoyingly distressing or anything but just slightly puzzling
