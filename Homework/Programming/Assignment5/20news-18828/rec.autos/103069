  my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car

I was about to recommend you consider a targa top over a convertible but 
DREW made the point very well  When my wife and I were in our 20s we
did the convertible thing with Triumphs  Now in our mid40s we still
appreciate the open air but prefer targa types  There is much less wind
noise objectspapers blowing around foreign objects getting into the
car and one still has almost all the advantages of the convertible  

Tom

while its being mentioned i personally prefer the moonroofsunroofttop
targa thing as well  I simply dont like cloth tops nor the extra insurance
nor the S color matching alot of companies do  If i chose a convertible
itd be

a Mazda RX7 II  I just like the way they look  Itd have to be in black
with color matched black topthey look good

b VW cabriolet  They do a suberb job of matching colors too  Also last year
for them  COLLECTORS ITEM

c mustang GT droptopthey look ok too

i know this doesnt help but i thought id do it anyway

good luck to your wifeand you 

DREW
