 As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
 here in Europe they are rare Just wondering

In many of our cities there are traffic signals every 100 feet unsynchronised
of course well here in Ottawa anyway and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot  Also most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually gee I gotta coordinate my two
feet on the clutch brake and accelerator and I gotta steer shift and
operate the signals optional and radio with my two hands duh it 

i agree wholeheartedly

cant be done  Also most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money

not sure about there in CA but here in US the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment  Of course FINDING a car with one might be hard but
if you read the sticker on the window there is usally an additional 2k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny  So you actually ARE paying more just
that its sometimes hard to find one that is equipped standard  this
applies to MOST cars but not to the luxoyachtseg caddilac licolns etc
