Im looking for information on Opel cars  Now you ask which model
Well the sad truth is Im not entirely sure but its a twoseater
with rollover headlights hard top and really sporty looking  My
friend has one sitting in his yard in really nice condition
bodywise but he transmission has seized up on him so it hasnt run
for a while  Does anyone have any info on these cars  The engine
compartment looks really tight to work on but it is in fine shape and
I am quite interested in it
Thanks

	This would be the manta would it not  Sold through Buick dealers in the mid 70s as the price leader

Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me Id guess that this is on the same
chassis as the Kadett rather than the bigger Manta  but I could easily
be wrong  I think the later Kadetts were sold here as Buick Opels

	I think the Manta is the European name for the GT  Im pretty sure
that the only Kadetts sold here wereare the Pontiac LeMans  I think the
GT is just an early 70s to mid 70s Manta

The GT was based on the Kadette chassis It was built model years 19691973
The Manta came out in the 1974 model year and was a 4 seat coupe
