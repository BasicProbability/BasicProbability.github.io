Im considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

Ive read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts Im not sure where
