In a previous article jkjecwestminsteracuk Shazad Barlas says

The best autoshifters on the street AND NOT THE TRACK are those from 
Porsche they wont change if you floor the gas during a turn a few 
years back a was in a 200SX auto you guys call it a 240SX without turbo
and was going round a corner I floored it and next thing I know I was 
pointing backwards The other drivers seemed quite amused 

						Shaz


You are sure that what you call a 200SX we call a 240  Just curious
We also have a nissan predacessor sp to the 240 called a 200 which
came in turbo and nonturbo  But i dont think weve ever had a 240
turbojust curiousBTW Im in the US if that matters
