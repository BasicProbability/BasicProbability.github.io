Subject 93 Hyundai SonataOpinionsInfo Wanted


Id like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata  I
know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that
have them swear by them  They also havent had the problems with
them that Consumer Reports claims  I havent driven one yet  I
have driven a 93 Hyundai Elantra which Consumer Reports also
trashed and was very impressed with it  The local Hyundai
dealership nohaggle policy is offering an Elantra GLS w power
moonroof for 13163  They also have a Sonata base w Sunroof for
13997  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w sunroof and
4spd automatic  Ill decide which engine I prefer after test
driving both the 4cyl and the V6  The Sonata is also offering a
1500 rebate  Hmmm thats another question  Is the following
scenario the appropriate manner to handle negotiation

1  make offer
2  subtract rebate from offer
3  talk trade
4  subtract trade from offer to get final price
