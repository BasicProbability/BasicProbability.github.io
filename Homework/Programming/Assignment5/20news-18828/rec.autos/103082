Subject Re MR2  noisy engine

In article 1r3oe8c93usenetINSCWRUEdu aas7poCWRUEdu Andrew A Spencer writes
nice theory  too bad the MR2s never came with a four cylinder over 20
liters  More like 16  Or did they were the nonturbo MR2IIs  22 or
some such

foot in mouth again drew  the first generation mr 2s were 16s which 
were very smooth  id be real surprised if the original poster was talking
about a 1st generation car  the second generation cars were 22 for the
non turbo and 20 for the turbo  i drove the non turbo 22 and calling it
unpleasant is to be kind to it 

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented designlike Porsches 30 I4

wrong and wrong  mitsubishi owns the patent which has since expired
which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance
shafts into their big 4s the notable exception is nissan and only
for the us market suckers  i guess we need to write to CD and start
telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm  then
youll see usenet discussions of the form engine A has peak
vibrations 3 dB less than engine B therefore engine A is better than
engine B
