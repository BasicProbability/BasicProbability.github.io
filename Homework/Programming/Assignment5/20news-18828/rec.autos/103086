This isnt anything new  Back in 1985 I was driving under a high
overpass at night on I805 in San Diego when I caught a glimpse of
someone on the overpass  As I passed under a rock slammed against the
metal between the winshield and right front window  My girlfriend was
in the seat next to it  I called the police from the next exit but I
doubt if they were found

About five years ago in San Diego someone was put into a coma from a
brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and
subsequently crashed  I dont think he ever came out of the coma and I
havent heard anything about it for a couple years

I know that this isnt the group for it but since you brought it up
does anyone have any idea why they havent bombed the Waco cult    

Probably because there are many children there  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
they havent threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
for a mass murder of Koresh and his followers

Sorry for posting this to this group but I thought the previous post
needed a rebuttal  If you followup to this portion please crosspost
and direct followups to a more appropriate newsgroup
