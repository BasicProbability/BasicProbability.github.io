Hi	
I am dying to get the  answer for the pricing polocy of a dealer
here  in San Jose California I moved to caal  from AL

You moved from Alabama to California  My sympathies

Year	Model	Description		Milage	Price
1991	318	Black Looks good     46K	106K
		5sp  manual AC 
		Cassette Sun roof 

1989	318	White  same as aboove   50K	 96K


Make sure that they have all maintenance records  Oil should be changed
every 3 months  The mileage on the cars is fine

Be sure that these have the 16 valve engine  The 8 valve 318 is a 
BMW in name only  

Didnt you have a line on a 89 325i for 12K Jump on it
