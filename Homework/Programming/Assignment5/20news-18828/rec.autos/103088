Because I want to get the lowest price possible its called capitalism

I have news for you  capitalism is the practice of maximizing
profits

Same difference if you lower your costs you increase your profits

Personally Im not at all bothered by the Saturn pricing scheme  If I
dont want to pay as much as theyre selling it for I can go buy a
different car from a different dealer and they get nothing  Thats
competition for you  If the dealer can be competitive charging what
they do and making that kind of profit thats capitalism at its best
and more power to em


Id rather have the consumer dictate what things will cost not the
dealers

Sorry but neither dictates the cost Its a negotiation
Whether its up front at a honda dealership in an all out 
dickering war or more removed on a larger economic scale
ie if saturn cant sell at its price the price drops
or the company stops building them it remains a negotiated
value controlled by market forces To think that the consumer 
controls price is ludicrous If the consumer controled
price then cars would be freeAnd no one would build 
cars
