I take the electrodes of the AmpOhmVolt meter whatever and connect one
to each earlobe  Then symmetrically insert my fingers in each of the
spark plug boots No cheating guys  both hands must be used

I have just a couple of questions about this technique

First what firing order should I use  Do I start with my pointer
finger or my pinky  Left hand or right

Place your hands flat on a table and arrange the firing order from left to
right

And secondly I have a 12cyl and there are two cylinders unaccounted
for  Any suggestions

Well you have friends dont you
12 cylinders might be more excitement than one person can take
