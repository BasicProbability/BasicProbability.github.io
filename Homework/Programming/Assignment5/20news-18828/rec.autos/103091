  Is there going to be a BMW 328 in 1994
 
 Could be  Isnt the 25 liter six supposed to be enlarged to 28 liters
   in the nottoodistant future
 

Makes sense since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 22L4 to a 28L6
Nothing in between  BTW I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are
156 and 225 hp respectively  The oneupmanship in hp might induce BMW
to create a larger six  Also the 26 190E has lagged behind the 3er
25 for some time wrt hp   I am sure the Bavarians wouldnt want to be
shownup by the Schwabians

PS those MB engines havent been released over here yet
