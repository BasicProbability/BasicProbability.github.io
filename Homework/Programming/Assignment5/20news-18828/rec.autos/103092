If I hear someone screwing with my car ie setting off the alarm and
taunting me to come out you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite
will also be coming with me Its not the screwing with the car thatd
get them shot its the potential physical danger If theyre
taunting like that its very possible that they also intend to rob
me andor do other physically harmful things

Here in Houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her
garage so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand  She
found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle  She quite
reasonably asked him to stop  He refused began taunting her and
as the woman was quoted in the police report He told me to go
ahead and shoot him so I did  The moron survived and no
charges were filed against the woman
