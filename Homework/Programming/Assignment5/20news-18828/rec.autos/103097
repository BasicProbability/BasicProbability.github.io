 Its a big aftermarket business  Almost no cars come from the factory with
 vynal any more and any fake convertible job definitely came from some
 aftermarket place  What amazes me is how much people are willing to pay for
 bad taste
 
 How about those really ugly fake wheel compartments stuck onto the
 trunk or side or both sides of some tacky luxury cars
 
 Some of em arent fake if youre talking about the Continental kit
 named after the Lincoln Continental the first car to sport one I
 personally would love to have a 56 TBird with a Continental kit
 and the supercharged V8  that is one of the most beautiful
 cars ever built IMHO

The Continental may have been the first modern era auto to mount the
spare on the rear of the car but it was hardly the first car to sport one
Various mounting techniques for rear mounting the spare were quite common
in early automobiles both US and Foreign

The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the continental
kit The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside
mounting bracket a continental kit is a very specific ornamentstorage
compartment The 1941 Continental has a neat trunk it looks rather
like a laundry hamper IMHO
