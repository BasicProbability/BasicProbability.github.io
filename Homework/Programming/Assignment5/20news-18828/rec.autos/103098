WAGON which I have heard is somehow slightly faster than the Coupe

	Wagon has an automatic its slower

Could be due to the rearend ratio also  

Usually automatics have different rearends than manuals from
my limited experience anyways

Youll have fun looking for the rearend gears on an SHOthe Taurus
is a frontwheeldrive vehicle

I went back and checked the article again The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic but significantly slower than the REAL SHO

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you cant handle a stick you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to
say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg
disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an
SHO anyway 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the 50l
Mustangs Camaros and the like wed cut down on the number of
accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars IMHO
