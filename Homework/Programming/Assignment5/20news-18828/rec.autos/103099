Subject Is this a good price 



   Hi everybody

   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe  The dealer ask 12750 for it
including AC  installed  but not including stereo tax registration
fees  I live in Mexico so I dont have time to go to a lot of dealers
and compare their prices  The dealer is in McAllen Tx  Is this a good
price for that car   If not how much should I pay for it 

   Please email ASAP if you dont want to post  Thanks a lot
