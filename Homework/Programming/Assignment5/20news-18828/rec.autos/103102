If Im not mistaken altering the odometer is illegal  Furthermore
I surmise itll be tough to alter BMWs odometer if you got at it
Some of the newer BMWs have electronic odometers making it even
more tamperproof

On the cars mentioned  3 series from the late 80s the electronic
odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer that is driven
by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle  These pulses are 
converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer  and speedometer
No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
reading  It also means the odometer is just as easy or hard to
change as any other mechanical odometer

On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
and run the car with no speedometer or odometer readinga simple
switch will do the job  It also will disable the speed limiter
which will enable the car to reach its full speed
