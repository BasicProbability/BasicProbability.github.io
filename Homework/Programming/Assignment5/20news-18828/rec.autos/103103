Subject insurance says car is totalled




		on wednesday morning another driver decided to illegally
		turn left in front of me doing great damage to my car
		Honda Civic
		i have yet to pay off the car and the body shop says the
		insurance company wants to total the car  i havent
		been able to get in touch with the person handling my claim
		so i checked on some things
	
			1 my payout is 370000
			2 Blue Book retail is 565000
			3 loan value is 445000
			4 tradein value is 400000

		could anyone give me any advice on what i shouldcould do
		if the insurance company does not give me a reasonable
		amount for the loss of the car
