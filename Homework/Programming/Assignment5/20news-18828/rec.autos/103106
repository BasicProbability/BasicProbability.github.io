Subject Re Its a rush was Re Too fast


In a previous article gwmspl1splloralcom Gary W Mahan says

Why should a good driver be terrified at 130mph The only thing I fear
going at 130 are drivers who switch to the left lane without using
either rearviewmirror or flashers Doing 130 to 150 aint a rush
for me but its fun and I get where I want to go much faster

In defense of the drivers who are in the right lane  Here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50mph  I dont think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit Do you in the states when you look in the rearview ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50 speed differential  
Dont get me wrong I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right I slow down a tad bit If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential I would be the stupid one  

just to satiate my curiosity why would this make you the stupid one  It seems
to me everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on  You do not need
to calculate the future position  You need to look at your mirrors a little
more  If you glance around you will be able to tell how much faster than you
the car is going  Maybe not precisely but well enough to know if you should
let him around before you try to pass  I know what you are talking about
about the other driver being startled because i myself have been startled
by drivers cruising by at around 90100mph when im doin 5565  The problem
though as i saw it was not their fault for barreling around me but my fault
for not paying the attention to my taskathand that i should have been
Oddly enough since the 2nd timehappened 2x in around 4 mo when id had my
liscence for around 6 mo i havent been startledand ive been passed by
cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car  Another odd occurance is the
fact that this only seems to happen on LONG tripsand if i drive along with
them it doesnt happen at all  even on the long trips   adrenaline
will do that to youive had bad cop experiences with speeding so anything
over the limit is adrenalizing for mescared ill get caught   Maybe
they should raise the limit so we can pay better attention

just curious and my otwo

DREW
