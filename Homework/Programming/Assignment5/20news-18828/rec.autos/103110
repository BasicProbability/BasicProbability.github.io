Subject Re Too fast

In article 1qkon83rearmorycenterlinecom jimfcenterlinecom Jim Frost writes
larger engine  Thats what the SHO is  a slightly modified family
sedan with a powerful engine  They didnt even bother improving the
brakes

	That shows how much you know about anything  The brakes on the
SHO are very different  9 inch or 95 I forget discs all around
vented in front  The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front 
drums rear

	Your argument still boils down to An SHO shouldnt be driven
fast because I Jim Frost say it isnt designed to go fast

	Pffffftttttt

If you think so you sure dont pay attention to my postings

	Damn straight  Youre one of those people who makes stuff
up and tries to pawn it off as Gods own truth  If I want lies I can
go listen to television
