Subject differences in insurance companies rates

I am considering buying an new car so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates I asked for the same
coverage and same deductibles Most of the companies charge you
according to your zip code Others charge according to your city
Anyhow I gave the same zip code and city to all three places Heres
what I found for a 93 Integra GS

AAA 2000yr
State Farm 261492yr
Allstate 1220yr

AAA is nonprofit so they said I could also expect to receive about
200300 back at the end of the year

Still There is a huge gap between all of these companies State Farm
wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate I think I should be
suspicious but Ive never heard anybody else complain

Any comments

Thanks
