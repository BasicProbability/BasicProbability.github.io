After many trips to the dealer who has admittedly been patient with me
they are admittedly going to do nothing about it
The dealer did however follow the Bulletin and review proper shifing
procedures with the owner
My next attempt at satisfaction in the Customer 800 number but from the first
round it doesnt sound too hopeful


Im surprised I know of a local case where a guy took his Saturn back five
times to complain they hadnt properly eliminated a rattling noiseso Saturn
gave him a new car

Call that 1800 number
