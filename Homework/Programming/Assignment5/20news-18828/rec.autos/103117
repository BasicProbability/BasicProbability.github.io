larger engine  Thats what the SHO is  a slightly modified family
sedan with a powerful engine  They didnt even bother improving the
brakes

	That shows how much you know about anything  The brakes on the
SHO are very different  9 inch or 95 I forget discs all around
vented in front  The normal Taurus setup is smaller discs front 
drums rear

one i saw had vented rears tooit was on a lot
of course the sales man was a fooltitanium wheelsyeah right
then later told me they were magnesiummore believable but still
crap since Al is so m uch cheaper and just as good


i tend to agree tho that this still doesnt take the SHO up to standard
for running 130 on a regular basis  The brakes should be bigger like
11 or sotake a look at the  ones on the Corradoswhere they have
braking regulations

DREW
