Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you cant handle a stick you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to
say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg
disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an
SHO anyway 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the 50l
Mustangs Camaros and the like wed cut down on the number of
accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars IMHO

I have to disagree with this  I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4speed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  I live 
in the Dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to a manual would be
more fun  

Safetywise an auto is less distractingI would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
Performancewise I can hold my own against any stock 50 Mustang or 50
Camaro w a five speed  

All of this IMHO 

all of my HOs disagree with your HOs  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick
detested it in the autolike i did any other time in the auto  Of course
Dalls rush hours are nothing from what i hearif i lived in LA i might
be of a different persuasion  And just for the record rarely do you shift
gears when merging into trafficthat is what 5 speeds are good for4th is
good up through around 8090 most of the time so you can just wind it out
its not going to hurt anything and keeps it in the powerband anyway
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4thfairly rare
unless you drive a ferrari or some such id bet or when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortableor when my mother is sitting in the 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her poor little engine way
too hi 
Just my HOs
