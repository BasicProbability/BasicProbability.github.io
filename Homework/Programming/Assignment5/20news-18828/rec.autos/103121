Im considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

Dont worry about this  theyll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim Theyll just make filing the claim a pain but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch

Ive read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts Im not sure where
More than that GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units GEICO started giving them away I
  know theyve given units to the Florida Highway Patrol County Sheriffs a
  and some local governments
The real question is why This is the hook GEICO and other Ins Cos can
  tell which drivers represent risk This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICOs LIDAR units Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK Its called
  extra profits They also know how silly the NSL is and how it is almost
  universally ignored Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket an
  increase in your rates points on your license  but it doesnt make you
  a riskier driver to insure
Like the sound of this Like the people who thought up the scheme Go GEICO

Unless you have some driving history problems youre usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there Youll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums Now about the  of your premium that is paid as
commission Thats another story for another day
