Subject Borgward question


My exhusband  I used to own Borgwards  Havent seen any for a long
time  They were really good cars  Does ayone out there know anything
about them now  I heard they were being made in Mexico but of course
they wouldnt be the original German  if thats even true  When Ive
been in Mexico I havent seen any  We loved ours even tho they were
ugly  they had names  one was Humphrey Borgward
