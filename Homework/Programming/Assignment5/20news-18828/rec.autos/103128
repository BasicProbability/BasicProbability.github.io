They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80  I forget the
exact spec  but for military vehicles  Thats 80 in a 1958 Dodge 
Powerwagon  Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus

Ever once in a while you still see a reference to the super
slab system as Interstate and Defense Highways  But whether
the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is
another matter  A few of their most whompedup diesel trucks
maybe load permitting  The military surplus stuff Ive
driven  Jeep Classic WillysKaiserAMC preindependent
suspension and Power Wagons Slant 6 in a crewcab pickup

Actually Ive heard that some M1 Abrams tank commanders take the 
governers off their turbine engines and can acheive 90MPH on a
paved road  Never seen it myself but I believe it

werent exactly congenial at highway speeds and I wouldnt
swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi
