Since the wheeltire is balanced off the car ie the lugnuts are
not normally involved how would they do that I would think that
since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight
difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would
not have any noticable effect on the balance I could be wrong it is
