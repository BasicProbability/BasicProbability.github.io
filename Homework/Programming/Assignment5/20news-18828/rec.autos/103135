First off the correct spelling of Nissans luxury automobile division
is Infiniti not Infinity

who cares about typos of these meaningless synthetic names  if the
cars were named after a person eg honda id be more respectful

Lexus
  GS300 V6
  ES300 V6
  SC300 V6

wrong  the GS300 and SC300 use straight sixes while the ES300 uses a
V6  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a V6 and inline
6 in its lineup but that wont last for long
