 I just have got to remind all of you that this is it  Yes
 thats right somtime this fall Ford the granddaddy of cars
 will be introducing an allnew megacool
 waytoofastforAccorddrivers Mustang  Its supposed to be
 100 streamlined looking similar to the Mach III concept car
 Ford came out with around January  I cant wait  Anyone out
 there hear anything about it recently

Yeah it looks like shit  Nothing like the mach III Check out the
latest issue of popular mechanics they have a picture of one  It looks
like a cross between a dodge daytona and an eagle talon only much uglier 
This car looks like it should have been produced in 1990 not 1994

Ill pick up that PM and have a look  maybe the picture in there is not
the actual car but a prototype

I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed  it looked WAY too
Japanese for me the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX

Glad I didnt hold out for the 94 and bought a 93  Maybe theyll work on
the design a little bit listen to consumers and come out with nicelooking
95 or 96  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design
eg the Fbody CamaroFirebirds btw the new Camaros look like shit too
