Subject VASCAR

I know this is the wrong place to post this but I couldnt find any
relevant newsgroups in my area

For those of you who are from PA where is VASCAR where the cops
measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
between two white lines on the road right most commonly used  Im
especially interested in the Pittsburgh area specific locations prior
experiences if possible  For those PA and nonPA if they use VASCAR
in your state is it most common in rural city highway areas etc 
What Im interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk
of being caught  You can always detect radar but theres no way to
fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are

Thanks a lot
