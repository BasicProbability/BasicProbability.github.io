Subject Re Best Radar Detector  VALENTINE1

Ive had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det
ector available The point here is trust and reliability Ive been able to tr
ust the Valentine more than any other detector Ive owend If the Valentine sa
ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me then its mo
re than likely to be a speed trap With my other detectors Ive gotten so many
 falses that Ive begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didnt want t
o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal

That directional indicator really really helps Plus more info is almost alwa
ys better than less info No matter how smart radar detectors get the human br
ain is usually smarter So if Im going to make a decisio based on information
 at hand I want all the info I can get Plus if you divide the overall streng
th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported youll find that each
bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat With other detectors yo
ull just get one strong warning My logic may be faulty on this but I think i
t works okay

Although I must admit that I havent really noticed the reflection problem of
one radar souce
