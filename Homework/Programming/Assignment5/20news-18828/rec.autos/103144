 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they
                                                  
 would be safe at 5565 Roads like the Autobahn are smoother straiter
 wider and slightly banked 
 
 	Well thats news  Before 1975 the speed limit on Texas highways
 was 75  The speed limit on the New Jersey Turnpike I95 was 70  There
 were no speed limits in Nevada or Montana
 
 I guess I wasnt clear enough here I said the roads WERE designed for 
 speeds of 80 or so and still be safe The current 5565 will add a saftey
 margin
 
 
 Actually the roads were designated as safe at 80 when they were built
 in the 1950s taking into account the kinds of cars then available The
 number would be much higher today because the cars tires and just about
 everything else has imprivoved a lot

Except the drivers
