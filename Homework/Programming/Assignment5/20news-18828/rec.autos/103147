On the subject of the V4Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in
their Ford Transit vansThis brings back a memory from the seventiesI
played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of
us bought a 1967 tranny to cart the gear around inIt was in terrible
shape cosmetically because its last owner was a pig farmerWe spent
days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but til
the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
pig shit came flying out the vents
    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that
thing could haulwe could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and
it went like a bat out of hellof course there were no pollution controls
on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now
    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
Morris Minor that worked great Ah fond memories

Saab Sonnet III too I believe
