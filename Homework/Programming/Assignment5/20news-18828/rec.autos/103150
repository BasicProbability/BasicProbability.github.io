  my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car

I was about to recommend you consider a targa top over a convertible but 
DREW made the point very well  When my wife and I were in our 20s we
did the convertible thing with Triumphs  Now in our mid40s we still
appreciate the open air but prefer targa types  There is much less wind
noise objectspapers blowing around foreign objects getting into the
car and one still has almost all the advantages of the convertible  


My last car had TTops BIG TTops  My current car is a convertible
IMHO if youre after that convertible feel TTops opentop
sunroofs moonroofs whatever just dont cut it  Theres no
substitute for a convertible  If youre not after that sun beating
down on you the wind in your hair and teeth the flopsum and
jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the
whooshing of the wind youre not after that convertible feel
So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but dont call
it a convertible

And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar in a rollover situation  Of course Id rather not test it
in MY car  I too am in my early 40s

A convertibleaccept no substitute
