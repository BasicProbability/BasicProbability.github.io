Subject Re wife wants convertible

And heres my two cents

The best convertible for the money IMO is the Miata Yes its small but
youre buying it as a second car I hope so you dont need the cargo room
of a big car Its got enough power for fun its RWD like a sports car
ought to be Im gonna regret that  and the top while manual operates
like a dream 30 seconds and one hand to lower and not much longer to raise

The targatype cars are nice but theyre not real convertibles
