 To wheelspin in an auto you keep the gear in N  gas it  then stick the 
 gear in D Ive never tried this but am sure it works  but does this screw 
 up the autobox Were having a bit of a debate about it here

Ive known more people to leave their rear ends in pieces doing this 
especially if they have reasonable power to transmit and good traction
on the road surface

Youre better off powerbraking
