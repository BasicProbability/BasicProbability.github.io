If you put a locking lugnut on your tires do you need to have your
tires rebalanced

Well it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have  My previous
car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 25oz more than the others 
The locking lugnuts were factory equipment and according to the factory
service manual after tire balancing the technicianmechanic was
supposed to put a 12 oz counterweight on the rim opposite the locking
nut  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no
one ever did the service correctly I eventually got rid of the locking
lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts  Unfortunately I
found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid
of the locking nuts 

My present car a Saturn SC has locking lugnuts that I bought at the
dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn  They have been made to
be exactly the same weight as the nonlocking lugnuts said so on the
package and I verified it myself  I havent had any vibration problems
with the tires at all due to the nuts in 12000 of ownership  I did
have some other vibration problems but it was due to a poor job of tire
balancing
