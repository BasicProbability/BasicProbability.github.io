Subject SOME TAURUS MISC MAINT

 4 Are there any fairly cheap 150 or so ways to increase the
 performance on this car Unfortunately a Taurus is not exactly a
 muscle car so Im looking for ways to increase the performance

There is a company in Florida that sells computer chips that supposedly
get a few HP and Torque out of the 30 Dont have the address but saw
the ad in Hot Rod and some other car magazines Also you could open up
the exhaust get an exhaust with a larger id

Hope this helps If you find anything else let me know Ive got a 1990
Taurus L
