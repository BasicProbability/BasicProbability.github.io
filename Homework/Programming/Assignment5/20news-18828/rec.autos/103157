 Shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause
 transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade
 something for the trans in my 87  Pulsar SE it was  about 35k miles but
 it had a weak  tranny in the first place

Please explain the why of this I have over 200k miles usage of clutchless
