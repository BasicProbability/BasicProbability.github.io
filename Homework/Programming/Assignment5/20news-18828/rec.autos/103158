Subject Re Mercury Villager Minivan  good buy


	The VillagerQuest seem like the best of the CravanVoyager
	copies to come along since the Mazda MPV

Ill agree about villager but not MPV  its so small that Id class
it as a SUV with an extra seat shoehorned in  To get any rear cargo
space you shove the back seat up against the middle seat eliminating
all leg room

Back to the Villager 

	Only the price is controversial

And the use of attack belts instead of 3point belts  That killed it
for me
