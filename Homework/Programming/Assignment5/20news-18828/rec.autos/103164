Subject Re RFI Art of clutchless shifting

 Im not familiar with the trannies used in Winston Cup but in the transam
 cars Ive played with the  transmissions were the racing variety with
 dog clutches instead of sychros  In a transmission with dog clutches the
 gears are always  engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches
 engages the gears to the shafts  Motorcycle transmissions are the same way
 Shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause
 transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade
 something for the trans in my 87  Pulsar SE it was  about 35k miles but
 it had a weak  tranny in the first place
 
 just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro
 transmission  What you described SOUNDS the same to me  In fact what little
 ive studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs
 and said they were synonymous  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
 gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting Or at least
 that is what i was taught  Explain por favour

Motorcycle transmissions dont have synchros  The engagment dogs are very
corse and sloppy  There are maybe 610 teeth dogs on the side of the
gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back
and forth  To shift  start to apply pressure at the same time the
clutch is pulled the clutch is a hand lever and shift quickly  If 
you try a slow lazy shift it will grind you just have to pop it into
the next gear before it has a chance to grind  There isnt a neutral
between gears obviously there is but you cant select it with the
shifter so double clutching is not a possibility  speed shifting
which is what I have always heard clutchless shifting called works
pretty well for upshifts with some practice but I usually use the
clutchespecially for the lower gears

I think auto as in automobile trannys are similar except that the
engagment dogs are very fine with no slop  And the addition of
syncho rings  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions
that are synchronized but may not be in nonsynchro gears reverse
and sometimes first
