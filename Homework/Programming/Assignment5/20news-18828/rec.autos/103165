 The VillagerQuest seem like the best of the CravanVoyager copies to
 come along since the Mazda MPV  The NISSAN MAXIMA engine paired with
 the MAXIMA 4 speed Auto Trans should be an excellent drive train and
 the rest of the vehicle seems well engineered  Only the price is
 controversial
 
 Hmm  The last time I checked VillagerQuest does not have a Maxima
 engine and is very much under powered for its weight
 
Same engine different state of tune less hp and maybe more torque My
friend at work regularly takes 6 people in his and it seems to haul around
just fine
