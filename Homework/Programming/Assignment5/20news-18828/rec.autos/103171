 Cup holders driving is an importantant enough undertaking
 Ashtrays smokers seem to think its just fine to use the road

	Oh sure  sorry but the absence of a cupholder is not gonna
discourage anyone from eatingdrinking in the car  lets just put one
in anyway so at least they dont have the further distraction of trying
not to spill it
	Furthermore you are obviously not a smoker on a cold day it
takes a certain skill to toss a butt out of a cracked window without having
it winddeflect into the back seat  Also just cause some smokers use
the window doesnt mean all of us do
	This reminds me of one pleasant feature in the otherwise
ergonomicallyhellish interior of the Alfa Romeo Milano  you could ash
your cigarette without even removing your hand from the wheel the tray
was rightthere

 Fake convertible roofs and vinyl roofs
 Any gold trim

	These I will agree are abominations right along with the fake
continental sparetire kit  its sad watching those little old ladies 
try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tiremedallion
in the way
	Most pitiful fake convertible top on a Cadillac Cimarron with
all the chrome door trim still visible  not fooling anyone
Of course there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw
