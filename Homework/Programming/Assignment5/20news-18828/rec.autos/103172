 8 Saab 900  ignition is on floor

	Actually this started as a great idea  Before steeringcolumn
locks became popular Saab installed a gearshift lock  put the car
in reverse remove the key and the car stays in reverse
	Also suppose you get into your car and a thug comes up and
demands your keys at gunpoint  You hand them over he gets in and
HAS NO IDEA WHERE TO PUT THE KEY  At this he will run away or perhaps
shoot you anyway    I heard this actually happened somewhere
	Btw I hear that the Saab 900s new successor will have the
ignition on the console between the seats where it belongs
