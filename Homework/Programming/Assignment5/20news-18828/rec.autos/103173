 You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in
 place of the bolt  I have one on both of my cars  There have been no
 leaks in 210000 miles combined miles on both cars
 
 Yes but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot
 
 all they have to do is reach underneath turn a valve and forget the trip 
 home
 But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them
 
 I personally recommend installing a special locking drain plug to keep
 vandals away

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut It works great 
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that its just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles
Works for me I must say 


Either Ive just fallen for this or you guys
are really paranoid

Youre actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil

Cmon you think a vandalll do that

Thats absolutely ridiculous

Besides how hard is it to get under the car to 
change the oil

I can say from experience on the cars that Ive driven and
changed the oil on my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain but
once youve done it once you dont forget how and it
gets easier

I cant imagine any other cars are much worse than mine

 
Andy Infante   You can listen to what everybody says but the fact remains
