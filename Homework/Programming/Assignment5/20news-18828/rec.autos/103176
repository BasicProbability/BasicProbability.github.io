     Chances are that this has been discussed to death already and
if so could someone who has kept the discussion mail me or direct me 
to an archive site Basically
I am just wondering if Slick 50 really does all it says that it does
And also is there any data to support the claim  Thanks for any info

Mike Davis

I dont have any written data but I know what I have experienced  I use  
S50 in everything including my lawnmowers  In my car it smoothed the idle
and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees  I havent used it long enough 
to test for wear but some people I know have   
 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year  Since he has been using S50
he has went 5 years without an overhaul

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time  These coustomers
had ran S50 since almost new  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of 30K miles not 200K

In my opinion it works
