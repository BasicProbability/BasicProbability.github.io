How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children seniors the homeless

Hear hear  Thanks Robbie

You also dont read that much about violence against teenagers such as
George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17yearolds
who were trying to surrender with bulldozers


On the other hand I think it is true without singling out teenagers
for blame that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be
Those of us whod like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
with people of all ages

Well this isnt the right group for this but I have to say that I dont
think violence is any more socially acceptable now by any means  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistoltoting gunslingers as 
heros or even gangland thugs being considered romantic  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians  I dont think so  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then in fact
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California we here 
about it in MA the same day  Back in the old days theyd never hear 
about something like that period 

Yeah People act really shocked about violence as though it were new
to our species

What about the holocaust The crusades The Salem witch trials The
religious persecutions of the middleages 

What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
the world What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans
The Jews persecuted by Christians

There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been I do not
know the stats but there are far more people on the planet than there
were 2 or 3 hundred years ago The per capita acts of violence are
probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
thousand years ago

There is nothing new about violence
