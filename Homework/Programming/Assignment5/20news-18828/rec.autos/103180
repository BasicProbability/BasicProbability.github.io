ADVICE on SATURN EXTENDED WARRANTY


  I placed an order for a Saturn SL2 and it is expected next week The
Saturn retailer gave me some pamphlets about the extended warranty plan
and I have been thinking about it Being a first time new car buyer I am
seeking advice from veterans esp those who have bought Saturns lately
FYI I have listed some of the features of the Saturn extended warranty plan
The car comes with a 3 years36000 mile bumpertobumper warranty

Plan I

Extended Powertrain Coverage

Covers the cost of repairs to
   Engine
   Transaxle
   Front wheel drive
 24 hour roadside assistance program

Coverage Term yearsmiles

Deductible     560000     675000     6100000
               
50            375          550         725


i say extended warranties are a ripoff highprofit item for dealers
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
560k 675k 6100k  you get 3yr36k free  so what you are buying is
224k 339k 364k  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs coverage
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warrantywhy  designmanufacturing defects that the company owns up
to keeping customer happy etc
