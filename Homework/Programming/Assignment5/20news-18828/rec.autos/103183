I agree with Gaia Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car
so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind

this is an interesting point  some people are not really buying the coverage
they are buying peace of mind marketing folks love selling that  i suggest
that people choose to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than
buying that peace of mind

In my opinion getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough In my case thats be
cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors
 etc I could do myself I just didnt want to mess with the engine and such

youd be surprised how much the little knickknack stuff can cost  what if 
your ac goes out  steering rack  dont get me wrongim against all
extended warrantiesthey are a ripoff

Plus I think the extra 3 years of 24hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so
meting I opted for the 5 year plan for 375
extra 3 yrs  you realize the first 3yr36k is free warranty that comes with 
the car
