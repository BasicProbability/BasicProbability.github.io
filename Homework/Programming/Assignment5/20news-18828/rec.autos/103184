Subject Re Ad said Nissan Altima best seller

In article 1r0vk6INNaftcronkiteCentralSunCOM dbernardclesunCentralSunCOM writes
I too was puzzled by this obvious untruth What I think is going on is that
Nissan claims that the Altima is the best selling new car namelplate in
the US I think I have this near verbatim Lee Iaccocas statistics
dept would have been proud of that sentence

Note that the CorollaPrism are also new designs but hey are not new 
nameplates  I guess Nissan doesnt even sell as many Altimas as
Toyota does Corollas or there would be no nameplate qualifier

But waiiiiiit isnt Nissan officially registering the car as far as
government paperwork goes Nissan Stanza Altima to avoid costly and
lengthy paperwork I read this on the net a while ago and someone
actually may have said theres a little Stanza logo on the Altima
somewhere

You can have it both ways
