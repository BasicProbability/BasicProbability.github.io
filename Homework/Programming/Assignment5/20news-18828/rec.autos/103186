 How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
 agencies to help children seniors the homeless
 
 Hear hear  Thanks Robbie
 
 You also dont read that much about violence against teenagers such as
 George Bush burying alive tens of thousands of unarmed Iraqi 17yearolds
 who were trying to surrender with bulldozers
 
 
 On the other hand I think it is true without singling out teenagers
 for blame that violence is more socially acceptable than it used to be
 Those of us whod like to discourage violence have plenty of work to do
 with people of all ages

I didnt know George could drive a bulldozer
