I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls arent common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are
lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me

Get into an 30 mph accident and you may reconsider Ive been in one
and it is really scarey My life is something I value more
than a cars looks or handeling Consider it insurance it may not
happen often but when it does youll sure be glad you got a safe car

Granted the tests arent perfect but Id much rather be in a car that
did well in the test than a car that did horribly 

You raise a valid point but again its a tradeoff  how much money
do you want to spend for that kind of protection  You could buy a
Volvo Saab or Benz and get really good crash protection and other
luxuries but youll pay significantly more for it  In my case its
out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget

Even in highspeed headon collisions the most beneficial item you can
have is a good old 3point seatbelt  Nowadays at least in the US
you get an airbag if you get a 3point belt so presumably you get an
added safety benefit there as well  Thats something I certainly look
for and which can be had in inexpensive cars

My 02 of course
