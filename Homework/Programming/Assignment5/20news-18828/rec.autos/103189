There is no question that the Valentine1 299 has good range but
not significant enough to be 2 or 3 times as expensive as some of the
others

The big win with the V1 is not its range but rather its
directionality and multipletransmitter tracking which you later
called a gimmick  a conclusion I disagree with  Since the
detector incorporates multiple receivers its not surprising that its
significantly more expensive  While the added capabilities may not
help you there is added value for those of us who live in areas where
there are a lot of falsealarms

Summary Valentine1 way too expensive and not a significantly better
performer

I certainly call it interesting but Im another person who thinks
that the added value might be coming at too high a cost  Very
adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and
one of them has suited me rather well  If I did more longdistance
travelling in areas Im not familiar with Id probably consider
getting the V1 because its additional information would be useful in
discriminating false alarms
