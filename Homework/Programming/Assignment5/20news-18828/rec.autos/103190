 Fake convertible roofs and vinyl roofs
 Any gold trim

	These I will agree are abominations right along with the fake
continental sparetire kit  its sad watching those little old ladies
try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tiremedallion
in the way
	Most pitiful fake convertible top on a Cadillac Cimarron with
all the chrome door trim still visible  not fooling anyone
Of course there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw

	I have seen a cutlass Supreme coupe GM10 with a vinyl roof ditto
a Taurus  Shoot the owners NOW before its too late

    It gets better  Ive seen them on a 4door escort Chevy S10
Blazer and even a Chevy astro minivan  A minivan w a fake
convertible top is not something you want to see just after eating
 

	And better yetTheres a chevette in town with wire crome wheels
vinyl roof tacky paint job and a continental spare showing the wire
crome wheel within of courseIm scared to look on the inside and have
only seen it rolling down the roadand I too was glad I hadnt just ate
