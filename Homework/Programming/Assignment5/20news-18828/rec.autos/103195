Subject Production Hold on 93 FirebirdCamaro w 6Speed

After a tip from Gary Crum crumfcomccutahedu I got on the Phone
with Pontiac Systems or Pontaic Customer Service or whatever and
inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and
Trans Am  BTW Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me
nowhere  After being routed to a Firebird Specialist I was able
to confirm that this is in fact the case

At first there was some problem with the 323 performance axle ratio
She wouldnt go into any details so I dont know if there were some
shipped that had problems or if production was held up because they
simply didnt have the proper parts from the supplier  As I say she
was pretty vague on that so if anyone else knows anything about this
feel free to respond  Supposedly this problem is now solved

Second there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
to the sixspeed Manual transmission  So as of this posting there is
a production hold on these cars  She claimed part of the delay was
not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car and therefore
having to wait for the right high quality parts  Im not positive
that this applies to the Camaro as well but Im guessing it would

Can anyone else shed some light on this
