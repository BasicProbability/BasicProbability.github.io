Youre actually worried about somebody stealing
your oil

Ahhh yes Andrew we meet again

no not stealing the oil just draining it as to leave me stranded

Cmon you think a vandalll do that

Let me guess youre from Hudson Ohio

Thats absolutely ridiculous

Get out and see the world


IF I were the vandal and I really hated someone maybe someone who knew
something about cars of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could
undo  Especially special oil drain plugs and radiator petcocks

As well as putting bad things in the gas

While I would never vandalize someones car IF I were to it would probably
be the time bomb approach and Im sure Im not the only one who thinks
that way
