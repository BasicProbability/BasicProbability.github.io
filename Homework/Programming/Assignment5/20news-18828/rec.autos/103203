Subject Re water in trunk of 89 Probe

Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friends 89 Ford Probe  Every
once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually happens
after a good thunder storm  A few Qs
 
1 Is this a common problem
2 Where are the drain holes located for the hatch
 

I had the same problem in my 90 MX6 Luckily I had it fixed
under warranty I think they replaced a tail light gasket
Check with a dealer its a known problem
