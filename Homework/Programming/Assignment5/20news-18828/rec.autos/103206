But why not turn the question around why are automatics so common in
the US

Because some people like them and some people actually need them

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torquerich
V8s in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress and that this has just lived on

Yeah right Real muscle cars had a manual transmission and their
clutches arent that heavy ShelbyAmerican used plenty of
highpowered hightorque engines and Carroll only put autos in
his cars because people wanted them Blasphemers Heretics
Burn them burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto 
Real Cobras and they were the ultimate sports car at the
time had bigblock Fords which turned out prodigious amounts
of power and torque and none of them had automatics 

And also an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive

Yeah if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve fun 

I personally would love to have a 66 Galaxie 500 7Liter Coupe
with a firebreathing 427 and fouronnafloor to go along side
my 66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a firebreathing 390
with threeonnatree I love the sound of dual exhaust in the
morning  Theres no comparison between a REAL American
Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic IMHO
