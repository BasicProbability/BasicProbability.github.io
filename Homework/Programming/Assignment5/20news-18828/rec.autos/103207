 I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded
 magazine handy which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma For those
 times that Im travelling interstate I keep an unloaded 
 SW 44 Magnum revolver in the glove box with a speedloader

 in my pocket which is legal everywhere under Federal law Illinois
 State Police be hanged

Carrying a pistol loaded or unloaded in the glove compartment is
considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without
a concealed weapons permit  Unless the law has been changed recently
carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal
I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
traffic infraction and observed a 357 magnum revolver sitting on the
seat  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
because it was not concealed  The article stated that if the gun had
been discovered in the glove box it would have been considered a crime

Carrying in the glove box is not coveredIm not sure what I was 
thinking there It is legal in Oklahoma 

On interstate travel as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination the gun is carried
in a locked compartmentbox glove box specifically excluded separate
from the ammo it is legal under Title 19 Chapter 44 Section 949 I
forget and my copy of the regs is at home of the US Code This
unfortunately has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid under that states law

Gee and I thought Federal Law overrode state law
