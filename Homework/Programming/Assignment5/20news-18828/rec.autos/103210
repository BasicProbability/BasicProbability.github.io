Im looking for information on Opel cars  Now you ask which model
Well the sad truth is Im not entirely sure but its a twoseater
with rollover headlights hard top and really sporty looking  My
friend has one sitting in his yard in really nice condition
bodywise but he transmission has seized up on him so it hasnt run
for a while  Does anyone have any info on these cars  The engine
compartment looks really tight to work on but it is in fine shape and
I am quite interested in it
Thanks

        If it looks like a miniature corvette it would be an opel GTthe
    headlights are flipped over by pulling a lever inside
