	Are there any MR2 owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why
my MR2s engine sounds noisy The MR2s engine is noisy at the best of times 
but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises 

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2 the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline 4 that doesnt have balance shafts  i guess toyota
didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or
recommendation which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no
balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine  

if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V6

nice theory  too bad the MR2s never came with a four cylinder over 20
liters  More like 16  Or did they were the nonturbo MR2IIs  22 or
some such

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented designlike Porsches 30 I4
