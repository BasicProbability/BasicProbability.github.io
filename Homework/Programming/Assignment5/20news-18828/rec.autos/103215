If you put a locking lugnut on your tires do you need to have your
tires rebalanced

I bought a set of AREs a few months back and decided to add locks
so that I could keep my new rims I havent had a balance problem 
yet so I assume that it might be just particular to your type of
stock nuts My rims were balanced with new BFG TAs at a speed 
shop to the finest setting on their bal machine so that helps too
