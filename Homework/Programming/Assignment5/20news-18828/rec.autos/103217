Oh really  
Heres what you posted earlier in another thread  Before you thrash
others for making simple mistakes or flaunt your wonderful vi skill
think about how you make them feel as well as how you look you spelled

For years you have assaulted others with offensive language etc  From
the content of many of your posts you appear to have a lot of useful
information to share with people but it gets overshadowed when you come
across as an abusive smartass

highways
 was 75  The speed limit on the New Jersey Turnpike I95 was 70
