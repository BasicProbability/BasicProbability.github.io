 BMWs SUCK in the snow  I have aggressive snows plus a hundred
 pounds of sand in the back and I still try to avoid driving in the snow
 I happily took the SAAB through blizzard conditions without a worry
 I would say this is the single design flaw in the BMW

For a reasonable sum you can get a BMW with traction control
a torquesensing limited slip rear differential  Since no
FWD car including the Saab has this kind of front differential
since it would exacerbate torque steer a BMW with traction control
should have the theoretical advantage on snow  Of course weight
distribution and skinny tires could affect this
