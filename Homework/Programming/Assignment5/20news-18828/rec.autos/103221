Subject Re Choice of gauges


If Im going to drive on a public road then I need a
speedometer and an odometer helps for navigation
 
My 1965 Chevy has a bare minimum  Enginetemp and
Oilpress warning lights and a fuel gauge 

My 1983 VW has tach watertemp voltmeter 
and oiltemp gauges 
 
If I had a turbo car Id want a vacuum manifoldboost
gauge  An oil pressure gauge is a nice reassuring
gauge to look at  If my car was air cooled then I
would substitute a cylheadtemp gauge for the watertemp
gauge
 
A few years ago I looked at the Audi Quattro Si Coupe
that Bobby Unser used to win the 1986 Pikes Peak Hill Climb
The gauge layout from left to right top to bottom was
 

 
speedometer
 

 
fuel                  tranny
press                 temp
