For a reasonable sum you can get a BMW with traction control
a torquesensing limited slip rear differential  

traction control as far as the optional feature that one buys with
cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD but not all LSDs
are torque sensing  viscous coupled differentials as opposed to
viscous couplings are rotational sensing not torque sensing
for that matter so are traction control systems that use ABS
sensors and pulse braking

then there are the older positracs and whatever which i am not
familiar with the workings
