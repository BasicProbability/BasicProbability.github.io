Subject Re water in trunk of 89 Probe

Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friends 89 Ford Probe  Every
once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually happens
after a good thunder storm  A few Qs

1 Is this a common problem

Yes this is a common problem  The leaks occur through the seal of the 
taillights  Unfortunately Ford has this with Most Probes and does
not have a recall for it  Very dissatisfying to say the least

2 Where are the drain holes located for the hatch

There is no drain holes that I know of  I used a margine tub to drain it
Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldnt fix it
under warrantee  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system
including a balancemotion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
the trunk  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioningthey would
not retract  So I ended up paying about 200 to have the sensor replaced 
90 to have the tail lights resealed they firts replaced the hatch gasket
which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
when I proved to be right not to mention the water damage to the 
covers to the trunkspare com partment and algae in the taillights

very annoying  Dont let the water problem goget it fixed or youll pay
more later  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one
complains to Ford

Thanks for any info
Tom
