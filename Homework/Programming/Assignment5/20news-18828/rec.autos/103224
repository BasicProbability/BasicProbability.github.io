 Some comments
 
 a Good performance and mid and high speeds can be obtained by adjusting the
    top gear and final drive ratios Contrary to popular misperception a 
    number of Japanese cars have quite good performance from 70 in top
    gear 

No problem with that  The question is  do they perform consistently in all
conditions roads winds and curves at that speed and do so for hours on end 
year after year without giving the driver white knuckles  From my experience on 
the AutobahnsAutostrade a good touring car can be easily distinguished by its 
poise at 100mph  The best stay on cruise control at 155 for hours  Ive
seen the typical boy racer in a Fiat try to keep up  Sure they hit the century
mark but if the wind blows the wrong way they change lanes and if on an
overpass they may fly right into a guardrail  The buffeting at 125 can be
severe enough to  make the hood bend  Tires at 155 can melt and a pothole can
kill  Many German cars are designed for this environment even if they cant
seem to get out of their own way from a stop light Mercedes come to mind in
particular  And another design point is fuel economy at those speeds  The
Germans gear the car for very good high speed efficiency a typical MB 300E turns
1500 at 55 almost a stall 

Good point I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100 mph
nor do they reach 155 However using high to be 7090 mph

a They are quite amenable to long high speed drives Ive done several
1k mile trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever The last big trip
I made was driving from New York to Texas I remember driving 700800
miles a day at typically 7585 mph  without any problems Im sure I  
would have been more comfortable driving a benz but no white knuckles
No problems with winds and curves 

Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras  where
we were doing 80 all the way to Houston No problems

b Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds I see
no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph On the trip
back from New Orleans we got about 30 mpg in my Integra quite ok Mind
you the engine revs to almost 4k at 80 The civic is markedly better
than the Integra in fuel economy 50k miles down the road I still
get 35 mpg at 7075 mph driving


 b I cant understand why these highscale European marquees are afraid
    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in
    the low gears I have been doing that for that last 50k miles with
    my lowly Civic with no detriment to either the engine or the clutch
    and getting excellent mpg to boot Id call this an engineering hack
    to cover up design deficiencies

At 50k miles youd still be breakingin a highscale European marquee  They 
typically are designed to last 300000 miles per engine 500000 mi per
chassis The record is now over 1500000 miles on a Benz diesel and Ive
read about transmissions lasting 700000 miles  Speaking of

Now now you cant compare a diesel with a gasoline engine I see enough
bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100150k miles on them and advertise 
rebuilt engines If honda was to build an accord for 30k Id darn well
expect the sucker to last 300k miles

diesels they have very good efficiency at the cost of acceleration and are very
popular in all European cars diesel is considered the green fuel from the
smallest econoboxes to the luxobarges  Again we see a difference in mentality
Diesels in the US are considered slightly worse than useless and extremely
dirty to boot so you cant give them away

Ever got caught behind a early 80s 300SDL at a stop light Its not
pleasant The newer MBs are a lot better though The diesel Volvos
and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders

As for economy why should we care Gas is cheap I personally wouldnt
buy a diesel car for any reason  what does it buy me
