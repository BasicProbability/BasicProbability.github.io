I just ordered a Saturn SL1 after considering a few imports Frankly the Saturn

stuff deleted

Saturn also has a good extended warranty program 675 for 6 year60K miles 
fully refunded if you dont use it That works out to an actual cost of 170 or
so based on the 6 year treasury rates Using savings account rates its more
like 120 In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any
warranty work without counting against the refund

in general extended warranties are a ripoff  this 6yr60k is really only
3yr24k because you get the 3yr36k one free with the car  also is there
perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty
also are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty
and if you use it at year 4 for some 60 buck job and pay a 50 deduct and then
you have used it so no refund ever
again extended warranties are ripoff high profit items for the dealer
