Subject Re Toyota Land Cruiser worth it

My wife and I looked at and drove one last fall This was a 1992 model
It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered I could not imagine driving it in the
mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds I
have read that the new 1993 models have a newer improved hp engine 

Im quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said once
its broken in it will feel more powerful I had been used to driving a
Jeep 40L 190hp engine I believe the 92s Land Cruisers Land Yachts
were 30L the sames as the 4Runner which is also underpowered in my
own personal opinion 

They are big cars very roomy but nothing spectacular
