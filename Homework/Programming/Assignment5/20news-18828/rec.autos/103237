Subject Re Renting from Alamo

 cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than whats included in the base price But on the other hand he 
didnt rent it from Alamo

Probability that Ill be needing more insurance

Unless you have an accident you wont need more
