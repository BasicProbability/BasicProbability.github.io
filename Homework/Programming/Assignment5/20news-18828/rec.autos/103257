The VillagerQuest seem like the best of the CravanVoyager copies to
 come along since the Mazda MPV  The NISSAN MAXIMA engine paired with
the MAXIMA 4 speed Auto Trans should be an excellent drive train and
 the rest of the vehicle seems well engineered  Only the price is
controversial
 
 Hmm  The last time I checked VillagerQuest does not have a Maxima
 engine and is very much under powered for its weight

Yes it does come with the Maxima GXE engine mated to the Maxima SE
  transmission  And it has decent power for a minivan also  

  Check again
