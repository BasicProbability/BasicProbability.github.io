Subject Re Dealer cheated me with wrong odometer reading Need help

In article 1qvrnpINNnidshelleyuwashingtonedu yongjehardyuwashingtonedu Yong Je Lim writes
Here is a story  I bought a car about two weeks ago  I finally can
get hold of the previous owner of the car and got all maintanence
history of the car  In between 91 and 92 the instrument pannel 
of the car has been replaced and the odometer also has been reset
to zero  Therefore the true meter reading is the reading before
replacement plus current mileage  That shows 35000 mile difference
comparing to the mileage on the odometer disclosure from  The 
dealer never told me anything about that important story

I hope that I can return the car with full refund  Do u think this
is possible  Does anyone have similar experiences  Any comments
will be appreciated  Thanks

This is a tricky situation if the previous owner didnt inform
the dealer of the odometer change then the previous owner committed
fraud and he may be liable The dealer may also be liable If the
previous owner notified the dealer or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered  If a dealer changes the speedometer he has
to report it it goes into the cars service record with the manufacturer
and on the title if I remember correctly the dealer told me that
the old mileage etc were sent to Ford when my TBirds speedo 
was replaced If the odometer can be set to the old mileage it must 
be if it cant eg electricallydriven odometers then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle 

Either way if the change had been done legally then a records search
which the dealer almost certainly did should have turned it up
