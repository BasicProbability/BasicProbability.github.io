xtry to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tiremedallion
xin the way
x     Most pitiful fake convertible top on a Cadillac Cimarron with
xall the chrome door trim still visible  not fooling anyone
xOf course there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw

Least you think bad taste is something new
Back in the early 1970s I saw a couple of cars with flocked paint jobs
Thats not a typo I think they sprayed on some kind of glue then blew
on tiny pieces of nylon It comes out looking like felt Can you picture
a huge Plymouth Fury III in dark blue felt I think I can even remember
one guy who did it in red to a early 1960s Corvette That was after he had
turned it into a station wagon
