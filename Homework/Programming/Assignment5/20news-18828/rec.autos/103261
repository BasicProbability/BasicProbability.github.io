nice theory  too bad the MR2s never came with a four cylinder over 20
liters  More like 16  Or did they were the nonturbo MR2IIs  22 or
some such

let me clarify i think they both are 20 litres

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders must
pay SAAB a royalty for using their patented designlike Porsches 30 I4

i was already corrected on this and believe i may have been in errror that
it is actually MISTUBISHI 
apologies for butting into the thread
c ya
