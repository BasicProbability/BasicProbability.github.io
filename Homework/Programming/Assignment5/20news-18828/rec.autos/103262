Subject Re Fast idle on 88 Ford Ranger

It did it again  This morning my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10000 RPM
Ok so I exaggerated a little but it was idling very fast  It has a 2
liter carburated engine in it and no blipping of the throttle would
cause the idle to drop back to normal I dont think the linkage is stuck
What can I do to fix this problem  This has been a problem from time to
time but has straightened itself out  until now  I dont have a tach
but by gauging by the sound of the engine it is idling about twice as fast
as it should be  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up
at a stop light

Sometimes a bad choke pulloff diaphram will cause a car to fast idle The
pulloff which is vacuum actuated provides a necessary pull in noncold
weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam Locate the
fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
normal idle If so locate the diaphram and test it If you cant apply
suction via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose with your mouth that will
cause the diaphram to retract then its bad and should be replaced
