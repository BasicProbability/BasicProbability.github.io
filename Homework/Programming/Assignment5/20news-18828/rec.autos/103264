Hello

I find this method much better myself too although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face  After coming to which is
about 15 minutes later I change my clothes because by this time
all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck
down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil

Its just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekendI go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice

John

Not everyone should be trusted with tools
