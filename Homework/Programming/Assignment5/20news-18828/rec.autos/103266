I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls arent common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection but there are
lots of lowspeed collisions that do worry me

Get into an 30 mph accident and you may reconsider Ive been in one
and it is really scarey My life is something I value more
than a cars looks or handeling Consider it insurance it may not
happen often but when it does youll sure be glad you got a safe car

Granted the tests arent perfect but Id much rather be in a car that
did well in the test than a car that did horribly 

You raise a valid point but again its a tradeoff  how much money
do you want to spend for that kind of protection  You could buy a
Volvo Saab or Benz and get really good crash protection and other
luxuries but youll pay significantly more for it  In my case its
out of the question because all of those cars are beyond my budget

Ive been in two major auto accidents both were multiple car  The worst
was a headon three car collision T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go and I saw it
coming both times 

Even in highspeed headon collisions the most beneficial item you can
have is a good old 3point seatbelt  Nowadays at least in the US
you get an airbag if you get a 3point belt so presumably you get an
added safety benefit there as well  Thats something I certainly look
for and which can be had in inexpensive cars

If you really want to add safety to any car simply add a cage to the
car  They are available and cheap about 500 in the USA  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable  but instead of people spending a little
extra money we get legislation that says the govt must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone 

One other significant factor in improving ones own safety is to get some
training  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will  Driveride defensively and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average probably in the top 15th percentile in driving
ability but still we sometimes overlook the obvious  Ive been to two
driving schools and three riding schools for my motorcycle  A very
worthwhile investment and besides it was a lot of fun too  

Safety is what you make of it just because a carmaker doesnt provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesnt mean you have to leave it go at
that
