On a related note does this seem a sane price for a 67 convertible
Corvette in good condition How does one determine these things My CR
Used Car magazine doesnt list 67 corvettes  Any net wisdom on what 
to look forwhat to avoid Thanks in advance

Rich
	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet vetteschillercompaq
	com  during your searchacquisition of the 67  20k sounds about 
	right for a wrong engine condition 3 car  This means that the car may
	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver
	and or hobby car  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette
	Black Book immediately  Dont leave home to look at Vettes without it
	Since you are contemplating spending 20k you might want to invest a
	few hours in reading the Corvette Buyers Guide and purchase Noland
	Adams tape How to Buy a Corvette  The tape shows you how to check
	for damage etc  There are many many factors that will affect the
	value road worthiness and repair expense of your proposed 67  The
	list is much too long to go into here  Join the VetteNet where
	there are over 100 current Corvette owners many with 60s vintage
	vettes that are available to help you  The pubs I mentioned above
	are available from MidAmerica Designs 800 6375533 and several
	other Corvette parts sources  Good luck
