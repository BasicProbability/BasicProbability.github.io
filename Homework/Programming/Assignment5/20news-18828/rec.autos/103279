The Event

 The Joliet Mud Turtles a Chicago land four wheel drive club is
  sponsoring an OnOff Road Rally Sunday April 25th

 For those who ask What is an onoff road rally well

  An OnOff Road Rally consists of the following

   1 An ontheroad rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      JolietPlainfield area  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an offroad area where a fourwheel drive course is 
      setup  At various locations in the onroad course checkpoints
      will be setup where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity eg tire roll truck tow
      basketball freethrow etc for additional points

   2 An optional offroad four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate offroad trails mud bogs andor hill climbs
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating offroad obstacles
      without getting stuck  If you should get stuck which is half
      the fun anyway there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again  The offroad course will
      divided up based on tire size so stock 4x4s as well as modified
      4x4s can run the course
     
  At the end of the rally trophies will be awarded to top scoring
  participants  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out
  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion

 This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles
  so safety and fun is our foremost concern  All 4x4s must be
  street legal and have solid tow points for the offroad section
  of the course  we dont want to have to separate someones bumper
  from their vehicle
