 	Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for
 R12  You dont hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning  
Society
 MACS that is the people who stand to rake in that 300 to 1000 per
 retrofit per automobile have mounted an organized campaign to squash  
those
 R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether on very  
shaky
 technical grounds at best on outright lies at worst
  

Now Im not saying youre wrong because I know that the R12 substitutes  
exist but this sounds a lot like the 200mpg carbs that the oil companies  
keep us all from getting

These substitutes exist and at this time are available Its the future
availability that is in doubt

2 butanepropane  

You can mix this yourself so no one can ever regulate it away
Just make sure you use good quality dry gases


I dont know of any 200mpg carb distributors
