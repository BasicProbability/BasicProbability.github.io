I recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new Camry not mine
but it caught my interest and a new 626  It seems to replace the
factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing  I
have seen them on quite a few cars but I cant find anything more about
them in previous rac articles nor in ra articles

Id like to know all I can so any feedback is greatly appreciated
