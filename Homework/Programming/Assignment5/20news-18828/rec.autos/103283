Compare either to the Porsche 911 and you tell me which was designed
to go fast

you have a point about the brakes especially seeing as how the
mustang doesnt even have disc brakes in the back  
but there are significant differences between the latest 911s and
the late 80s 911s not the least of which is handling  im not
          

I think you mean late 60s  The biggest change that Porsche undertook to
alter the tailhappieness of their baby was way back in August 1968 for the
69 model year when they stretched the wheelbase  Besides some people
actually KNOW how to take advantage of oversteer and enjoy it

in europe  the 911 got low marks for high speed handling though to
be fair they might have been comparing it to the vettes handling
                                                   

what was that phil hill famous race car driver said about the
                

You should have seen what Phil Hill WORLD CHAMPION had to say about
the Vettes hes driven 

911 turbo  you cant make a thoroughbred out of a pig but you can
have an awful fast pig
           

Yeah that was what he said  

Paul Frere agreed  They both prefered the Porsche modified by Ruf to
either of the Vettes at that test
