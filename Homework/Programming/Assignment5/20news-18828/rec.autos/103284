I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all performancetype cars like the 50l
Mustangs Camaros and the like wed cut down on the number of
accidents each year Autos are fine for sedate little sedans
but they have no business in performance cars IMHO

I have to disagree with this  I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4speed auto
w overdrive and it is really better that way  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power  I live 
in the Dallas area and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to a manual would be
more fun  

I dont know if its as much an issue of their ablility to handle the
power as it is the power they lose in the torque converter etc

Safetywise an auto is less distractingI would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here
Performancewise I can hold my own against any stock 50 Mustang or 50
Camaro w a five speed  

However if you encounter a 93 Formula with 57L  6Speed Manual
Youll be SOL Im afraid  BTW I know of what I speak as a former
owner of a 57L Auto IROC 1989 and current owner of the
aforementioned car
