They light the highways in Texas  Funny everywhere else Ive been
they only light em at junctions

	And armadillo crossings

Texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such
wideopen spaces  It just aint so

	Well lets see in just my own personal experience theres
Nevada New Mexico Texas Wyoming Utah South Dakota Nebraska 
Minnesota Montana Florida and parts of Louisianna

	Nobody said Lets go into town and drive 130 on Main St
And you couldnt go that fast on the graveled washboard that passes
for highway in some parts  But that only really expensive cars should
be driven fast crap is well crap
