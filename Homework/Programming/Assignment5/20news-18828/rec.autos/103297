Ah we are looking for good people just like you We are a very concerned
group of citizens who are absolutely disgusted at the way that the majority
of drivers simply disobey traffic rules like going above the speed limit
passing on our right and riding our tails while all the while we respectfully
abide by the rules of this great country and maintain the mandated speed
limits with our calibrated certified cruise controls while keeping the
respectful 15 car length distance10 mph speed How many times have you been
ticked off by some moron who jumps ahead in the 55  15825 car lengths 
that you have left between you and the vehicle ahead of you while driving
55 mph Finally you have an option We are a totally member supported group
that perform functions for our own good for the good of this great country  but MOST of all for those unfortunate ones that are too stupid to realize it
bless their souls For a paltry 10 you can join Citizens for Rationally 
Advanced PilotingCRAP a nonprofit members only society But butbut

this exclusive club you must proof that you are able to be in the fast lane of
the busiest interstate in your area keep the correct 15 car lenth10 mph speedand I know this can be difficult with those morons around NOT let anybody pass
