I just have got to remind all of you that this is it  Yes
thats right somtime this fall Ford the granddaddy of cars
will be introducing an allnew megacool
waytoofastforAccorddrivers Mustang  Its supposed to be
100 streamlined looking similar to the Mach III concept car
Ford came out with around January  I cant wait  Anyone out
there hear anything about it recently

If everything Ive read is correct Ford is doing nothing but re
skinning the existing Mustang with MINOR suspension modifications
And the pictures Ive seen indicate they didnt do a very good job
of it
The new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a 20 year old car

gee is it 1999 already
Yes it will still be on the fox program chasis anything that will be differe
nt on the new car as far as mechanicals is unknown The suspension will most
likely be changed as well as the drive drain From what has been printed on
it there is no clear idea of what will be done as some say it will have
the modular V8 and others the current small block just have to wait and see
Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good a return to tradition
C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a 65 or 66 fastback

You know Im a Ford fan I must say so Im looking forward to the next
Mustang  I have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable
than the Camaro is now  You know thats MHO  

The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality
just the philosophy  It used to be quality and philosophy  GM is
barely catching up but they have more room for improvement that
can only be made up in time  STSs still come off the assembly line
with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunkdoorhoodpanel alignments
its those 75 year old plants  And the latest GM products still come
with the standard equipment RattleDash tm  But like I said theyre
getting better and making the move in the right direction

They beat Ford to the market with the CamaroFirebird but really only
in words  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
end of the year keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there  I wouldnt
press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it
Besides no bowtie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway

I do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even
Ford rep quotes  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in its entirety  Inside information had the
Taurus with a V8 and rearwheel drive at one point  I wouldnt look
for a simple repaneled Mustang folks you may be cheating yourself
if you do  Theres a lot of potential  Ford hasnt released a new
car without a 4wheel IS in 7 years  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least 4 right  A 4wheel IS could happen  Those
modular V8s are out there too  In the interest of CAFE and
competition dont rule those out either   Your ignorant if you do
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there
who really knows what itll look like  The Mach III  Doubt it
Highly

The next Mustang will be Fords highest profile car  It attracts
way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because its heritage
is more embedded in the general public  Dont lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that

I submit that the Mustang will be a success  Enough to elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here  You know
intelligent critical spews like The Mustang bites man  Some of
you are already beginning  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
will be comparable performers as usual  I predict that the
differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel as usual
The Camaro is still a huge automobile the Mustang will retain its
cabrearward styling and short ponycar wheelbase  The Camaro still
reaches out to the fighter pilot while the Mustang will appeal to
the driver  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set while
the Mustang will continue to sell to the collegedegreed muscle car set
Both will be more refined I do think the Camaro is  There will be
no clear winner

Unless the Ford gets the 32v 300hp Romeo  You dont seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only do you
