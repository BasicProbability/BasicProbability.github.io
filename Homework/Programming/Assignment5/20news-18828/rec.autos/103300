i think that it is technicaly known as a 180 degree vee configuration
could be wrongthis is how ive seen them referred to

    Then what is a Flat engine

flat  180 deg V  horizonatlly opposed

Usually it also equals boxer however I think the term is
traditionally reserved for 8s and 12s and firing order matters
This was talked about here in ra many months back I cant remember
the consensus

Examples

Ferraris 512TR is a flat 12 boxer
Porsches 911 is a flat 6
Subarus Impreza is a flat 4
