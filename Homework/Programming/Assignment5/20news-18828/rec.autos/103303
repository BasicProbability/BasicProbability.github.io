Subject Re Looking for Tips for Driving Cross Country

R Goldstein rdgworldstdcom sez
 As the subject says I am moving from Mass to Calif and will be driving
 mostly on Interstate 80
 Any advice from folks who have done it before

 Plan your gas stops in majorcity areas to avoid the 25 centpergallon
only gas station for 50 miles and youre an outoftowner surcharge

 Prepare your car  Dont forget things like your fuel  air filters  If
youre loading your car up consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat  In my xcountry trip a tire disintegrated in the
California desert  it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
the tire

 If you have a hatchback cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool as well as possibly avoiding theft

 McDonalds have good clean bathrooms

 invest in a 30 CB  magnetic roof antenna  It may help if youre stranded
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food etc

 Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
new state to catch all the speeders who have escaped the previous state

 Same as above when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
65mph rural interstate
