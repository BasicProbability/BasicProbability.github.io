Subject Weird problem with GM 4banger transmission

Im having an interesting problem with my girlfriends car  Before
I delve into its innards I thought Id check netwisdom on the
subject 

Its a 1985 Buick Skyhawk I knowI know
20l EFI 4banger
auto
35k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot especially at
highways speeds the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting stuck in 3rd gear  As a result when you stop for
a light the motor stalls  Putting the car in park and waiting
for 3060 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to reset and go back into 1st  Otherwise it just stalls when
put in drive  

My thoughts  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot not so likely or perhaps the lockup
converter is not disengaging properly seems likely  The least
likely keeping fingers crossed is that some critical vacuum
hose has brokencracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere as used to happen with old modulator valves

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from 1019 years of age  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want 

Id appreciate hearing any tipssuggestionsoffers of free
