Better still years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used
air It was called a Rovax The unit worked very well the short coming
was the seal technology Where is it today

Actually the company and the product was ROVAC  which stood for
ROTary Air Conditioningit used a rotary compressor with what
was effectively an airair heat exchanger and worked pretty well
The negatives were mostly that it was about 510 less efficient than
using freon and noise problems from the high velocitypressure air
all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt  It
is still a legal entity in Florida but I believe completely dead
and theres a heck of an opurtunity to buy up its patents and restart
the operation
