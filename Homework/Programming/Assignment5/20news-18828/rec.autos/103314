 Its nice to know that Im not alone out there when it comes to clutch etc
 problems on late model Hondas  If I get a few more supportive responses
 I will take them to my local Honda dealer or maybe send them to the regional
 rep in Southern Calif for their input on the problem  Maybe some group
 pressure from Honda owners can be placed on Honda to find a solution such
 as a retrofit of the clutch 
 
 Or maybe Ill just sell the blasted vehicle and go back to driving my 10
 year old pickup which was now fixed having clutch problems and caused me
 to look for what I thought would be a troublefree solution Ya sure Not
 to put down Honda or anything  the Accord has performed flawlessly in all
 other areas for its 16000 miles
 
 As it is said out of all this something will develop
 
 Later folks

Not alone at all My old 83 Accord now in the hands of a sibling has a much
better engagement of the clutch Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect Note that these are cars with 250000 kms and
140000 kms respectively My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1 and after three years and 67000
kms is no better Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection
