Examples

Ferraris 512TR is a flat 12 boxer
Porsches 911 is a flat 6
Subarus Impreza is a flat 4

i think you got it the other way round the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180
degree v12 and not a true boxer while the subaru and porsche are
true boxers  dont know about the vw bug though but i suspect that
it is also a true boxer
