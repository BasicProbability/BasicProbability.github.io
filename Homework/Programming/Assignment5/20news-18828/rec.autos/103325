 they are pretty much junk stay away from them  they will be replaced next
 year with all new models  


Junk  Theyve made the CD lists for years due to their excellent handling and  
acceleration  They have been around since about oh 85 or 86 so theyre not  
the newest on the lot and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class  
leader  You can get into a 30 L v6 141 hp Shadow for 1011K the I4  
turbo a bit more and a droptop for 1415K  


 As an exFleet Mgr of 3000 cars they were amoung the most trouble free of
all models  I bought one for my wife
