if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V6

Perhaps a nice used 88 Pontiac Fiero GT  28 liters

Does anyone know if the motor mounts for the 28 and the twindualcam 34
liter match  The 34 is supposedly derived from the pushrod 31 which was
a punched out 28 liter  Should be a dropin replacement eh  205 horses in
a midengine the size of a Fiero

Larry Smith smithctroncom  No I dont speak for Cabletron  Need you ask

Liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want
