 Id like to get some feedback on a car with most bang for the buck in the
 13000 to 16000 price range Im looking for a car with enough civility to be
 driven every day or even on long trips but when I hit the gas I want to fee
l

Take a look at a 91 Taurus SHO  they can be found for 13k and are the
ultimate in 4 door sports cars  Performance similar to a Mustang but
quite civil and comfortable  Try to get a late model 91 for the better
shifter

Well you could always go with a 50 Mustang LX with a pleasant V8 but the
diamond star cars TalonEclipseLaser put out 190 hp in the turbo models
and 195 hp in the AWD turbo models  These cars also have handling to match
the muscle and are civil in regular driving conditions rather than having a
harsh stiff rideThe AWD Turbo is clearly the better choice of the two
because of all that torque steer on the front drive model but you may have
to go with a leftover or slightly used model for that price rangetough
decision
