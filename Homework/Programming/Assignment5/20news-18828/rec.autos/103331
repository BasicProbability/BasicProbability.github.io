	Are there any MR2 owners or motorhead gurus out there that know why
my MR2s engine sounds noisy The MR2s engine is noisy at the best of times 
but not even a nice nose  its one of those very ugly noises 

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2 the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline 4 that doesnt have balance shafts  i guess toyota
didnt care about little details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling

myself i automatically cross out any car from consideration or
recommendation which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no
balance shafts  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine  

if the noise really bugs you there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V6

Eliot is right about 22 liter engine in the second and last generation
MR2s But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR2 If its a
first generation car like my 85 it has 16 liter engine or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger if its 87 89
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard
I dont know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise Not all that annoying mind you But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear
