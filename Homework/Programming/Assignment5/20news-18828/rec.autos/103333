On the subject of the upcoming new Mustang

I do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even
Ford rep quotes  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in its entirety  Inside information had the
Taurus with a V8 and rearwheel drive at one point  I wouldnt look
for a simple repaneled Mustang folks you may be cheating yourself
if you do  Theres a lot of potential  Ford hasnt released a new
car without a 4wheel IS in 7 years  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least 4 right  A 4wheel IS could happen  Those
modular V8s are out there too  In the interest of CAFE and
competition dont rule those out either   Your ignorant if you do
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there
who really knows what itll look like  The Mach III  Doubt it
Highly

The next Mustang will be Fords highest profile car  It attracts
way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because its heritage
is more embedded in the general public  Dont lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that


The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
Cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior
After the MN12 Thunderbird cost and weight debacle Ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive wont be tried again in 
a volume car  

The current 49l V8 will soldier on for about two years  A version of
the 32 valve modular V8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then  Ford
is spending big money tooling up for 25l and 35l V6 engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of 300 hp V8 engines a priority 

Undisguised the car looks OK but not nearly as exciting as the new
CamaroFirebird IMO  

I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will 
achieve with the Camaro Firebird  The way GM loses money the temptation
to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off
