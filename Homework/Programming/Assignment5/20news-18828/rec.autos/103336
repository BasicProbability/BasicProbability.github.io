 It was called a Bricklin

Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford

Waitaminnit didnt the Bricklin have an Pugeot sixcylinder  Or am I
confusing it with the DeLorean  I was sure the DeLorean had a v8

The Delorean used the PeugotRenaultVolvo V6 in a rear engine configuration
The Bricklin use some Merkin iron in a front enginerear drive configuration
