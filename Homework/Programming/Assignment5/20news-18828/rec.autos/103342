Subject Re WHAT car is this


You guys are correct  The Bricklin was produced in Canada
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one and sometimes they put it on display  Most of the time
it stays in storage because the museum doesnt have much room
Its a big deal for a car to be Canadian and thats why they 
have it  If anybodys a fan they also have a nice green 73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom
