Subject Auto WAX

Having recently purchased a 93 Probe with clearcoat paint I 
would like to give it a good wax job  What is the Best type of
wax to use for this type of finish  Is paste or liquid better
I would be waxing it by hand and buffing it by hand I guess
using cheesecloth to buff it anything better you would suggest

Ive heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax
and Raindance not being very good so Im wondering what is
recommended for a quality finish

Thanks in advance
Bill
