Can anyone offer any opinions of the Ford Probe ala how they do in
the long run repair records reliability mileage etc

Some other owners on the fordprobeworldstdcom mailing list have commented 
about this problem but I havent seen it happen on my 3 month old 
93 Probe GT  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars  Also someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer where I purchased
the car  the first time they made this problem worse  The second time
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my fordprobe mailing
list they said they didnt know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and
made it much better  However it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough
roads and still squeals when I openclose the window in wet weather anyone
elsess do this

Ford only gives 1 key with the car  Cmon Ford spend an extra few pennies

I got two keys with my car but only ONE remoteentry pushbutton thingie
But then I bought my 93 with 2500 miles and  I think it may have been a
repossession  so Im not surprised something was missing 

horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference

I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where
it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your Ford
that could  cause  serious injury  threaten lives  etc  Something
about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford  Those little
youvegottopositionthefingersperfectlytomakeitbeep buttons are
TERRIBLE

The latter is probably because of the air bag  Its pretty much takes up
all the space where youd expect to find the horn
Speaking of the horn I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind
The previous Probes had Japanese horns

Well I guess thats good in a way but in a way its bad  When someone
hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big American car  They may
not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the Probe is

Tires fling dirtmud onto side of car 
Yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes

The mudflaps help a lot

transmission the 5 speed is a must

I have always been a 5speed guy  Almost every car Ive ever owned has been
a 5speed  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles I
knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic  But it is a pretty
hightech automatic  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4speed with
torque converter lockup  Even with the automatic Im getting 35 mpg on the
highway driving 6570    but of course driving  65 is illegal so I 
probably made that sentence up       Around town the mileage has been
around 2527 not bad for an automatic   Of course it doesnt have the
control of a 5speed but since I do a lot of city driving it turns out
to be very convenient  Its nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in 
weliketocontrolyourlife Massachusetts 


No shakerattle noises when going over bumpspotholes still

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe  Ive gotten them to fix the
worst of them but I fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older

Tires 22555VR16 Goodyear Eagles 70 left hoping for 30K 

On my 89 Probe GL I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears
and had driven the replacement tires Bridgestone 50K miles when
I tradeed the car  The 1956560VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe
look like theyre designed for performance ie rather wide shallow
tread etc so they probably wont last as long  But the car handles
very very very well  It sticks to the road like glue even on a rough
surface

interior is very very nice too  Very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically
sound

Definitely  FordMazda did a very very nice job on this one  The
car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it

Yes this cars stiff suspension isnt for everyone  I personally like it
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car Id strongly
suggest looking into the MX6

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years I find the 93 suspension interesting
The car actually drives much better than the 89  it is a very firm
ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads  You Hear and
feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well

If you have 3 passengers by all means bring them along too  Theyll find
that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides
differently if thats better is up to you  

Well I wouldnt encourage passengercarrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports writeups consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf  No biggie to me though if it had been Id not
have bought the car  but its definitely not a family car

Also theres a lot of glass
around you which I wasnt expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer

AC is a MUST on any Probe from 89  93  The 93 in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX  That lots of glass you
mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you
see in all the writeups  Most sportssporty cars dont have that
good visibility

Ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine
I havent heard about this one  I know that some of the very early Probes
89 and maybe 90 had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which

The complaints Ive heard re exhaust system on 93s have been on 
the GT  Of course being a different engine that is a differeent 
exhaust system

I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement
Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice 
I wasam due a refund from Ford  I applied in February and am Still
waiting   

gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car  I was quite happy with the way they handledespecially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them

Yes  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touchup
adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy
for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though 

From what Ive heard it sounds like FordMazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe and probably MX6 when they first went into production but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point  Thats
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm  But I seriously
feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well
