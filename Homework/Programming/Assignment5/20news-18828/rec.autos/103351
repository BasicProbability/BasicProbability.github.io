 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they
                                                  
would be safe at 5565 Roads like the Autobahn are smoother straiter
wider and slightly banked 

	Well thats news  Before 1975 the speed limit on Texas highways
was 75  The speed limit on the New Jersey Turnpike I95 was 70  There
were no speed limits in Nevada or Montana

I guess I wasnt clear enough here I said the roads WERE designed for 
speeds of 80 or so and still be safe The current 5565 will add a saftey
margin

 
Actually the roads were designated as safe at 80 when they were built
in the 1950s taking into account the kinds of cars then available The
number would be much higher today because the cars tires and just about
everything else has imprivoved a lot
 
 
I believe the interstates were origionally funded as part of a national 
defense plan etc  The  requirements were to move heavy army trucks at 
70mph

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph 
on the same 3 to 4 lane road  Around Washington DC they cant keep traffic 
flowing at 55
