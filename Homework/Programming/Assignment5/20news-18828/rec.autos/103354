HELP
my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car
We live in South Fla so we are definitely in the right are for one
My wife has mentioned the Miata but I think it is too small
I would like to wait for the new Mustangs  Dec 93 I think
Anyone have any opinions on anyall convertibles in a reasonable price range

                                           Thanx

	The Olds Supreme Convertible got high marks in CDs recent test if
you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff  The Saab 900 ragtop may
be out of your range but its a good choice  Is there a new Fcar convertible
The Nissan 240SX convertible is a nice car also Those immediately come to 
mind
