Subject v 16


	Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925  
to 1935  They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  
the crimp on luxury cars  It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
power  They dont make them like they used to  
	There were others though  Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  
sized to their legendary TwinSix their mainstay for the next twenty years   
Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure
	Most luxury and semiluxury cars of this era at least experimented with  
V16 if they did not actually produce them  There was actually a cylinder war  
among the Big Three to see who could produce the biggest engine
