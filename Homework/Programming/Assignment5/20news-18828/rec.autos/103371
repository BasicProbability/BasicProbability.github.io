 Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friends 89 Ford Probe  Every
 once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
 under the plywoodcarpet cover on the trunk  I would guess this usually  
happens
 after a good thunder storm  A few Qs
 
 1 Is this a common problem
 2 Where are the drain holes located for the hatch

I noticed this is my 89 probe also when recently cleaning out the back  I  
think the water is coming up through some rubber stoppered holes beneath the  
spare  Mine looked slightly worn and there was no water or water damage above  
the level of the spare area 

I have the same problem with my 90 probe  The water is definitely not comming
up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare  I have to remove the
rubber stopper to drain the water  Seems like a common problem with probe
