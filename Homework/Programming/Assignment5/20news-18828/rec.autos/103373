Subject RE THE 1994 MUSTANG

 The current 49l V8 will soldier on for about two years  A version
 of the 32 valve modular V8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then

How unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and
351 Fords and 305 and 350 Chevys can be built up Still it will provide
a needed punch for the Ford to stay up with the new FirebirdCamaros It
wouldnt surprise me if Ford called the engine a 50 litre in the
Mustang We all know that the current 50 is really 49 litres anyway

 Undisguised the car looks OK but not nearly as exciting as the new
 CamaroFirebird IMO

I must agree I dont think Ive seen anything as impressive looking as
the new Firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 Formula 400
Firebird for a paltry 2000 without even telling me The bastard
