Subject BRONCOS

Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos Im
not talking about Bronco IIs Im referring to the Broncos that began
production in 1978 based on the F150 chassis I believe

I need to know what to look for can the tops be removed from all
models how easily can that be done Also what kind of price range
should I be looking at ie what is blue book Im in college right
now and would like a Jeep Unfortunately Ive got a bit of a ride to
school and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in
the springfall I think that the Bronco with the removable fiberglass
would be a better read bigger choice than a CJ5 or CJ7

Even better anybody in the MarylandVirginia area interested in selling
one
