I personally like the looks of the Impala SS  The Caprice was definately 
weird looking until this year when they made the rear wheel openings look 
more like a normal car but the Impala impresses me  GM cant exactly shove
the LT1 in everything they make you know only the bigger stuff  Id like
to see it next in a 1500 series pickup  That would be a hot setup
                     

What about in a full size Blazer as well  Would this engine have the gobs
of torque necessary for offroading  If so this would be even better than
the Syclone

Well an LT1 Blazer wouldnt come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed I think its
too heavy  As it is right now the normal 210HP 57 engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer  Of course Im not saying GM shouldnt put the
LT1 in it   It seems like they have a real winner with that engine  Why
spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take 
an LT1  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG for a 57 that is


talking about Impala SS
Will this be in the 4door Caprice body  Im just curious if Chevy is
trying to resurrect their 2door muscle cars or to compete with the European
super sedans

Yeah its a flat black lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17 aluminum rims and
Eagle GSC tires  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ read 
plush police package with 300 horsepower

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but thats going to get 
their 34 DOHC V6 and not the LT1
