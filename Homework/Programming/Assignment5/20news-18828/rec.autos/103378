 IMHO the dumbest thing we ever did in copying the Japanese was moving the
 dimmer switch from the floor to the lever controlling the turn signalcruise
 controlbun warmer etc

Well my 1973 Porsche had the dimmer on the turn signal stalk  Guess those
dumb Germans were copying the Japanese too 

rest deleted
  
 
Not to mention my friends 54 Citroen Traction Avant with the light switch and 
dimmer integrated in a single stalk off the steering column   Those dumb French
were apparently copying the Japanese before the Germans
