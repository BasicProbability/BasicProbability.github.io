Subject Re What is  Volvo

Hardly a good reason most US cars do too  and plenty of people
buy them in the US anyway  I think the 850 is quite a good
looking car  unlike the US influenced 740

I dont think its so easy to tell the 850 from any other 7 or 9 series unless
you look real close I really do think Volvos are all dogs though beacuse they
are 1Agricultural 

While previous Volvos have been essentially very fast tractors the 34 and 8 series
are far from agricultural in design or execution how many FWD tractors have you 
seen

2Have godlier than thou advertising 

You state this like it is a bad thing    remember car companies use
ad agencies  they dont do their own ads

3are part of Renault

Is this true  I know that they had done joint ventures with Renault but I havent
heard about their subsumption into Renault  does this mean that the French Government
now owns Volvo   anyway Renault makes some very nice cars they just dont sell
em in N America


However One thing that I do think is in their favour is that they are
immediately recognisable as a VOLVO and that is not something you can say
about most Japanese manufacturers and Ford Saab also have a strong corparate
look which like it or not is what I thing all car makers could aim for to
make life a little more varied
