Subject Re SHO and SC

In article C5L8rE28constellationecnuoknoredu callisonuokmaxecnuoknoredu James P Callison writes
Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me if you cant handle a stick you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers That is not to
say that there arent real drivers who cant use the stick eg
disabled persons but they arent in any position to use an
SHO anyway 

actually disabled persons have been known to drive in SCCA
races  id be careful about making sweeping generalizations here

id prefer a manual transmission but the early SHO had an
awful transmission that felt like it came out of a truck or something
it was almost enough to make me want an automatic
