The quality of autobahns is something of a myth The road surface
isnt much different to a typical TX freeway They are better
in terms of lighting safety signs roadmarkings etc

They light the highways in Texas  Funny everywhere else Ive been
they only light em at junctions

Sorry by they I meant autobahns not US freeways


I wont even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant

than most of the roads here A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130 Dont get me wrong I love to

It would have to be quite severe I dont recall any US freeway
without road damage warnings that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent well damped car

I suspect you have very limited experience  US freeways vary
dramatically particularly between states  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be
very optimistic in any car

Well Ive driven in every state but Alaska and drive about 60k per year
I take long cross country trips any chance I get  its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment
My job allows me to drive rather than fly Not to labor the point but
Ive driven just about every freewayin the US Germany UK and France plus
some in Mexico which was surpisingly good


Im not sure what you call quite severe in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be
considered so  Theyre hard to take at 85mph  Thats not the only
interstate Ive seen with such deviations but its one I drive
frequently

Yes but as a age of the total freeway in the US 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard advising people to
slow to 85 or so 


Texas is pretty much an edgecase  you cant assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition such flat terrain and such

Texas freeways are varied sometimes a good surface Mostly flat But
I5 in CA is comparable and hilly

wideopen spaces  It just aint so

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 eg 535 
most US freeways are just fine The problem is other road users and
cops
