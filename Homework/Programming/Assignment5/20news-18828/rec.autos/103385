stuff about Dodge Shadow deleted

 As an exFleet Mgr of 3000 cars they were amoung the most trouble free of
all models  I bought one for my wife

What do you mean by all models all models of cars all Chrysler models
all models that the fleet manager had bought Because there is no way in
hell that the Shadow is the most reliable car of all models sold not
even Chryslers dept of lies damned lies and statistics would claim that
