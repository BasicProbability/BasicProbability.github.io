Subject Question to Nissan 300ZX ownersgurus esp 8789 models


I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX nonturbo last year  I had a 
question on gearrpm ratios  Right now in 5th 65mph Im at 
26002700 rpms  70mph Im at about 2900rpms  Is this about the
norm  Im an auto neophyte so Im just wondering if these are
the proper ranges  Somehow the rpm figures seem high  A friend of mine
just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta 28l V6
Also anyone know the top speed attainable redline for this model Z
Not that I would try it but it would be an interesting factoid 
 
				Thanx
