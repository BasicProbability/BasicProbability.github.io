Im considering switching to Geico insurance but have heard that
they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim  I was
worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim  I have
also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident

Ive read in this group that Geico has funded the purchasing of radar
guns by police depts Im not sure where

	Maryland and other states

	To the original poster

	Read the last 34 issues of Car And Driver about this  Its 
interesting and should be illegal
