Subject Buick heater controls

I have a 71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it  I bought it in California and if
itll let me Id like to keep it for another year  The only problem is these
Indiana wintersmy heater controls dont work

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents  Right now it is
stuck in the vent mode  It will blow warm air but I cant switch the air
flow to either the floor I can live without this or the defrost I cant 
live without this  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position but this blows a lot of air in my face and is well
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem or part of it is with the two diaphragms which control updown
and outsideinside air flow  THe diaphragm which controls outsideventin
sideno vent air is cracked most of the way around and the other one is
probably damaged too considering the advanced age of the car

Two questions

	1  Is there anything I should be aware of about this other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana 

	2  In the event that replacement diaphragms arent available is there
	a way to fix this

THanks for any adviceinfo
