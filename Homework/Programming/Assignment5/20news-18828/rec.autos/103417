From article 1r1i7mINN4n4cronkiteciscocom by kmacciscocom Karl Elvis MacRae
 
 
 	I just read articals on this in Road and Track and Car and Driver
 	Is that one mag or two B and I was wondering if people out
 	there have any opinions that differed from what these mags have to
 	say
 
 
 	Im looking at the following three SUVs anyone whos driven all
 	three have any strong opinions
 
 
 	Ford Explorer
 	Toyota 4Runner
 	Nissan Pathfinder
 
 
 	Currently Im leaning toward the Toyota cause Ive had big success
 	with Toyota trucks in the past and cause I think its the best
 	looking of the three But I thought Id see if anyone has any strong 
 	opinions
 
 
 
 			Thanks

I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didnt fit plus it is the
highest cost of all the ones you mentioned I have good friends who have all
three of the trucks you talked about the ones with kids all went to the
ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk
you need The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan Every one has
been happy with what they bought Although no one is into serious four wheel
off road driving
