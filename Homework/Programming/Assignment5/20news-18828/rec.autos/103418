What about the rice import issue  Of course it is not closed up
like a shell  but how open is it compared to to US 

Japan is much more open than Korea

Yes  A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of 2 increase in price
when it is exported to Japan

However a Dodge vehicle the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned
suffers a factor of 4 increase in price when it is exported to Korea
A Ford Taurus suffers the same problem  A Honda Accord costsI am
not making this up48000 in Korea

Just how many people would want to buy a Honda Accord for 48000

Solution  All ships carrying Koreanmade vehicles should be returned
           to Seoul  Pronto  Until as such time as Korea decides
           that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade
           with the USA and Japan

Now now before we get too carried away here

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership last I heard there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate  Basically
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class  In exchange zaibatsus like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies perpetuating a vicious cycle
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society
of screwy components that wont work together  Stubborn like a mule the
car either wont go forward or wont stop at all
