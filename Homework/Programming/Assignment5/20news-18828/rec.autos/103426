Hi there
Ive recently been toying with the idea of purchasing an old 914 The going
rate seems to be about 4000 for cars with anywhere from 4080K Mi
My question is this what should I expect at this price Should I expect to
have extensive body work done What about engine  transmission should I
likewise expect to have both virtually replaced Along those lines
does anyone have the names  addresses of any mailorder parts
suppliers for everything from engine to body parts Im completely new
to the area of restoring cars and as I dont actually do any work with
cars most of the work would have to be professionally done what sould
I expect the cost of upgrading a 914 to a rustfree mechanically
sound automobile
Thanks in advance
Andre 



True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but Ill dump my impressions  Ive wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years
now came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead biggest mistake
of my life

Anyway for 4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit
The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment  Also look for chassis welded together
here  Oh yeah the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger
a 6 if you could find one would be mucho more bucks

Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by for an old car and you
can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too

The machine itself is pretty simple they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake so getting it fixed by a good
bugporsche mechanic would be easy  Since it is midengine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work
