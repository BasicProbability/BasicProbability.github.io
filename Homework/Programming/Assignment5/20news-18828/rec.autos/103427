The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard
I dont know the relevance of his observations about oil changes my simply
makes noise Not all that annoying mind you But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear 

i think those with 16 MR2s would describe the engine as sweet if a
little loud those with 22 MR2s i cant imagine any unbiased person
paying it any compliments  sounded like my exdormmates rusty chevy
chevette  with the 16 i would want to redline it just for the music
with the 22 i would short shift so that it would shut up  the new
camry 22 features balance shafts  i guess since the mr2 is getting
the axe it is too late for them to do anything about this

it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is only 2 liters the engineers
had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses  also in europe
the MR2 Mk2 nonturbo was also only 2 liters as usual the
undiscriminating american market if it is japanese it must be good
gets the dogs to be fair we also got the turbo which the europeans

Well the 16 IS music to my ears I often turn my stereo off and just run
it towards red line on nice twisty roads But Toyota engines at idle have
a strange bells and whisstles at the bottom of a matal can sound I cant
describe it any better
Just like all the older Benzes have a very characteristic clattering sound
at idle Do you know what Im referring to
