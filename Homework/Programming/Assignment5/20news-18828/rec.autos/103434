Im getting a car in the near future  Ive narrow it down to 300ZX and SC300
Which might be a better choice

Having driven both and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now all I can
say is it depends  Theyre both great cars  In fact my wife and I
are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year
The 300ZX handles like a dream while the SC300 rides like a dream
Fit and finish on both are excellent but the Lexus gets the nod in
customer satisfaction  Theyre both very attractive and hideously
expensive  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX  The
300ZX isnt available with traction control which makes it a handful
on slippery surfaces
