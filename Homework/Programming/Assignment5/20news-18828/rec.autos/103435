if you want to annoy geico call them upgive fake namebut real car 
specsget a quote and then tell them they are more expensive than your 
current state farmallstate insurance  they will still send you quote etc
then you can tear up their quote and stuff it in the prepaid return 
envelope and mail it back to them  actually they were 12 more than my current
state farm rates


Actually Ive had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage
junk mail in along with whatever else into anybodys prepaid envelopes
until they almost burst  I believe they pay postage by weight
heh heh heh

Anyways dont tear up the quotes just yetI sometimes use their
quotes or other insurance quotations as leverage to haggle for a
lower rate elsewhere  Usually it works to your advantage if 
they are lower
