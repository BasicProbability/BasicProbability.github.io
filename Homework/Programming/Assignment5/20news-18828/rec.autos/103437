 I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show and would like to hear
 your comments

 MILITECHtm is yet another oil additive But the demonstration of
 this product really impressive if it didnt cheat

  Well I heard that Militech stuff works pretty good too One of my
friends who races in SCCA sanctioned events and all that stuff got the
Militech stuff early as a trial thing and he put it in his CRX  He
says it worked great but I didnt ask him for any details
