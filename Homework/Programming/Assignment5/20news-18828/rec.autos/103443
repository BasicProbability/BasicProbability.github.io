  My 90 Integra was hit hard in the 325 hailstorm in Austin TX 
  The insurance company cut me a check for 6600 100 deductible
  last week  Is this a record Anybody else had settlements from
  the same hailstorm yet

 Rumor has it that a guy at Dell Computer had his Miata totalled so that would  
 be about 10k
 
 I guess it either had the top down or the hail ripped through the top as
 you could not do 10k worth of hail damage to a Miata body

There was a Volvo owner that had 3000 dollars worth of improvements to the 
looks of the car by hail
