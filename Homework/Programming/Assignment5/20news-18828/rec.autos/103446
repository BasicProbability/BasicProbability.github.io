As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
here in Europe they are rare Just wondering
 

Many cars sold here in Finland are small and cheap cars at least when
compared to other cars  note that we have over 120  car tax

And you couldnt expect a good auto mated to a 13 L engine

Most of the bigger cars are however sold with autos



I would guess the high price of gas in Europe compared to the US has
always favoured 4cylinder manuals

small engines with autos are a real bore

But why not turn the question around why are automatics so common in
the US

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torquerich
V8s in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress and that this has just lived on

And also an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive
