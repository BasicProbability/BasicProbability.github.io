Subject Compilation of problems


AWMy 85 Caprice Classic with 120K miles has finally reached
  the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
  I am forced to post   Anyone out there who might be
  able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below
  please email or post

AW1 When making turns especially when accelerating
  there is usually a loud thunk from the rear of
  of the car  Sounds like it could be the differential

Wheel bearing ujoint


AW2 On starting the car I get blue oil smoke from
  the exhaust for 510 seconds  Exhaust valves

Bad valve stem seals

AW3 Brakes  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
  with but master cylinder is full and fluid is

Worn pads rear brakes not adjusted up tight or worn out drums
90 of low pedal complaints usually are from a rear brake problem

AW4 Tranny  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
  worse  takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
  3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application and more
  recently it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd
  Fluid checked with car running with tranny put
  through all the gears and then back to park as per
  Haynes manual is red and clear and is on full mark
Possible modulator valve if equipped with one Also could be the
kickdoen cable

AW5 My springs all around are just about shot  I have
  4 new shocks on but car still skips out on bumps
  in turns at moderate to high speed  How hard are
  they to change  Can they be reconditioned
Difficult on front Easy on rear They are not expensive about 75100
for front and less than 50 for the rear

Its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the
proper equipment
