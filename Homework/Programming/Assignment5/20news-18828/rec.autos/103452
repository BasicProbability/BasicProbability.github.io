Subject Re service indicator of a BMW

Derek

There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
will come back on after 23 weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe 
atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know 
of no other tool anyone else 

About changing oil every 15000 miles thats ok on newer Audis they 
only require it after every 12000 miles I am talking about an oil change
Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden 
acceleration etc If yeah then the 15000 M oil change seems quite reasonable
But if you drive kinda fast Id get a bit up tight abot that 15000 thingy

a point to note just because the first light came on at 3k doesnt mean
all the others will come on every 3k too
