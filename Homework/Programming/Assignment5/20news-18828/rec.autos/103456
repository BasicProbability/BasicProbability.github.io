    Anyone else had the same problem 

       Well I have an 92 Taurus GL  Apparently they still havent fixed the
   problem with the rotors  Ive got 26K miles on the clock and Im getting
   the rotors and pads replaces tonightat my expense of course

I owned a Ford Mustang 4 that had endless brake problems  The bad
thing was that it had all other kinds of problems too  Spent 2 months
in the shop in the first 2 years I owned it bought new   So I got
rid of it and will more than likely not buy a Ford product in the
future  The thing that really ticked me off was how Ford treated me
They were such jerks it was unbelievable

 Joe


In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 TBird SC 
They all have had this problem There was a recall on the Tbird for the brake 
problem The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
after about 10K miles Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
the TBird Ill never buy a Ford again
