As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US  
while here in Europe they are rare Just wondering
 

Many cars sold here in Finland are small and cheap cars at least when
compared to other cars  note that we have over 120  car tax
And you couldnt expect a good auto mated to a 13 L engine
Most of the bigger cars are however sold with autos

Here in Australia most cars are manual privately owned anyway  Why
Not sure I think it has something to do with the fact that our car industry
in the past was more closely aligned with Europe than the US in the past
Now its aligned with Asia
