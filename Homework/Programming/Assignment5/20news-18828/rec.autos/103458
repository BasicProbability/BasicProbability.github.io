 anyone else experiencing a similar problem
 
 This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed When the clutch
 is first used in the morning about the first 4 miles of shifting there
 is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up  Then the
 clutch shifts smoothly  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
 Francisco Bay area from a lowhumidity environment  The dealer stated
 that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
 nonasbestos clutch material  No remedy Seems that moisture on clutch
 surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates
 
 Any comments out there


I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude See recautostech for more detail My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one It also seems affected by weather 
it is most noticeable and annoying on damp or cold days My dealer says
he cant reproduce the problem  I think Ill just sell the car
