 anyone else experiencing a similar problem
 
 This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed When the clutch
 is first used in the morning about the first 4 miles of shifting there
 is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up  Then the
 clutch shifts smoothly  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
 Francisco Bay area from a lowhumidity environment  The dealer stated
 that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
 nonasbestos clutch material  No remedy Seems that moisture on clutch
 surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates
 
 Any comments out there

The clutch on my 92 Honda Civic EXV EX in the US does this too
Its annoying  Now that I think about it is worse when the humidity is
high  The dealer also claims theres nothing they can do since the clutch is 
a selfadjusting hydraulic design  Yeah right
