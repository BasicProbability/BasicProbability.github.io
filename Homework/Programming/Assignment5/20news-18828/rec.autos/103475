 anything if he hadnt emptied his gun into the asshole  Texasits
 whole other country
 
 That reminds me of one of Texass adsyou hear a guy speaking in
 French like its a letter home then the French moves to the 
 background and a Frenchaccented voice come to the foreground talking
 about how he went walking on the beach and it felt so much like
 home that he decided to take his shoes offand the rest of his
 clothes It ended with please send bail 
 
 On an recautos note does anyone carry a gun on them or keep one in
 their car which is bad idea isnt it if you work in a bad part of
 town or regularly go through one  Is this a loaded question  
 
 I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded
 magazine handy which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma For those
 times that Im travelling interstate I keep an unloaded 
 SW 44 Magnum revolver in the glove box with a speedloader

 in my pocket which is legal everywhere under Federal law Illinois
 State Police be hanged
 
 As Ive said before this is stricly for defense my insurance
 will pay to replace my car but I only have one life

Carrying a pistol loaded or unloaded in the glove compartment is
considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without
a concealed weapons permit  Unless the law has been changed recently
carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal
I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
traffic infraction and observed a 357 magnum revolver sitting on the
seat  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
because it was not concealed  The article stated that if the gun had
been discovered in the glove box it would have been considered a crime
