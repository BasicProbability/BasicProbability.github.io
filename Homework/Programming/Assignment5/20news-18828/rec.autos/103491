Subject Re what is the deal with bluebook value of an auto

In article 1993Apr2214370913360newsengconvexcom newtonconvexcom Vicki Newton writes

i am in the process of buying a new auto  i havent decided yet whether
i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new
auto purchase

i know that the blue book value for the car is 2825  an acquaintence
has offered to give me blue book value for the car  i am just wondering
if this is a standard measure for negotiating a resale price or if i
can hope to get more money from someone else  what exactly is blue book
value based on  i know that for its year 88 my car has low mileage
 50000  it is in excellent working condition but does have a few
dings on the exterior nothing major  do any of these facts alter the
fair selling price of the car  i am not looking to rip anyone off i
just naturally want to get the best price for the car

thanks a million

A dealer will make money off you in three ways if you let him

	1  New car markup over his cost remember his holdback
	2  Arranging financing through the dealership and
	3  Screwing you on the trade

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2  3  Buying a car at 
dealers cost is meaningless if he makes 1000 on the trade andor gets a 
kickback from the bank

Blue book you need to know if youre talking average wholesale or average 
retail is a good guide to value for a car  If you are selling it yourself 
try to get average retail and chances are youll have done ok

Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends
