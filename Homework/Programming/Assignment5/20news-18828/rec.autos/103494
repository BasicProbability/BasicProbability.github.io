	I was curious as to what people thought of the VW Corrado VR6
Thats about it

						Outatime 
it hauls butt handles nice but is junk  i drove a brand new one for a day
as a loaner  the key was already rustingseems they stamp their keys out
of potmetal  all the controls seemed really junkclutch was heavy
door locks power buttons sunroof controls etc  seemed really cheap
no way i would pay 24k for this baby  no airbag either  i also drove a svx
for a daystickered at 30k but going out the door for 21ka much better
buy imo  although it is more of a sports touring couperoomy etc
the corrado is more of a small sports car  the ergonomics and leather in the
svx was twice as nice as the corrados  both had smooth strong engines
