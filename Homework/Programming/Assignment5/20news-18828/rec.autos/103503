Subject Re comparing saabs  bmws

I dont know about Saabs but whenever there is a long temr tset in a magazine
they always say that tehyre are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring
every so often I wouldnt expect that from such a quality car why 
doesnt anything like this ever happen on BMWs Maybe coz theyre quality
cars
