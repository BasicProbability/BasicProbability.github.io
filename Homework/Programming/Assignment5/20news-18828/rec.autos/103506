I got a price quote of 1887500 for a Camry V6 wABS from a Toyota dealer in 
Eatontown I came back to that dealer in two weeks to sign a purchase agreement
Then I was told that the salesperson made an error in pricing I walked out of 
that dealer I wonder if this kind of practice is common with Toyota dealers 
Is the price quote written on the salespersons business card binding
I would appricate any comments


I had a similar experience  We had a written quote which had been mailed
to us from the salesman at one of these nohaggle Toyota dealers for
a Camry XLE wABS leather etc  The price seemed fair but when we
went in to take them up on their offer they discovered that certain
extra cost items hadnt been included in their original written quote
It would have totaled an extra 1100 and in spite of the fact that we
had a written quote they said there was nothing they could do

Bottom line quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
the Toyota dealers think theyve got such a superior auto that they
dont have to deal  We walked went out and bought a new LH car
Eagle Vision TSI and I dont regret it one bit
