 I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
 Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX
 
 But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  Id assume easier
 since were removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  Lets hear peoples opinions

This really bugs me  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle
but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
in California  What a bunch of crap  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
enviromental benefit in Europe while here its illegal for the same reason

The particulates are nothing but carbon  They are just an annoyance at worst
Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions torque or engine
durability  Its also cheaper

Just to clear things up as to why I posted the question that way
I was debating with a coworker about diesels  I claimed they were
cleanerburning than gas engines  He said the extra junk put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses   I made all the SAME claims
you did  But one question of his was what about the carbon  I said it
was harmless but he wanted to know how to get rid of it  I suggested
scrubbers  I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than cats  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber  Id like
to know just to answer his final question  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise

BTW I named my subject Dirty Diesels because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that theyd
read it
