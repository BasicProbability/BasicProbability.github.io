Subject Honda Headrest Stuck  Advice Please

An aquaintence has a 87 Accord  The drivers side headrest was
accidentally put in backwards and has jammed  According to the
dealer the only way to get it out is to spend several hours
disassembling the seat  This is the second time I have heard of this
happening and I wonder whether theres an easier way to get the
headrest back out  Has anyone else ever dealt with this problem
Your advice would be appreciated

Please email and I will summarize if there is interest
