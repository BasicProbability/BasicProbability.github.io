Subject Re what is the deal with bluebook value of an auto

Mail bounced so

In article 1993Apr2214370913360newsengconvexcom you write
i am in the process of buying a new auto  i havent decided yet whether
i should sell my current car myself or trade it in as part of the new
auto purchase

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it 
yourself if you dont mind that extra hassle  Having a tradein on a purchase
just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing

i know that the blue book value for the car is 2825

I assume this is retail bluebook  There are two bluebook prices one for
retail and one for wholesale  You really want the retail price if you can 
get it  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage
and extras on your particular car  You should look all this stuff up yourself
Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country
that may not apply in your area  For example blue book prices are low for
California  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is
to call around and see what its selling for if any used lots have one or
looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices  It 
might be more time efficient to take a small loss rather than hold out for
6 months for the best price

an acquaintence
has offered to give me blue book value for the car

I dont know what you mean by an acquaintance but I would make darn sure
that I was paid that is cashiers check in full before delivery  Theres
a real temptation when selling to a pseudofriend to be more accomodating
than you should  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying
in full at the start with a cashiers check or cash then I would go
elsewhere  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot
or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook  Thats probably a safer approach
than selling to a private party
