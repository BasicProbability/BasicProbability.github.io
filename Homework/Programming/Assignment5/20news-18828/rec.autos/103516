Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients ie Cd mentioned in magazines  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
what does this mean in the real world  Is there a way to calculate new top speedsassuming the car is not rev limited at top speed or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from 34 to 33


    I dont remember the formulas off hand as it has been awhile since
I took aerodynamics and havent used the stuff since 
The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and
fuel consumption When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater
than what the vehicles engine can overcome it has reached its top speed
autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance
Since drag opposes the vehicles motion the engine must make up for that
by burning more fuel Anyway since the geometery of an auto is rather
complex the Dragpressure coeffiecentetc is either found experimentaly or
using a numerical method

anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is

            Cd  dq2R

       where d is the drag force q the flow velocity and R is the radius
of the clyinder
   To get a rough very rough estimate you can set R at 12 the cars
width q at the cars speed and knowing the Cd find the drag force that
the car would need to overcome
