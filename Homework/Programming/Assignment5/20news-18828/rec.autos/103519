Subject REVIEW 1989 Ford Taurus SHO
From davidbondscuttinghoutxus David Bonds 


GKI hear that tires for this car can get really expensive  I
GKcurrently have Goodyear GT4s that cost the previous owner 500
GKfor four

Try Eagle GAs wear better cost less lose little handling and are
quieter  Im going to switch to 225s in my next set with new rims
Fitti Twists if I can afford em by the time my GAs wear out

GKis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal  Also I began
GKto wonder how strong that brake really is  Today I backed out of
GKparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed
GKthe glowing brake light  Oops

Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when its in even if youre
giving it enough gas to normally move it in 1st  You might need a brake
adjustment

GKThe drivers power window creaks when closed all the way  The same
GKthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable  Oddly all the
GKother windows work smoothly

Watch it closely the glass actually flexes from the torque in the motor it
seems stronger in the drivers window then the others

GKIm liking the interior amenities more and more each day  The
GKcupholders are great

Ive found the location under the armrest in between the seats to be a
pain but like having them  They moved it into the dash pop out in the
91 model year MUCH better

GKI really feel like I dont deserve this car  I really cant
GKbelieve that I could afford it  I got this car ten years
GKahead of schedule  

I did the same thing  Got a black 89 with 655k miles on it for 8k
in July 92

GKIve put together the responses to my questions about the cars as
GKwell as other posts with useful information on these cars  Ill be
GKposting this in the form of a FAQ soon

Grabbed it and archived it  Thanks

GKIf anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up
GKI dont know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one but
GKmaybe someone out there does

Ill be starting one this summer one way or the other current software
I use dosent support mailing lists but is on the RSN list  if not Im
going to upgrade to another package that DOES have it that is if nobody
else beats me to it  Will make an announcement here when it goes up
