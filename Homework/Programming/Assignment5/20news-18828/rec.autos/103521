 My wife and I looked at and drove one last fall This was a 1992 model
 It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered I could not imagine driving it in the
 mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds I
 have read that the new 1993 models have a newer improved hp engine 
 
 Im quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said once
 its broken in it will feel more powerful I had been used to driving a
 Jeep 40L 190hp engine I believe the 92s Land Cruisers Land Yachts
 were 30L the sames as the 4Runner which is also underpowered in my

The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 40L straight 6 which only has about 150hp 
and 220lbft of torque  Plenty offhighway marginal on the highway
The 93 has a much improved 42L straight 6 with 200hp and 275ftlb torque

 They are big cars very roomy but nothing spectacular

If you take them on rough trails youll see the difference  The Cruiser
is an order of magnitude better in offhighway ability
