 If the Mustang andor SHO platform were designed for 130mph it would
 come with better seatbelts more supportive seats a stronger
 passenger compartment cage better brakes a stiffer suspension
 different tires and a body design that takes advantage of aero
 effects to keep the car on the ground
 
 In other words itd be a 1993 RX7





Yeah and then wed pay 30000  Go with a 50 LX Mustang  Most bang for your 
buck
