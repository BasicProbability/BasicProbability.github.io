V16  must be one somewhere

Believe Bugattis cominghas out  one  Something like 4 turbos
and mucho macho HP  One cool price too as i heard  At any rate
the point is im pretty sure there is indeed one in production
tho rather limited

This is NO Bugatti  Its labeled a Bugatti but has nothing to do with 
the Bugattis of yore from what I understand  Just some ppl wanting to
build a silly supercar and use that name to sell it

Drew may be thinking of the Cizeta Morodor v16t but that hasnt reached
production at least not yet  As for the Bugatti well I have to agree
with Matt it aint the top dog it aint sexy and sveltlooking and it
aint a real Bugatti  In fact it looks like its in tight competition
with the Consulier for the most buttugly car of the decade award

It isnt that bad  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared
to the slab sides on the Consulier  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V12
thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together  Also Ettore
Bugattis nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
development  So thats about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in
todays world  Much like Enzo Ferraris illegitamate son being allowed to
take over part of Ferrari as well 

I dont know of any cars with v4 but there are a number of motorcycles
with them  but I couldnt tell you which ones all motorcycles look alike
to me   D

Thats funny  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about cages 


Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V4s and the VF line of Hondas were all V4s
from the VF400F through the VF1000F including the RC30 race bike and
the present VFR750F  It should be noted that Lancia built a V4 in
recent history in the Fulvia HF a very pretty Italian coupe
