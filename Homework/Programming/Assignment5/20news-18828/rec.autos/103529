My Nissan Quest has been doing 20mpg city though its first few tanks
were more like 17mpg  The V6 and AT are remarkably smooth
                                          
Agreed  I own a Mercury Villager and Im very impressed with the V6 and
the AT  In the past Ive been biased towards manualstandard transmissionsI owned
an Aerostar with a 5speed it was awesome but settled with the AT in the
Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with its performance
 
BTW Consumers Report in their report on the Villager alluded to some
funny noises from the AT Ive been listening for them but havent noticed anything
unusual
