In a previous article gwmspl1splloralcom Gary W Mahan says

Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients ie Cd mentioned in magazines  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
what does this mean in the real world  Is there a way to calculate new top speedsassuming the car is not rev limited at top speed or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from 34 to 33

Its pretty complex and Cd isnt the whole story either  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd 

To calculate drag use this formula

D  12  rho  v2  Cd  S

Where D is the drag force lbs rho is the local air density slugsft3
V is the velocity fts and S is the frontal area ft2  Note that the
pieces called 12  rho  v2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
a fancy aero term for air pressure or force 

Note that power is

P  F  v

Where P is power lbffts F is the force drag in this case lbf and v
is velocity fts 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one by substituting D for
force you get a velocity cubed term  Thats why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed  Ditto for decreases in Cd 

So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from 34 to 33 your new top
speed is  sound of trumpet fanfare

101 mph

Sorry to dissappoint
