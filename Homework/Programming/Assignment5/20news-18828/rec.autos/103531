The whire wheels arent chromed they were to be painted silvergrey

The accelerating from a stop shouldnt be doggy because of the light
weight of the car

Dont pull the topto make it reach the snaps I pulled a couple out of
the top doing that  Replacing the spanps usually doesnt work  Let it
sit in th e sun open on the car for a couple hours the try  GENTLY

I continually blew up the 4 connecting rod bearing be sure your not
buring too much oil

Dont expect too much of a smooth ride  The lever arm shocks hold the
road and your bladder  The are ultraexpensive  Supposedly the can be
rebuilt  J C Whitney sell a shock replacement kit the uses standard
shocks

I had to rebuid boththe brake and clutch master cylinder in addition to
the clutch slave  This work made a world of changes

Be sure the carb is the original type replacement  My 1970 had dual
Stomberg oil dampenned side draft carbs

Ask if the clutch has ever been replaced  To replace the engine and
tranny have to be pulled as a unit

If you need more I had mine all through hiogh school  Lots of
maintenance to use every day
