 There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
 will come back on after 23 weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe 
 atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
 used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know 
 of no other tool anyone else 
 
 About changing oil every 15000 miles thats ok on newer Audis they 
 only require it after every 12000 miles I am talking about an oil change
 Just a query do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully Like no sudden 
 acceleration etc If yeah then the 15000 M oil change seems quite reasonable
 But if you drive kinda fast Id get a bit up tight abot that 15000 thingy
 
 a point to note just because the first light came on at 3k doesnt mean
 all the others will come on every 3k too

Hmm but the service indicators that I have works this way
  There are 5 green1 yellow 1 red indicators
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off
  
  After service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again

So I expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator

Its the first european car I have and changing oil at 15000 miles is a 
surprise to me and its a big plus  But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time I thought its the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil

Any BMW owner on the net Response welcomed

PS  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW
