Subject Re The 1994 Mustang

 You know Im a Ford fan I must say so Im looking forward to the next
 Mustang  I have faith that it will be a fine product more desireable
 than the Camaro is now  You know thats MHO  
 
 Truethats your opinion
 
 They beat Ford to the market with the CamaroFirebird but really only
 in words  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
 end of the year keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
 since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there  I wouldnt
 press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it
 Besides no bowtie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway
 
 True again I wouldnt take a free Mustanghonest
 
 The next Mustang will be Fords highest profile car  It attracts
 way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because its heritage
 is more embedded in the general public  Dont lie to yourself and
 believe Ford will forfeit that
 
 FYI they already did
 Too bad that the current Mustang cant even compete with the new
 Camaro without using an active imagination
 Right now few cars can compare with the 93 Camaro Think about it
 20000 for a car that will out perform all but a few exotics
 If you are now swearing at me look at the statsthey dont lie
  There are NO comparable cars in its class certinaly not for its price
 
   You knowintelligent critical spews like The Mustang bites man  
 Some of you are already beginning  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
 will be comparable performers as usual
 
 I also agree This subject is one that will never be setteled
 Except maybe at the  track 
 
 Unless the Ford gets the 32v 300hp Romeo  You dont seriously believe
 that it was designed for the Mark VIII only do you
 
 Hey can you imagine the potential of a MODIFIED LT1
 Folks in a few years we will surpass the levels of performance 
 achieved in the late 60s thats scary

You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid

Like they say in the airforce with enough horsepower anything will fly

I can put a 32valve V8 with twin Garret4s on Yugo and get 77sec QM
Thats useless  Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track
or on the street

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultralongthrow stick shifts of
the 50 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 I ll buy it in 6 mos 

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 50 that sounds in every hairpin turn 

And bythe way 50 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks 
Hello  this is the 90 s
