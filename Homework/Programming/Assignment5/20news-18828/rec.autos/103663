 I heard the diesels are considered cleanerburning than
 gas engines because the emit less of Carbon Monoxide
 Hydrocarbons and Oxides of Nitrogen  CO HC NOX
 
 But they can put out a lot of particulate matter  I heard
 something about legislation being discussed to clean up
 diesel emissions  Is there anything in the works to
 install scrubbers for diesels  How about the feasibility
 of installing them on trucks and cars  Would it be any
 different than a catylitic converter  Id assume easier
 since were removing particulate matter instead of converting
 gasses  Lets hear peoples opinions
 
 
VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps  Also VW
uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well although I dont know the
mechanics of it
 
Many diesel carsbusses and trucks in Europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions already well below legal limits anyway
 
Its a shame GM had to soil the diesels reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions

   I sure dont know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars trucks and busses but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants or at the wrong time or both

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars  They stink  And its always
 rollupthewindows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family

   I dont think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines and thats why they stink  So the 
 invisible unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels  Yeah
 well so what  Someone forgot about the visible stinky kind and
 as far as I am concerned those kind are just as bad

    I am all for destinking the diesel vehicles  Itll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner too
