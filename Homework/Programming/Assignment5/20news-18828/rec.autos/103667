Subject Car Alarms Which One


Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm
lets go on the assumption that one is desired  The question then remains
which one  Ive owned a Hornet and was satisfied but not enough to get
another for my new car  The Alpine has been highly recommended but what about
Clifford and VSEs Derringer 2  Any others  I want all of the standard stuff
door lock interface starter kill light flash LED valet mode passiveactive
shockmotion sensor etc  Thanks for the advice
