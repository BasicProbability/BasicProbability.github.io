  I am curious about knowing which commericial cars today
have v engines

V4  I dont know of any

V4s I dont know of any I4s and flat4s are abundant

V6  Legend MR3 MR6

A whole htload Minivans pickups just about any car above the
subcompactcompact range and below the fullsize range with a few
exceptions

I6s are much more rare now the only one I personally know of thats
still in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the Fseries pickups
I think that Jeeps big 6s are also straight sixes but Im not a
big Jeep person

V8  Dont know of any

Where are you to not know of V8s There are Mustangs Cadillacs
Lincolns Camaros Corvettes Thunderbirds all real fullsize
pickups Crown Vics Chevy MobyHHHHCaprice  and even a few
Japanese and European veehickles with V8s

V10  Dodge Viper Dodge promises a truck with a V10

V12  Jaguar XJS

Dont Ferarri and Lamborghini both use V12s extensively
