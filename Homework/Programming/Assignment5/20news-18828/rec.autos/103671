  I am curious about knowing which commericial cars today
have v engines

V4  I dont know of any
Because there is no such thing

A friend had a Ford Taunus era early 60s that did have a V4 in it

I lost a bet on it I find it hard to believe there are no recent cars
with a V4 in them Any recent ones
