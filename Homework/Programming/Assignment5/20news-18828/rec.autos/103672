As a matter of interest does anyone know why autos are so popular in the US while 
here in Europe they are rare Just wondering

Primarily milage  Gas is much more expensive so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer  This
along with narrow old cities also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines  These engines usually dont have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic  So having engines that dont work well with
autos and a great concern for milage the usual Eurocar has a
manual

Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals  If youve got the
money for the car youve got the money for the gas and the engine to
drive through the slushbox

As automatics become more efficient the bigotry is probably
reduced  Still everyone knows how to drive a manual and cars are
cheaper with one and it saves a little expensive fuel  So there
arent compelling reasons to go automatic
