These are the extensions I know of
ch   Switzerland
se   Sweden
fi   Finland
uk   UK
Com  US
Edu  US     are both com and edu US 
fr   France
dk    denmark
no    Norway

com and edu are both United States one refers to commercial institutions
the other to mental  I mean educational  institutions  gov is also
pretty much US it refers to government institutions  Internet was built on
the AARP backbone a US Defense contractor network that used the extension

I think you mean ARPA AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons
and I seriously doubt that theyd want young whippersnappers building
anything on their backbones what with decalcification and all 

to identify the type of organisation  Internet extended the convention for
other countries but the US retained the old conventions

The general convention is that if it doesnt have a country tag on it its
a US site That includes
	com	commercial 
	edu	educational 
	mil	US Military sites 
	gov	US Govt nonmilitary sites eg NASA sites
	org	anyone who is none of the above
There are sites with such tags that are nonUS sites but they will have
the country extension eg xxxxeduau is an extension I saw today
US sites can also use the us extension but as Mr Smith pointed 
out the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone and they default
to US sites if theres no country code

I would suggest that anyone who didnt know this or wants to know
more about it on a nonsystemadministrative level check out
the book TheWholeInternetUsersGuideandCatalog by Ed Krol
or is it Catalog and Users Guide I can never remember and my copy
is my desk at home Its a very good notnecessarilytechnical
guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it including
USENET I dont think its part of the Nutshell series but it is
published by OReilly and Associates

This should go to one of the news newsgroups but damned if I
can figure out which one
