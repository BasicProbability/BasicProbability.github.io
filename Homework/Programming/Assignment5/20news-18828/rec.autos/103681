hi
would someone like to post a comparative analysis quantitative
measures hp etc and more so the qualitative feel of how they compare
for the driving feel handling noise responsiveness etc for the
saab 9009000s and the bmw 35 series
any comments on just comparing the 900 with the 9000 re handling 
i take it that the saabs and bmws are comparable for reliability and
all thatwould be nice if flaming wars could be avoided and
folks just post their experiences 

I had a 82 Saab 900 Turbo and now have a 87 BMW 325is

There is no comparison for handling reliability or overall quality of
engineering The BMW wins hands down After 5 years I was sick and tired
of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB The 6year
old BMW is still as sweet as it was new

But I see you are posting from western MA BMWs SUCK in the snow
I have aggressive snows plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back and I
still try to avoid driving in the snow I happily took the SAAB through
blizzard conditions without a worry I would say this is the single design
flaw in the BMW
