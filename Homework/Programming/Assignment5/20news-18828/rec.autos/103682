Ashtrays and cigarette lighters  These should be an option

You forget that the cigarette lighter plug is essential for plugging in radar
detectors and lights The ashtrays are also essential because they are great
places to keep change and tokens

Wouldnt you rather have some type of standard electrical plug instead of 
that fire hazard waiting to happen adaptor I know I would and I would 
also prefer to have sensibly placed cup holders instead of an ashtray my 
car came with coin holders already built in
