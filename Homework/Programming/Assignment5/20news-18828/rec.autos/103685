Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph 
on the same 3 to 4 lane road  Around Washington DC they cant keep traffic 
flowing at 55

Actually thatd be 155 mph and 60 mph the legal speed limit for trucks 
in two lanes each direction Its a hell of a rush when those trucks fly 
by or was that me flying by them Who cares the rush is really something 
else and so is the draft
