 I have a pair of sport seats from 85 MR2 for sale blueblack

As the owner of an MR2 and having several friends who own them
I am very uncomfortable when I see an ad like this  I have known
several people who have lost the seats from their MR2 in the middle
of the night to support the Celica retrofit trade  and the 
insurance companies have been very miserable to deal with
in all cases  

When these seats are seen for sale they are most often stolen
So it would be nice to see a statement saying where they came from
That would at least help to soothe the reflexive fear that someone
is making a buck at someone elses expense

Ill give this seller the benefit of the doubt but people should be
aware the the vast majority of MR2 seats on the marketespecially
those that are in Celicasare stolen


Lee

 BTW  They are incredible seats  So if its legit go for it 



I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement 
I see a lot of computers advertized on the net and my friend just had been
releived of his machine  all the netcomputer ads are for stolen computers
Where did you learn logic

As for the seats they were replaced by a much harder literally Celica GTS
seats due to my back problem That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets
and thats why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets

Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above
It hurts
