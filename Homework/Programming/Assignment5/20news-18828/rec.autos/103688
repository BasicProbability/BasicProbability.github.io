A GT40  Gotta be in my top 5 favoritecarsofalltime
list  Where is this place  Was the car for sale  COME ON I
need detailsor not  Anyways I just had to say WOW at the
sighting of such a fine beast  But remember the Mustang will
forever be the true King of the Road  

The place was in what used to be a small town now a suburb north of 
Atlanta I dont know if the car was for sale or not you wouldnt put
a price on the window on this type of car anyway 

Damn straight As far as Ive heard unless the owner is very
hard up the GT40s are not for sale at any price that mere
mortals could afford

And maybe the Mustang
will be forever King of the Road the GT40 isnt road legal

I think the GT40 actually is street legal although that particular
question is moot see the price figures below

This car was right hand drive werent they all like that How much does
a GT40 go for How many were made

I wish I could find my ShelbyAmerican guide it included the GT40
registry as of 88 or so There were precious few of them made 
fifty is the number that springs to mind they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturers Cup or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarris 13year winning streak in in 65
and they are all accounted for The last price I saw estimated on a
GT40 was a little bit over 1000000 yes thats right ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of 

I dont recall offhand what the drive configuration was although
Im certain some must have been LHD as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing The drivertrain was the Ford 427 hiriser I think 
andor sideoiler coupled to various 4speed transmissions They
also used 3speed manuals they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the 427 Layout was
rearengine reardrive with the bundle of snakes exhaust
headersI can remeber other bits and pieces of info but I
cant remember whether they applied to the GT40 or the Shelby
Cobra Daytona CoupeIll try and find that reference
