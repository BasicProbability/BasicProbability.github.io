Subject MG Tseries FOR SALE


1954 MGTF with frameup restoration in early 70s  a local show winner
Driven very little and stored inside since then  mostly collected dirt 
dust  Needs attention to brake cylinders like all MGTs but otherwise
ready to run  Chrome  paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent
The engine a 1250cc was completely overhauled by a machine shop  It is
priced at 12000

1953 MGTD Good shape but hasnt been run since 70s  Needs engine work
but no rust and everything is with it including a top side curtains and
carpet that were new and havent seen the outdoors since the 70s 9500

1952 MGTD Basket Case  Id call it a parts car but its too good
for that  Everything seems to be there except the tach  Would make
a good project car or parts car if you insist  No apparent rust but the
upholstery is a disaster  Stored inside since the 70s  The top was
new but now soso  This one has wire wheels  Looking for 4500

All three cars will be sold as they stand with no hassles or haggles
Time has passed by and it is time to part company  Prices are negotiable
