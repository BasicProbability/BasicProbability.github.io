None of the configurations are perfectly inherently balanced which
is what I was talking about  Balance shafts and mass on either
ends of the cranks can eliminate these forcesmoments which is
something I also pointed out

and didnt you also say that it was easier to add masses than to
add balance shafts  the sad truth is that some makers dont
bother to put balance shafts on their big shaky 4s

if this is ridiculous kindly explain why its been more than 10 years
since i studied this stuff  

Flat 4s and I4s both have the potential to be nearly vibration
free  Because Subaru does that has nothing to do with I4s in
general or Porsche

I think Subaru somehow connecting themselves to Porsche is an
absurdity and Im not a Porsche fan  Big wing dings  These
configurations overhead cams etc etc etc have been around
for nearly 100 years 

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles
for the orthodox inline 4 they are using a horizontally opposed 4
which is unique in that market segment  and porsche also uses a flat
six in their 911 so whats the problem  i dont see any claim that
their engine is as good as a porsches they are simply pointing out
that they use the same configuration as a porsche if you want to
nitpick ad campaigns i think there are far more blatant excesses than
this
