          What car are we talking about If its Camaro ChevelleGTO
    Nova Etc there are a bunch of places to get them

 A 68 Corvette but I dont want to put Corvette seats in it  The original
 seats are in exc shape but they are uncomfortable as hell  Im going to
 store those and find a set to drive in  I have all the Vette catalogs but
 Im looking for a more generic type seat  I can modify the brackets but 
 cushion height and overall width are a concern  Ive looked through some
 local boneyards without success  I would just like to find a pair of 
 cheapos to use this summer

         Call around to some wrecking yards in your area andif they have
    any look at Fiero seats They are right down on the floor like a vette
    and not too wideIf you cant find any let me know and ill call around
    here for you Im sure these yards ship stuff all the time
