   Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v
   This model did come in a wagon a very quick wagon  Very rare also

Being a satisfied Audi owner 90 100 turbo quattro my 4th Audi I
get the free VAG magazine The latest issue presented a new S4 Avant
wagon with a 42 litre V8 Id like one of these 

Btw this is my second quattro and my third turbo and I must say that
even in the summer with dry roads the quattros give so much extra in
road holding and balance that I hope I can afford them always
