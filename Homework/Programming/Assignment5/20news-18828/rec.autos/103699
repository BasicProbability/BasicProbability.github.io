Subject Highmileage Audi question


A question for any highmileage Audi owners out there I am
interested in buying a 1989 Audi 5000S for 5500 Cdn  The
reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
155000 km on it just under 100000 mi  The cars owner
claims the car is in good condition  My question is how
reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car  Any problem areas that
I should look out for

Any help would be greatly appreciated  Post responses andor
email me

Thanks

Steve Hui
