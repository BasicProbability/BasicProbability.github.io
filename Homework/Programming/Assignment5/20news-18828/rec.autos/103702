Subject RE IMPALA SS GOING INTO


In a previous article georgehowellgoucherwb3ffvamprorg George Howell says

GM has always screwed the rest of the divisions in favor of the
Corvette The current platform is no exception The detuned Camaro and
Firebird is a load of crap to keep people from realizing that they can
buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about 10000

I like the idea of an Impala SS but if they really wanted to impress
me they would throw in a big phat 454 Imagine the cops in their Taurus
police package 30 and 38 litres as they stare at your taillights


gimme a break  you KNOW chevyd screw that up just like that almost great
truck with the big phat 454  Have you ever seen the mufflers on that 
thingits amazing it moveswhich isnt to say its not a good idea
but im quite sure chevyd screw it up the same way

DREW
