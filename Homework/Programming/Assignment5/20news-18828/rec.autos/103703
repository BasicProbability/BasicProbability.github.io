My car was recently destroyed in a hail storm  
I fully expected to get jerked around by the insurance company
I wasnt the only one who had hail damage  State Farm
opened its claim centers on evenings and weekends and flew down
additional adjusters from Dallas

i have no experience with State Farm but i think its important to
differentiate your experience from a typical accident

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner and also tends to
be well publicized in the media so its to the ins cos benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully  damage like this doesnt imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms so theres no reason
for them to stop covering you
thats a lot different from atfault accidents or theftrelated claims
which may be more indicative of claim patterns
