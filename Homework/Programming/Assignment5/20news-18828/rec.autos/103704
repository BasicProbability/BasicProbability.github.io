Subject Re Warped brake discs on 91 Taurus L

   In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 TBird
   SC  They all have had this problem There was a recall on the Tbird for
   the brake problem The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the
   rotors warp after about 10K miles Between this problem and the fit and
   finish problems on the TBird Ill never buy a Ford again

       I just had my rotors on my 92 Taurus GL changed less than 500 miles
   ago andyou guessed it Im noticing slight warpage in the left rotor
     I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a
   high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem  This is a brand new
   rotor bought from a Ford Dealership  Cant they even produce a brand new
   rotor that is not warped  Im currently negotiating with them to swap it
   out for a new rotor

       This is my first American build car and Im not overly impressed
