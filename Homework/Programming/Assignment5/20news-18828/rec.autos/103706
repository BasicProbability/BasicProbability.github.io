My father is have lots of problems with a 2 year old van  What is the
lemon law  What should he do if he qualifies

Talk to Philip Greenspun He took Ford to court recently and despite much
manouvering and trickery on Fords part he won Well actually I think
Ford settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped 
causing them trouble I love it when the little guy wins I dont have
Philips address anymore but a Philip where are you call may bring him
out of hiding

Cheers
Paul
