As the owner of an MR2 and having several friends who own them
I am very uncomfortable when I see an ad like this 
   
When these seats are seen for sale they are most often stolen
So it would be nice to see a statement saying where they came from
   
Ill give this seller the benefit of the doubt but people should be
           
aware the the vast majority of MR2 seats on the marketespecially
those that are in Celicasare stolen

I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster 
 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement 
Me thinks thee dost protest too much  12 
 
Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above

He made no allegations and specifically gave the seller the benefit of the
doubt  He simply made the net aware of the fact that many of these seats are
stolen so watch out and ask questions when buying  Thats good advice to
follow when buying anything from a third party on the net or elsewhere
It hurts
Touchy touchy
