I just have got to remind all of you that this is it  Yes
thats right somtime this fall Ford the granddaddy of cars
will be introducing an allnew megacool
waytoofastforAccorddrivers Mustang  Its supposed to be
100 streamlined looking similar to the Mach III concept car
Ford came out with around January  I cant wait  Anyone out
there hear anything about it recently


If everything Ive read is correct Ford is doing nothing but re
skinning the existing Mustang with MINOR suspension modifications
And the pictures Ive seen indicate they didnt do a very good job
of it  

The new mustang is nothing but a recycle of a 20 year old car
