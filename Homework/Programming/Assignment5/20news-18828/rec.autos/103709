  There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
  will come back on after 23 weeks The tool is in fact illegal in Europe 
  atleast It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
  used BMW and a few weeks later all the lights come on Other than that I know 
  of no other tool anyone else

 Hmm but the service indicators that I have works this way
   There are 5 green1 yellow 1 red indicators
   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
   your car The computer will actually sense how you drive your car and
   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
   on And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off
   
   After service the mechanicor you will reset the service indicators and the
   computer starts counting again
 
 So I expect to have a toolor a procedure to reset it so the green lights will 
 come on and the yellow and red lights will go off
 
 I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
 indicator
 
 Its the first european car I have and changing oil at 15000 miles is a 
 surprise to me and its a big plus  But I wonder how that could happen
 since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time I thought its the oil and
 not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil
 
 Any BMW owner on the net Response welcomed
 
 PS  my initial question is how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW
 
 Derek 

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights
It will cost you 45 from a mailorder and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset
Why is reseting so important The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you 
Forget this in european cars you only need to change the oil every
15000 crap Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape and
extending its life will change it every 3000 inc filter Dont wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car 
I bought a bmw about 6 months ago it had 3 green lights on I have changed
the oil every 3000 completly flushed brake fliud changed all filtersoil
air and fuel changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
and a service 2 After nearly 6000 miles I am still on 2 green lights
After a winter in Burlington and it is snowing today that is not bad

Good luck
