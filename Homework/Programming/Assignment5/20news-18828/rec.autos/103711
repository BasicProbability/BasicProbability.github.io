GKOccasionally I have trouble shifting into reverse  The shifter
GKrefuses to enter the gate and I often grind the synchros trying to
GKget it into gear  Ill be watching this carefully in the next couple
GKof months

Enter 1st wait 23 seconds and then go into reverse  They use the same
synchros and youll never at least I havent groundemtofit when using
this technique

Or do like the manual says and put it in 3rd first then you can quickly
go into reverse no waiting
