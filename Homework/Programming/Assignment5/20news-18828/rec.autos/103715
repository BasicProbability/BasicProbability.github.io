BTW I just saw the new Q45 on TV this weekend  The big changes a
GRILLE has been added looks nice too and some WOOD for the
interior  Otherwise it looked largely unchanged 

They changed the lights and slope of the hood along with the new
grille  Otherwise it is unchanged

Interestingly their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG
design statement they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve
their own niche  unfortunately sales were only half those of the
LEXUS and hence they now join the pack  I still wonder if much of
the problem wasnt the slow start from the initial AD campaign

Personally I like the Q without the Grille
