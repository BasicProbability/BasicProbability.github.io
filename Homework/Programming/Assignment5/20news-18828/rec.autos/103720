Im not familiar with the trannies used in Winston Cup but in the transam
cars Ive played with the  transmissions were the racing variety with
dog clutches instead of sychros  In a transmission with dog clutches the
gears are always  engaged with each other and moving the dog clutches
engages the gears to the shafts  Motorcycle transmissions are the same way
Shifting without the clutch on a transmission with syncros can and will cause
transmission damage the only question being how long it  takesto grenade
something for the trans in my 87  Pulsar SE it was  about 35k miles but
it had a weak  tranny in the first place

just out of curiosity how is this dog clutch any different from a synchro
transmission  What you described SOUNDS the same to me  In fact what little
ive studied on trannies the instructor referred to the synchros as dogs
and said they were synonymous  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
gearbox and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting Or at least
that is what i was taught  Explain por favour

thanx

ps emails fine if this is inappropriate for here or if im the only bonhead
