 I dont think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid  Follow the manufacturers recommended oil weight  Some of the
 cars I have had all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at 30000 miles under normal driving
 conditions  Ive gone 100000 without changing the transmission oil and
 had to replace the transmission bearings My older cars used 85 weight
 oil whereas my 92 Honda uses 1030 motor oil or maybe 30 weight
