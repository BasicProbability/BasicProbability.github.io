Subject Re Changing brake fluidis it necessary

I agree with Jeffs reply  Ive never changed the brake fluid except when
having a brake job which is usually at around 80000 miles alot of
freeway driving  However I will start to do this as preventative
maintenance on my new car  Also there are brake system flushing agents
that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the
system it can cause problems so its been recommended NOT to use them unless
you are 100 certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent  Just for
your info I was quoted a price of labor2995 and fluid995 for
flushing the brake system this in conjunction with a break job so I dont
know if it was more without the brake job This is in the SF Bay Area
