The VillagerQuest seem like the best of the CravanVoyager copies to
come along since the Mazda MPV  The NISSAN MAXIMA engine paired with
the MAXIMA 4 speed Auto Trans should be an excellent drive train and
the rest of the vehicle seems well engineered  Only the price is
controversial

Hmm  The last time I checked VillagerQuest does not have a Maxima
engine and is very much under powered for its weight
