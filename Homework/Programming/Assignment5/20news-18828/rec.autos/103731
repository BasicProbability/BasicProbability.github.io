Didnt the Saab Sonnett have a V4 I recall someone telling that it was
something like 12 of a Ford 289

Not only the Sonett correct spelling but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V4 from Ford of Germany  This particular
motor had a 60 degree vee angle a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
ports  This motor was later stretched into the V6 commonly seen in the
Capri

The V4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size  But in the
Saab it made too much torque for the transmission which had been
designed for a 3cylinder 2stroke
