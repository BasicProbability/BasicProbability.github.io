Subject Ford Explorer question and SUV review


	Ok so in my ongoing search for a sport utility heres the latest


Toyota 4runner

	 Small Small Small Small The interior of this vehical is impossible
	for a large person Too bad it would have been the winner otherwise

Nissan Pathfinder
	
	Very low ceiling My head hit the roof Fun on bumps no Also has
	a cheaplooking interior

Isuzu Trooper

	Class act This is a really really nice vehical Very comfortable
	handled ok Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE But its huge
	and the engine is a bit too small for its bulk also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward Id buy this if it were 3k cheaper or 10
	shorter But at this size and for this price no I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco No Thanks


Chevy Blazer

	Cheap looking Small Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan but still 
	too small

Ford Explorer

	This is no sports car and its certainly not for the serious off roader
	But its big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper Its engine has plenty of power for everyday driving though it would
	be nice if it had a bit more The automatic tranny is pretty nice head and
	shoulders above my 90 mazda MPV The steering is not as tight as Id like
	but its acceptable The two door has easytoenter back seats Easier to get
	into in fact than the drivers seat of the 4runner and with a 10 shorter
	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny Yes Im a manual 
	shift biggot I admit it its the one Im thinking of buying 


	So that said is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it
	Anyone had any major problems Heard any horror stories 

	Also any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo both being essentially
	the same vehical


			Thanks


	Karl
