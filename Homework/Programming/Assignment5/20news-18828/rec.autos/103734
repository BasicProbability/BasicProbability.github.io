 Ive heard unconfirmed rumours that there is a new Integra being  
released
 for 94
 Does anybody have any info on this
 The local sales people know as much as I can throw them
 Parms
 still no sig

here we go again
now these are just rumors so dont quote me

New Integra supposedly wedge shaped again  175 hp and allwheel drive
in top models  Then a variant called the zxr comes later roadster

i think it gets unveiled at end of summer

Nothing about an airbag was mentioned but im sure itll have one
along with a nice hefty increase in sticker
