Hi  now that we have these GATSO photo speed traps here I was wondering if 
anyone knows if radar detectors are capable of detecting photo cameras If
not are there any other devices which will 

	Yup  Radar detectors that detect Ka band will pick up photo radar
as its reflected from some poor slob ahead of you that just got nailed

	BTW many photo radar installations in the southern US became
targets for highpowered rifles or had their lenses decorated with cow
flop etc  Not that Im advocating destruction of public property but you
get the picture
