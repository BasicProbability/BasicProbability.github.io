 GKOccasionally I have trouble shifting into reverse  The shifter
 GKrefuses to enter the gate and I often grind the synchros trying to
 GKget it into gear  Ill be watching this carefully in the next couple
 GKof months
 
 Enter 1st wait 23 seconds and then go into reverse  They use the same
 synchros and youll never at least I havent groundemtofit when using
 this technique
  
 Or do like the manual says and put it in 3rd first then you can quickly
 go into reverse no waiting

One more way which works in manual trans cars Ive driven and it is my
personal favorite the other suggestions above are great but try this
one too  

While pushing the shifter gently towards reverse let the clutch out
slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pulled into
position If you do it right the car wont jump backward nor will the
gears grind You will just glide back
