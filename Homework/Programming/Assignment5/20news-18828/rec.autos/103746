sighting of such a fine beast  But remember the Mustang will
forever be the true King of the Road  

Especially the 68 ShelbyAmerican GT500KR King of the Road so named
to steal GMs planned Camaro King of the Roads thunder 

And maybe the Mustang
will be forever King of the Road the GT40 isnt road legal

I think the GT40 actually is street legal although that particular
question is moot see the price figures below

Some GT40s are street legal some arent

This car was right hand drive werent they all like that How much does
a GT40 go for How many were made

I found my ShelbyAmerican guide There were a grand total 126 GT40s
built
		GT40 Coupes		55
		GT40 Road Cars		31
		GT40 Mk II		13
		GT40 Mk IIIs		 7
		GT40 Roadsters		 5
		Mirages			 3
		GT40 Mk IVs		12
		   	TOTAL	       126
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	612

Twelve of these cars were prototypes 48 racing coupes 31 road coupes
eight Mk II coupes 4 LHD Mk IIIs and 3 RHD Mk IIIs The other 
breakdowns follow the above list eg 12 were Mk IVs The LHDRHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs

The prices for those which can be bought are around the 1 Million
mark last I heard with a projection of some 35 Million or
thereabouts in 2000 It was second only to some pennyante Ferarri 

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturers Cup with his Cobras in 65 that
was also the year that he retired them from the ShelbyAmerican racing
team in favor of the Ford GT program the next year That victory
broke a 13 year Ferarri winning streak

Well theres lotsa info I could spout but Ill refrain Much of
this information comes from Hot Rod magazines Shelby American
CobraMustang Guide which has more info on the ShelbyAmerican 
Fords than you could ever want to know
