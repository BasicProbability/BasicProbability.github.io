In article C4wKBpB9weskimocom maveneskimocom Norman Hamer writes

  What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling Couple hours after
 you feel sober What Or should I just work with If I drink tonight I
 dont ride until tomorrow

Ill put in a vote for the latter A bike
takes a lot of involvement and I for one
do not want any accident to be my fault

I remember one artical where the reviewer
tried the radio on the bike not having had
one on any of his He stated that the bike
tended to go faster when the music was 
good I agree having felt like this my self
and this was not a physical imparement like
drinking just the emotional lift from music

First rule of ecology There is never only one sideeffect

Ride Well
