Subject Re Kawi Zephyr was Re Vision vs GpZ 550
From REE700AMAINEMAINEEDU

I dont know about the dinky little Zephyrs but the 1100 now
the ZR1100 looks alot like my 76 Z1 KZ900  The one I drooled over
at TriSports in Topsham ME was a looker

Yes Mercury axed the Zephyr name  Guess a lot of aging Republicans
wanted a Zephyr and confused the Mercury with the Kawasaki   Oh
well theyre better off with the Kawasaki anyways  Maybe itll shake the
stick out of their asses and  make Libertarians out of them

As to the GPz  Zephyr the only GPz Ive seen had the ballbuster
gas tank profile not the smooth saddle  to  gas tank transition
Motorcyclist claims the Zephyr  ZR is the modernized Z1 KZ from the
seventies
