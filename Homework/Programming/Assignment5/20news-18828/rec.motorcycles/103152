 	While were on the subject has anyone else noticed that the 12 deep
 well in Craftsmans 60 SAE deep well set is too small to fit a 12 bolt or
 nut	When I took the socket in for an exchange EVERY  one of the 12
 deep well sockets on the rack had the exact same problem

Not to imply that you didnt but since you didnt mention it
did you measure the size of your test nut with callipers Were all three
cross lengths no more than 12 Ive seen bolt heads and even a few
nuts which got slightly thicker further down toward the basa sort of
a trapizodial cross section

	That I did not do however the sample bolt I took to the store fit
rather well in the following  12 open end wrench 12 box end wrench 12
12point normal socket  I take that as meaning its a 12 bolt head
 
But as several people have pointed out and as Im noting in the tool FAQ
Im writing up in case anyone will want it a lifetime guarantee doesnt
necessiarly mean better tools

	Yup  At 6 a socket I want the  thing to FIT
