 Well at least I damaged my own bike  If I had done it to someone elses
 property Id really feel like a jerk  As it is I just feel stupid
 
 I dont mean to be a cynic but     you may want to reconsider
 having the body work done right away  The same type of thing
 may happen again  Wait till you get used to the bike etc

Well I waited a whole week to take the pastic bits off and take them
to the body shop  Is that long enough
