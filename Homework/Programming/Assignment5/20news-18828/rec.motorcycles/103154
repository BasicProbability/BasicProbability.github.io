No laughing please  I have a few questions  First of all do I
need a relay  Are there different kinds and if so what kind should
I get  Both horns are 12 Volt

	I did some backoftheeyelids calculations last night and I figure
these puppies suck up about 10 amps to work at maximum efficiency ie the
cager might need a shovel to clean out his seat  Assumptions  125dBA at one
meter  Neglecting solid angle considerations and end effects and other
acoustic niceties from the shape of the horn itself this is a power output
of 125 Watts  125Watts12Volts is approx 10 Amps

	Yes get a relay

	Yes tell me how you did it I want to do it on the ZX

Later

Ill post a summary after I get enough information  Ill include
tips like how to know when the monkey is pulling your leg  Shouldnt
monkeys have to be bonded and insured before they work on bikes
