 Anyone try the spray on chain wax that was reviewed in one of the moto
 rags last month
 
 
 Yeah    I sprayed it all over my rear drive shaft housing and it didnt
 seem to make it any quieter at all 

Didnt you read the instructions first
Youre supposed to spray it in your ears so you wont be
distracted by the chainnoise of the other bikes around you
Thats why its called Chain Wax
