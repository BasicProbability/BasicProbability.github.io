Subject Re BMW Nostalgia Question from a Neophyte
From vechRaMsStateEdu Craig A Vechorik

To go one step further you could write Roland Slabon Pres of the
Vintage BMW Motorcycle Owners Ltd at PO box 67 Exeter New Hampshire 
03833 and hell send you copy of the bimonthly rag with info as to where
to send your 12 bucks if ya want to join As far as the price of 60s
Beemers it varies wildly from a low of around 1000 for an unrestored
bike that still runs like an R50 or R60 to 4500 or so for a restored
R69S  Dont listen to that bull about the old bmws not being good 
enough to ride in todays world Hell Im riding my 1956 R26 Single
from Mississippi to the BMW MOA national rally in Oshkosh Wisconsin
on the 22nd of July this year
