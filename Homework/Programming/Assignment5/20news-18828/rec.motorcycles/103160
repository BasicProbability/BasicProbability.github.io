time debating with someone on why i push the right handle of my motorcycle
foward when i am turning leftand i cant explain well at least why this

 Ummm if you push on the right handle of your bike while at speed and
your bike turns left methinks your bike has a problem  When I do it

Really

Methinks somethings wrong with your bike

Perhaps you meant pull

Pushing the right side of my handlebars will send me left

It should 
REally

on MY bike I turn right  No wonder you need that FAQ  If I had it
Id send it


Im sure others will take up the slack






 
Andy Infante   I sometimes wish that people would put a little more emphasis 
71 BMW R605  upon the observance of the law than they do upon its          
DoD 2426      enforcement  Calvin Coolidge                                 
 My opinions dammit have nothing to do with anyone else
