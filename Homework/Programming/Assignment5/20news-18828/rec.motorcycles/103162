Castrol Syntec does not contain teflon it gets its greater
lubrication by bonding to the metal surfaces of the engine 
thus making the metal ride on the polymer rather
than having metaltometal contact I do not know if this 
also reduces the acid contact with the metal but it seems 
likely

Just becase something forms a resin does not mean that
its not teflon based  The PTFE in slick50 is not teflon
either but its still teflon based  

Teflon is a DuPontowned tradename for PTFE  Slick50 does
indeed use DuPont Teflon though some other brands of such
stuff may use imported PTFE of another brand

Teflon being a tradename should always by capitalized

DuPont disclaims any benefits of PTFE in the oil supply of internal 
combustion engines BTW
