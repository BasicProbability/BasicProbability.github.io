Would someone please post the countersteering FAQi am having this awful


 Ummm if you push on the right handle of your bike while at speed and
your bike turns left methinks your bike has a problem  When I do it

Really

Methinks somethings wrong with your bike

Perhaps you meant pull

Pushing the right side of my handlebars will send me left

It should 
REally

on MY bike I turn right  No wonder you need that FAQ  If I had it
Id send it

Im sure others will take up the slack


 
Andy Infante   I sometimes wish that people would put a little more emphasis 


Oh lord  This is where I came in

Obcountersteer  For some reason Ive discovered that pulling on the
wrong side of the handlebars rather than pushing on the other wrong
side if you get my meaning provides a feeling of greater control  For
example rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
right Hi Lonny pulling on the left side at least until I get leaned
over to the right feels more secure and less counterintuitive  Maybe
I need psychological help

Obcountersteer v20Anyone else find it ironic that in the weekendanda
night MSF class they dont mention countersteering until after the
first day of riding
