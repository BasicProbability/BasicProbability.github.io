 Alan nothing personal but I object to the we all in that statement
 I was on many of those rides that Alan is describing  Pushing the
 envelope does not necessarily equal taking insane chances

Moreover if two riders are riding together at the same speed
one might be riding well beyond his abilities and the other
may have a safety margin left

Oh come on Phil  Youre an excellent rider but you still take plenty of
chances  Dont tell me that its just your skill that keeps you from 
getting wacked  Theres a lot of luck thrown in there too  Youre a very
good rider and a very lucky one too  Hope your luck holds 

Allan I know the circumstances of several of your falls
On the ride when you fell while I was next behind you
you made an error of judgement by riding too fast when
you knew the road was damp and you reacted badly when
you were surprised by an oncoming car  That crash was
due to factors that were subject to your control

I wont deny that theres a combination of luck and skill
involved for each of us but it seems that youre blaming
bad luck for more of your own pain than is warranted
