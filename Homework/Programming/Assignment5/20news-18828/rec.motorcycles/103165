	I am looking for advice on what bikes I should check out  I
am 64 tall and find my legships uncomfortably bent on most of
the bikes I have ridden not many admittedly  Are there any bikes
out there built for a taller rider

Theres plenty of legroom on the Kawasaki KLR650  A bit
short in the braking department for spirited street riding
but enough for dirt and for lessagressive street stuff
