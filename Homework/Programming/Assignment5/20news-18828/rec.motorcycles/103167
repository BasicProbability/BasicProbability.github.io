Sure  Ive never been much of a racerboy as anybody whos attended the
Minibike Spectacular can attest    I get a great deal of satisfaction
in riding fast yet now so fast as to be overly concerned about not being
able to maintain a clean line  And while Im still known to slide the
occasional tire I much prefer to stay just to the sticky side of that
line  Ive found that I dont heal as well as I used to in days of yore

BTW hows the knee

mrbTires road surface and rider ability are a much more important criteria
