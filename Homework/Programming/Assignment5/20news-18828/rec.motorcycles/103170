  I had planned to get an HD this yearbut instead I
 took delivery on a brand new male offspringer last Monday
 
 Sounds like you should have been doing your planning LAST year given
 HarleyDavidsons product delivery lag and the human gestation cycle

Or perhaps any planning at all    Hiya Pete still got that CBX
Nice to hear from you again

 And yes I finally did figure out why this happens and I have
 taken steps to ensure a storkish repetition
 
 That would be low drag bars and way rad rearsets for the FJ so that the 
 ergonomic constraints would have contraceptive consequences

Ouch    This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the er step function
provided when the riders body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesnt  I think its really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBR900RR and the GTS1000A
