Riding to work last week via Hwy 12 from Suisun to I80 I was pulled over by
a CHP black and white by the 76 Gas station by Jameson Canyon Road  The
officer stated it looked like you were going kinda fast coming down
highway 12  You must have been going at least 70 or 75  I just said okay
and did not agree or disagree to anything he said 

  Can you beat this ticket  Personally I think its your Duty As a Citizen
to make it as much trouble as possible for them so maybe theyll Give Up
and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon
  The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
your speed  Mr Brown the author of Fight Your Ticket mentions an
Oakland judge who convicted a speeder on the officers testimony that
the drivers car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed
  You can pay off the State and your insurance company or you can
take it to court and be creative  Personally Ive never won that way
or seen anyone win but the judge always listens politely  And I havent
seen that many attempts
  You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the
cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing they therefore
appear to be further away and so their speed appears to be greater than
it actually is  I left out a step or two but you get the idea  If you
can make it convincing theoretically youre supposed to win
  Ive never tried proving the cop was mistaken  I did get to see
some other poor biker try it  He was mixing up various facts like
the maximum acceleration of a cop car and the distance at which
the cop had been pacing him and end up demonstrating that he couldnt
possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested  Hed
brought diagrams and a calculator  He was Prepared  He lost  Keep
in mind cops do this all the time and their word is better than yours
Maybe though they dont guess how fast bikes are going all the time
Besides this guy didnt speak English very well and ended up absolutely
confounding the judge the cop and everyone else in the room whod been
recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota
  Ahem  OK Im better now  Maybe hed have won had his presentation
been more polished  Maybe not  He did get applause
