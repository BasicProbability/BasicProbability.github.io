I propose that the Official DoD Newbie Bike of Choice tm be the ZX11 D

8  Nothing like giving newbies a land rocket to practice on  

It offers
enough power so that a novice rider can safely  accelerate out of harms way
in situations where a more experienced rider would use complex avoidance 
manouvers

Yup  Accelerate right into the back of an 18wheel truck

Um  Hows the easiest way to get newbies of the road
