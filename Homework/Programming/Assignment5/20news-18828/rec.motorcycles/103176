they way I want it to  However I have the following problem  My chin hangs
out from the bottom of the helmet  I am curious to know whether I would still
have this problem if I were to switch to the extra large size  In particular
can anyone tell me for certain if the outer shell of the Arai QuantumS in
size Xlarge is any different largerrounderetc than the same helmet in size
large  Or if the inner paddingfoam on the Xlarge is such that ones head
fits a little deeper in the helmet and thus ones chin would not stick out
This is true for the very old ArthurFulmer helmets that I have  Namely my
chin hangs out a little from the bottom of the Large helmet and not at all
from the Xlarge but the Xlarge is not as snug as the large  The dealer
is willing to replace the helmet at no additional cost ie shipping but
I want to make sure that 1 the Xlarge is in fact a little bigger or linered
such that my chin will not hang out and 2 how much looser will my head fit in
the Xlarge  If anyone has recent experience with this helmet please let me
hear Email from you ASAP  Thank you so much  Amir

Im not sure about the helmet but for chin questions you might
want to write to a
