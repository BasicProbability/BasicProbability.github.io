   Can you beat this ticket  Personally I think its your Duty As a Citizen
 to make it as much trouble as possible for them so maybe theyll Give Up
 and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon
   The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing
 your speed  Mr Brown the author of Fight Your Ticket mentions an
 Oakland judge who convicted a speeder on the officers testimony that
 the drivers car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed

cough choke  WHAT  if a cop gave me a ticket for sounding like
i was speeding id probably show up in court without a lawyer simply
because sounding like speeding is ridiculous  if i was found guilty
id appeal and then show up with a lawyer

if a cop doesnt do one of

VASCAR from car or plane
RADAR LIDAR other electronic speed measuring device
pace me

and im within 15mph or so of the limit id go to court  i can accept a
cop seeing me going excessively fast like 25 over the limit but
he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone is not beyond a
reasonable doubt  granted i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measured
by eye  take it to court for sure
