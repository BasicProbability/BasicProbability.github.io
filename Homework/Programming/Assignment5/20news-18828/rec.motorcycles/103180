 That would be low drag bars and way rad rearsets for the FJ so that the 
 ergonomic constraints would have contraceptive consequences

Ouch    This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
Hurt Study   Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy Hurt et al recommended
that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the er step function
provided when the riders body slides off of the seat and onto the
gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
rider doesnt  I think its really inspiring how the manufacturers
have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
CBR900RR and the GTS1000A

I dunno on my old GS1000E the tankseat junction was nice and smooth
But if you were to travel all the way forward youd collect the top
tripleclamp in a sensitive area Id hate to have to make the choice
but I think Id prefer the FJs gas tank
