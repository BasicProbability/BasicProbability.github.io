Subject Re Speeding ticket from CHP

Interesting  Id fight the ticket  First off theres a 5050 chance
the cop wont show up  Secondly if he does show up you should point
out that he lied purgered on the ticket  Why 70  I beleive that if
yore charged with going more than 15mph that the posted speed its a
more severe ticket  You couldnt have possibly been going 70 right
