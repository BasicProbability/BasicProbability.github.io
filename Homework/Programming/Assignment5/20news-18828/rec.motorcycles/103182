From pnakadaoraclecom Paul Nakada
Subject Eating and Riding was Re Drinking and Riding


Whats the feeling about eating and riding  I went out riding this
weekend and got a little carried away with some pecan pie  The whole
ride back I felt sluggish  I was certainly much more alert on the
ride in  Im sure others have the same feeling but the strangest
thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides

From now on a little snack will do  Id much rather have a get that
fullsluggish feeling closer to home
