 From the summary in the back of Motorcyclist they run the 14 in
 1307 at about 100 mph Interestingly enough this Winnebago of bikes
 is faster than any of the Harleys listed 

  It depreciates much faster too

The 84 GL1200A hit the traps at 1334 according to Cycle magazine Yeah
they depreciate faster than Harleys for the first couple of years then
they bottom out Got my 86 GL1200I w 2275 miles on the odometer for
just under 5K in May of 1990 and would ask for 4500 now with almost
16K miles onnitthats about 50 of what a new GL1500I would cost

Think the 86 GL1200I originally sold for 6500 brand new not sure 
If thats the case then it depreciated 3077 over 7 years or a mere
2000 Big Fat Hairy Deal Based on what I know Harleys tend to
depreciate your monies far more than the initial depreciation of
the bike itself when it comes to parts and service All this about
Harleys holding their value better doesnt always wash away the
knocks on themsuch as being much slower  

According to Peter Egan in the just released Cycle World his FLHS is a
real dog when he pillions his 120lb wife All that money for a dog that
doesnt defecate much
