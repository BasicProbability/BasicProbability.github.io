It depends on how badly you want to live  The FAA says eight hours bottle
to throttle for pilots but recommends twentyfour hours  The FARs specify
a bloodalcohol level of 04 as legally drunk I think which is more than
twice as strict as DWI minimums

BTW alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate  one beerhour will
keep your bloodalcohol level barely streetlegal  Coffee hyperventilation
and other bar tricks wont speed it up nor will they fool Mr Ranger
