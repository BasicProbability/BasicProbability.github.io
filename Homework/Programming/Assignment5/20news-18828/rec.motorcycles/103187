Subject  Fork Seals 

Im about to undertake changing the fork seals on my 88 EX500  My Clymer
manual says I need the following tools from Kawasaki

57001183  T handle looking thing in illustration
570011057 Some type of adapter for the end of the T handle
570011091 No illustration of this tool and the manual just refers to it
           as the kawasaki tool
570011058 Oil seal and bearing remover

How necessary are these tools  Considering the dealers around here didnt
have the Clymer manual fork seals and a turn signal assembly in stock I
really doubt they have these tools in stock and Id really like to get this
done this week   Any help would be appreciated as always
