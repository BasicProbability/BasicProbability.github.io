 I think Ive found the ultimate summer job Its dangerous involves
 motorcycles requires high speeds in traffic and it pays well
 
 So my question is as follows Has anyone here done this sort of work
 What was your experience
 
Stuff deleted
   Get a good AtoZ type indexed streetmap for all of the areas  youre
   likely to work   Always carry  plenty of blackplastic  bin liners  to

Check with the local fire department  My buddy is a firefighter and they
have these small map books which are Amazing  They are compact easy to
use no folding  They even have a cross reference section in which you
match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to
and it details the quickest route  They gave me an extra they had laying
around  But then again I know all those people Im not really sure if they
are supposed to givesell them The police may also have something
similar
