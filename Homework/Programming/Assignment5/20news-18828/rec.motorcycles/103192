   What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling Couple hours 
  after you feel sober What Or should I just work with If I drink 
  tonight I dont ride until tomorrow
 
 1 hrdrink for the first 4 drinks
 15 hoursdrink for the next 6 drinks
 2 hoursdrink for the rest

I took an alcohol servers class a few years ago  What the hey my employer
paid for it

We were told that the 1 drink  hour rule was written with 80 proof booze
and a 195 pound person in mind  Drinking Cuervo Gold weighing in  140
I obviously will get drunk faster than the theoretical person mentioned
above  Worse imagine Rum  coke made with Bacardi 151

Mind you all thats for getting too drunk to drive a car  I may only
have been riding for a month or so but I plan my evenings with a very
rigid exclusive or statement Either dont drink or dont ride
Pretty simple

 
 These are fairly cautious guidelines and will work even if you happen to 
 have a low tolerance or body mass
 I think the cops and Dont You Dare Drink  Drive tm commercials will 
 usually say 1hrdrink in general but after about 5 drinks and 5 hrs you 
 could very well be over the legal limit 
 Watch yourself
 Mike

Sorry mike I have to believe that that policy works best as fertilizer
even if all you plan to do is drive home nice and safe in your cage
