first I thought it was an RC31 a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it  Additionally

I think Ive seen this bike  Is it all white with a seagreen stripe
and just HONDA for decals Ive seen such a bike numerous times over
by Sewall hall at CU and I thought it was a raceprepped CBR 
I didnt see it over at the EC parking lot I buzzed over there on my 
way home all of 12 block off my route  but it was gone

Is a single sided swingarm available for the CBR  I would imagine so 
kinda neccisary for quick tire changes  When I first saw it I assumed it
was a bike repainted to cover crash damage
