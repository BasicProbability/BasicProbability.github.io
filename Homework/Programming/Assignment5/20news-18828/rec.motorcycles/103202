 The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike given
 the metal frame and all I have a big backrest approx 12 high and
 was hoping that I would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest

 Any one have any experiences on such experimentation

Put the pack on the pillion and bungee it to the backrest
If that is not possible then you should be able to bungee it behind the
backrest just make sure it doesnt bend or break anything like the rear
fender or turnsignals

 Cars making a sudden Uturn are the most dangerous  They may cut you off  
  entirely blocking the whole roadway and leaving you no place to go
