 By the way the shortlived Zephyr is essentially a GpZ 550

Why was the Zephyr discontinued  I heard something about a problem with
the name but I never did hear anything certain 

Ford had an anemic midsized car by that name back in the last decade
I rented one once  That car would ruin the name Zephyr for any other
use
