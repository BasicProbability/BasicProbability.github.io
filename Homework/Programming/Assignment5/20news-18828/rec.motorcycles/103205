Subject Re Thoughts on a 1982 Yamaha Seca Turbo

I was wondering if anybody knows anything about a Yamaha Seca Turbo  Im 
considering buying a used 1982 Seca Turbo for 1300 Canadian 1000 US
with 30000 km on the odo  This will be my first bike  Any comments

	Dont just nab it POUNCE on it  These are fairly rare bikes and
they are MORE than adequate for putting a big brown stripe in your shorts
Does a 50mph power wheelie appeal to you  I thought it would

	Only really bad things  the stock clutch isnt up to the task
Barnett can take care of this  The back tire wears quickly gee wonder why
and the induction system is a bear to work on
