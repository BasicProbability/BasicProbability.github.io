	While were on the subject has anyone else noticed that the 12 deep
well in Craftsmans 60 SAE deep well set is too small to fit a 12 bolt or
nut

	When I took the socket in for an exchange EVERY  one of the 12
deep well sockets on the rack had the exact same problem  Looking into the
socket it appears that Craftsmans toolmaker attempted to imitate flank drive
on this piece but did not account for the extra clearance needed inside the
socket

Never had any problem with mine

Are you SURE the nutbolt you are trying is really a 12 hex  13mm
is just slightly larger  and a 12 wrench wont fit on a GM 13mm
nut my 91 GMC pickup has several 13mm nuts on it  really annoying metric
threads too  Seems that most of the body is metric most of the engine is
SAE
