 Hey it works You could present the paragraph above to virtually any member
 of the nonmotorcycling public and theyll buy right into it
 
 Just about any argument you can produce in favor of banning helmetless
 riding can be used to argue in favor of banning motorcycles
 Its just a matter of degree

Thats absurd That statement must therefore say that any argument in favor
of seatbelts or airbags is an argument against automobiles  Any argument
for lifeguards is an argument against swimming  It says that any agrgument
in favor of safety precautions is an argument for banning the activity to 
which the precautions apply  Extrapolating to that degree is ridiculous
there wouldnt be any normal human activity left to do therefore it is
a nonseqitur

Also even though most people do not ride motorcycles they do boat sail
jetski climb ski fly parachute hangglide glide bungeejump bike
skate rollerblade skateboard play rugby ouch mow the lawn rewire
the basement operate heavy machinery  and do a host of other dangerous
things that would all be as valid as motorcycling as activities to ban
Your little homily applies to all those things and the general public
buying into banning motorcycles without realizing that their activity
would be next is unlikely
