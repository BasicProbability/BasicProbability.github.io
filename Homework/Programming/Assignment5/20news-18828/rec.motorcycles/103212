put pistons in bores first then lower onto bottom end deleted

Has anybody actually carried out this procedure  I can visualize fewer
problems with canting pistons in the cylinders with this method but
more trouble with keeping the bores suspended especially for the first
two pistons and with working space to insert piston pins and clips
especially for the last two pistons

    It is certainly possible and quite easy in most cases especially
on twostrokes  Its very common to do this on bikes where the
cylindermounting throughstuds dont prevent the cylinder from being
removed with the engine in the frame
    I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian which was
easier yet because it does not have throughstuds  Base flange studs
and separate head bolts dontchaknow
    You have to use a little foresight rags duct tape etc to keep
clips from falling in clothespins hoseclamps etc to support the
cylinder while youre inserting the pins
    Are these called Gudgeon Pins in the UK If so whats a Gudgeon
