Power hmmmmmm well I havent got it on the dyno or jetted waiting for the snow
to melt Although I have a Factory jet kit  4 advancejets are 145s the stock
is 140 my book says 130 Calif 150 UK strange I dont want to fit it unless
there is a dyno handy

  Ive heard that bikes tuned to perfection on the Dyno can be a little
too close to the edge for street use Cold morning bad gas etc

  Apparently they back them of some even for track use 

 You pays your money
