drinking  riding
 It depends on how badly you want to live  The FAA says eight hours bottle
 to throttle for pilots but recommends twentyfour hours  The FARs specify
 a bloodalcohol level of 04 as legally drunk I think which is more than
 twice as strict as DWI minimums

020 is DWI in New York  Here the limit is 008
