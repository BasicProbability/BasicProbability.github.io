I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor

No accident but my eyes were tearing so hard and I was wheezing
so loudly that its quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up

The duck BTW lived and seemed quite healthy though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button
