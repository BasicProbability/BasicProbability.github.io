	When I got my knee rebuilt I got back on the street bike ASAP I put
the crutches on the rack and the passenger seat and they hung out back a
LONG way Just make sure theyre tied down tight in front and no problemo
 
	Hmm sounds like a useful trick  itd keep the local cagers at least
a crutchlength off my taillight which is more than they give me now  But
do I have to break a leg to use it

	When I broke my ankle dirtbiking I ended up strapping the crutches
to the back of the bike  riding to the lab  It was my right ankle but the
bike was a GT380 and started easily by hand
