Subject Re Drinking and Riding


So you cant ride the bike but you will drive truck home The
judgement and motor skills needed to pilot a moto are not required in a
cage This scares the sht out of me
  
This is a piece of psychology its essential for any long term biker to
understand People do NOT think if I do this will someone else suffer
They assess things purely on if I do this will I suffer

This is a vital concept in bikecage interaction
