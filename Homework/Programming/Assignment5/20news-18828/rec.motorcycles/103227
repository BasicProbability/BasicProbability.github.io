Whats the feeling about eating and riding  I went out riding this
weekend and got a little carried away with some pecan pie  The whole
ride back I felt sluggish  I was certainly much more alert on the
ride in  Im sure others have the same feeling but the strangest
thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides

From now on a little snack will do  Id much rather have a get that
fullsluggish feeling closer to home

To maintain my senses at their sharpest I never eat a full meal
within 24 hrs of a ride   Ive tried Slim Fast Lite before a 
ride but found that my lap times around the Parliament Buildings suffered 
01 secs   The resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer
just sharpens my bikes handling and I can always look
forward to a winter of carboloading
