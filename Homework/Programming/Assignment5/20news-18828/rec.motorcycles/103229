how do the helmetless do it

Um the same way people do it on 
horseback

not as fast and they would probably enjoy eating bugs anyway

Every bit as fast as a dirtbike in the right terrain  And we eat
flies thank you

Who mentioned dirtbikes Were talking highway speeds here If you go 70mph
on your dirtbike then feel free to contribute

jeeps

youre supposed to keep the windscreen up

then why does it go down

Because it wouldnt be a Jeep if it didnt A friend of mine just bought one
and it has more warning stickers than those little 4wheelers I guess thats
becuase its a big 4 wheeler Anyway its written in about ten places that
the windshield should remain up at all times and it looks like theyve made
it a pain to put it down anyway from what he says To be fair I do admit
that it would be a similar matter to drive a windscreenless Jeep on the 
highway as for bikers They may participate in this discussion but theyre
probably few and far between so I maintain that this topic is of interest
primarily to bikers

snow skis

NO BUGS and most poeple who go fast wear goggles

So do most helmetless motorcyclists

Notice how Ed picked on the more insignificant the lower case part of the 
two parts of the statement Besides around here it is quite rare to see 
bikers wear goggles on the street Its either full face with shield or 
open face with either nothing or aviator sunglasses My experience of 
bicycling with contact lenses and sunglasses says that nonwraparound 
sunglasses do almost nothing to keep the crap out of ones eyes

The question still stands How do cruiser riders with no or negligible helmets
stand being on the highway at 75 mph on buggy summer evenings

helmetless  goggleless

Ok ok fine whatever you say but lets make some attmept to stick to the
point Ive been out on the road where I had to stop every half hour to clean
my shield there were so many bugs and my jacket would be a bloodsplattered
mess and Id see guys with shorty helmets NO GOGGLES long beards and tight
tshirts merrily cruising along on bikes with no windscreens Lets be really
specific this time so that even Ed understands Does anbody think that 
splattering bugs with ones face is fun or are there other reasons to do it
Image Laziness To make a point about freedom of bug splattering

Ive        bike                      like        Jody Levine  DoD 275 kV
