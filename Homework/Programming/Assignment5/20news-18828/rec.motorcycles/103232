Subject Riding Jacket Recommendations

My old jacket is about to bite the dust so Im in the market for a new riding
jacket  Im looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement  I would
like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I cant afford 700 for it right now

Im considering two basic options

1  Buy the Aerostich jacket only  Dunno how much it costs
    due to recent price increases but Id imagine over 400
    That may be pushing my limit  Advantages include the fact
    that I can later add the pants and that it nearly eliminates
    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit

2  Buy some kind of leather jacket  I like a few of the new 
    HeinGericke FirstGear line however they may be a bit pricey
    unless I can work some sort of deal  Advantages of leather
    are potentially slightly better protection enhanced pose
    value we all know how important that is  possibly cheaper
    than upper Aerostich

Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
layers mainly a sizing thing if leather id prefer a zipout 
lining it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich elbows 
shoulders forearms possibly backkidney protection etc a 
reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice ventilation would 
be a plus however it must be wearable in cold weather below
freezing with layers or perhaps electrics

Please fire away with suggestions comments etc
