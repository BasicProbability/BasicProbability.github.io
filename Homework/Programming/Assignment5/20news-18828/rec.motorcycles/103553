 ADDITIONAL NOTES 
   This is a not for profit event and riders DO get their monies worth
   Whether youve ever attended a rally before or not This is the one
   to make  The only problem has been that there are so
   many activities that attendees have to choose one over another

   Quincy is a beautiful campground lots of grass and little dust
   For folks who have been to previous 49er rallies at Mariposa 
   Quincy has lots of space all of it flat so room is not a problem
   There are buildings and such available if there is a change in the weather
   Also the people of Quincy are going all out to welcome us 
   Registration will begin on thursday  Of course there are always early
   arrivals who will show up monday or tuesday  The registration fee pays
   for camping Thursday through Monday 5 days  There will be a tour Friday
   with the main events beginning Saturday  Sunday Evening will be the
   awards ceremony  

   For members of the various clubs club awards will be based on 
   registration declaration of affilitation  There will of course
   be the usual awards for oldest male and female rider  betting 70 
   needed to win and youngest rider  they get cheater permits at 15
   and greatest distance one up  two up and all the usual things
