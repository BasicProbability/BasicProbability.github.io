I tend to keep my bedroom window open during the winter and have woken
up to find frost on my bedspread but I still get cold below about
30F  Usually on the part that sticks out of the bottom of my helmet
Maybe its time to get a NOJ quiet rider

Cool  I conjure up this image of BD in Doonesburyso Dean how long 
have you been sleeping with your helmet on
