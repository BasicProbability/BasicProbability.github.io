my solution is never to ride next to a car

The only thing between you and them is space
Keep as much as possible

Take this one step further 

Never dillydally in that rear 14 of either side of a cage  when you pass
make it as POSITIVE as possible and if you cant pass fully at least make
sure that if you attempt it you can make the driver aware of you by at least
getting into his area of vision

This also applies to merging into another lane after making a pass  do it
as POSITIVELY as possible  and what I try to do is look in the rear view
and then over my shoulder  And after Ive done that ACCELERATE into the 
lane so that you have a speed cushion should you have missed seeing a 
potential BDI thats trying to do the same thing as you  or worse ie
he may have been behind you saw you made the pass successfully but YOU arent
GOING FAST ENOUGH to suite him so he tries to go around you on the right

Ride with four eyes

Rich
