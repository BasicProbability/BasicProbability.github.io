Subject Observation re helmets

 
 Grf Dropped my Shoei RF200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock 
it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it
 
 So I cheerfully spent 59 on a bottle of testors model paint and 
repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes
 
 Then while it was drying I realized that I was out of smokes and that my 
cage is not currently running So I had to take my bike down to the 
store Not wanting to mess up my paint job I said Well heck I can just 
use my old helmet this is your standard el cheapie openface 
  
 I didnt notice a big difference when I switched TO the shoei but 
switching back was really bad 
 
 1 Doesnt fit worth a damn too wide in the sides too short front to 
back
 2 With a faceplate its still bloody windy with the shoei I normally 
ignore the face shield until I get up to about 30ish with this one 
taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind 
 
  
 
 The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you dont know for 
certain whos gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church 
meeting yeah thats the ticket What are some guidelines Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger
