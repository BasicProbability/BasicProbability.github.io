Subject Flashing anyone

Hello all

On my bike I have hazard lights both front and back turn signals
flash  Since I live in NJ and commute to NYC there are a number of
tolls one must pay on route  Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the 2 12 seconds to make the transaction
Taking gloves off getting money out of coin changerpocket making
transaction putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll
I also notice that when I do this cagers tend to get the message and
usually go to another booth

My question is this a goodbad thing to do

Any others tend to do the same

Just curious
