   Watch out  Often when some scumbag steals the cover that means
   that they were or are looking to steal the bike  In my case I
   had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R100RS that was stashed in an
   apartment carport and not visible from the street  They evidently
   decided the beemer wasnt worth stealing but did try the next night to
   steal a Honda Hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building
   A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops


I know this is just setting myself up but this is actually one of the
things that is really good about BMW bikes  From all accounts Ive
heard practically no one steals BMWs Probably it is similar for Moto
Guzzis and other relative exotics since there isnt a large demand
for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down It seems
that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes
