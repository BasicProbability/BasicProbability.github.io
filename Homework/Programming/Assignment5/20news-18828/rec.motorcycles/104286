 Has anyone ever heard of a rider giving a big dog such as a great dane a ride 
 on the back of his bike  My dog would love it if I could ever make it work

 Post of the month 
Actually Ive seen riders carting around a pet dog in a sidecar
A great Dane on the back though sounds a bit hairy to me

Yeah Im sure that our lab would love a ride hes the type that sticks his
head out car windows but I didnt think that he would enjoy being bungee
corded to the gas tank and 65 lbs or squirming beast is a bit much for a
backpack ok whos done it
