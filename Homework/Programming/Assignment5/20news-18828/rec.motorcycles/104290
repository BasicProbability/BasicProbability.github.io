My mechanic once commented that the dual range transmission was
pure junk One mans opinion


	I had a friend in Pittsburgh who had a CB1000C with the dualrange
tranny on it  He usually only used the economy range to get an overdrive
sixth gear out of it  He had 59000 miles on it when it was stolen  It was
recovered shortly after that repaired and for all I know its still going
strong

	The CB1000C was a shaftdriven overbore version of the CB900 and was
made for exactly one year yep head and base gaskets are VERY expensive
Helluva bike

A data point
