hello there
ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
comment on its handling 

Ive ridden one twice It was designed to be a monster in a straight line
which it is It has nothing on an FZR400 in the corners In fact it just
didnt handle that well at all in curves But hey thats not what it
was designed to do
My two cents
