 Does the amount of exhaust allowed to leave the engine through the
 exhaust pipe make that much of a difference the amount of airfuel
 mixture that a cylender sucks in tries to suck in depends on the
 speed of the piston when it goes down 

 and the pressure in the cylinder at the end of the exhaust stroke

 With a poor exhaust system this pressure may be above atmospheric
 With a pipe that scavenges well this may be substantially below
 atmospheric  This effect will vary with rpm depending on the tune of
 the pipe some pipes combined with large valve overlap can actually
 reverse the intake flow and blow mixture out of the carb when outside
 the pipes effective rev range

 Now my question is which one provides more resistence as far as the
 engine is conserned
  resistance that the exhaust provides 
  or the resistance that results from the bike trying to push itself and
   the rider

 Two completely different things  The state of the pipe determines how
 much power the motor can make  The load of the bike determines how
 much power the motor needs to make

Well I for one am so very glad that I have fuel injection  All those 
needles and orifices and venturi and pressures Its worse than school human
biology reproduction lessons sex  Always made me feel a bit queasy
