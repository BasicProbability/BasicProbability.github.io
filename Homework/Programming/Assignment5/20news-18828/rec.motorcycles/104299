 Lets get this No Fault stuff straight I lived in NJ
 when NF started my rates went up ALOT Moved to PA
 and my rates went down ALOT the NF came to PA and it
 was a different story If you are sitting in a parking
 lot having lunch or whatever and someone wacks you guess
 whose insurance pays for it  give up   YOURS

BZZZT If it is the other drivers fault your insurance co pays you less
deductible then recoups the total cost from the other guygals company
theres a fancy word for it which escapes me right now and pays you the
deductible Or you can go to the other guygals company right off  just
takes longer to get your cash as opposed to State Farm who cut me a check
today on the spot for the damage to my wifes cage

	The word is subrogation  Seems to me if youre willing to wait
for the money from scumbags insurance that you save having to pay the
deductible  However if scumbags insurance is Scum insurance then you may
have to pay the deductible to get your insurance cos pack of rabid large
fanged lawyers to recover the damages from Scum insurances lawyers

	Sad but true  Call it job security for lawyers
