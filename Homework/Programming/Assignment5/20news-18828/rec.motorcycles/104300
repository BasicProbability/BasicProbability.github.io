Has anyone ever heard of a rider giving a big dog such as a great dane a ride 
on the back of his bike  My dog would love it if I could ever make it work
	Thanks

On the back might be tricky but here in Boulder there is a guy 
that can always be seen with his Golden Retriever in the sidecar
Of course the dog is always wearing WWII style goggles no joke
