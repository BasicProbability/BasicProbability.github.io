 Thanks to everyone who posted in my previous quest for camping info

 Another question 
 Well not strictly rm stuff

 I am looking for a thermosflask to keep coffee hot I mean real
 hot Of course it must be the unbreakable type So far what ever
 metal type I have wasted money on has not matched the vacuumglass 
 type

 Any info appreciated

 Sanjay


Back in my youth ahem the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
water from a 12V source  It was for car use but we thought wed try it on my
RD350B  It worked OK apart from one slight problem we had to keep the revs 
above 7000  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement

It made for interesting cups of coffee anyhow  We would plot routes that
contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
get the water to boiling point  This is sometimes difficult in England

Good luck on your quest
