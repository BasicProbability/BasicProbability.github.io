 If I remember correctly the reason that BMWs come with those expensive
 and relatively worthless short lived Varda batteries is cause BMW owns
 a controling interest in that battery Manufacturer                 

 Whats wrong with the BMW battery Ive never had problems and I know
 numerous people that are still using the original battery in there
 810 year old beemers


Kay my 86 K100RS still has her original battery in  Shes OK
