Can someone tell me what a deltabox frame is and what relation that has
if any to the frame on my Hawk GT  That way next time some guy comes up
to me in some parking lot and sez hey dude nice bike is that a deltabox
frame on there I can say something besides duh er huh

   Deltabox tm is a registered trademark of Yamaha used to describe
their aluminum perimeter frame design used on the FZR400 and FZR1000
In crosssection it has a fivesided appearance so it probably really
should be called a Pentabox
