Subject Tickets  advice is worth what you paid

I cant think of another subject that generates as much contradictory
advice as traffic laws and their enforcement  Everybodys got an
opinion and is dead certain they are right  Yet acurate information is
extremely difficult to come by  The DMV doesnt know  Cops dont
know  Your traffic school instructor doesnt know  The vehicle code
only tells part of the story  Judges choose to interpret the laws in a
wide variety of ways  And the public at large  I seldom hear any
advice that doesnt disagree with something Ive experienced

If you dont believe me I suggest you get a copy of the vehicle code
study it and then sit in on a day or two of court and see what really
happens  Read Fight Your Ticket too but dont miss the little
section at the end where it says your chances are lousy and youre
basically screwed

As you may have guessed Im pretty down on the system here in
California  Ive carefully prepared for court bringing witnesses and
revealing serious holes in the officers story only to be slapped with
the maximum allowable fine plus assessments of over 100  the
message clear that the judge does not appreciate John Q Public trying
his own cases

So heres my advice when you find yourself with a ticket  Take traffic
school if you can  If its a serious matter get a lawyer  A lawyer
can present the exact same case as you the difference is the
sentence
