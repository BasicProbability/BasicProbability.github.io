 PS When you showin up at Highland House Well compare sunglasses

Lets see how the weather is Saturday or Sunday It sucks
today What time is good
Youre welcome to give any of the ones I have a try  As
for the gargoyles if you want mine you can have em  I
think the bridge of my nose holds them too far from my face
Same deal for the two of my friends who tried them For
people who use them with a full face helmet all bets are
off Sorry if they fit you well and took my complaint
personally Yes the Oakleys are much more desirable squid
attire Also the gargoyles arent that ugly even in my
opinion or I wouldnt have tried them
