Oh yeah 1210 at 108 mph in the quarter is such a slug  Come on when was
the last time you used your 750s max power peak  I think maybe you should
ride one first before passing judgement there is a lot more than just
maximum acceleration 

I really didnt mean to imply that my Ninja was any better than a Duc  
I have to talked to a few Duc owners 750SS owners in particular who
say that the power is something less than overwhelming  That said
I would love to have a 900SS  I guess I should have been a bit more
specific  If you have something that weighs that same as the 750 go 
for the extra cubes  

I think that fact that I own a GTV6 shows that I dont care about maximum
power its no slug though to the exclusion of everything else  The note 
and the handling are more important to me  I just bought a Ninja because I 
couldnt afford a Duc

Didnt mean to ruffle any feathers Ill probably be getting a 900SS next
year
