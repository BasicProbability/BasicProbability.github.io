Subject Re Drinking and Riding

Personally I follow the no alcohol rule when Im on a bike  My view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike  If I get hurt its my own fault but I dont want to wreck my Katana  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu experiment  I had one beer at 600 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 700  I wasnt even close to leagle intoxication but I couldnt perform even the most basic things until 830  This made



 me think about how I viewed alcohol and intoxication  You may seem fine but your reactions may be affected such that youll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind  I greatly enjoy social drinking but for me it just doesnt mix with riding

Max enjoyment
Eric
