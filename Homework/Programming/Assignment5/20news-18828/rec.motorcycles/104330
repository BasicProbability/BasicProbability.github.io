Subject What about NoFault


Insurance companies sure seem to go for NoFault coverage  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers fault doesnt this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a NoFault system

With a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the
legal costs out of the system  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed
