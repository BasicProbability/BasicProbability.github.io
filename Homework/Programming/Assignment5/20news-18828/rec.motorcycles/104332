  Grf Dropped my Shoei RF200 off the seat of my bike while trying to
 rock 
 it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it
  
  So I cheerfully spent 59 on a bottle of testors model paint and 
 repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes
  
  The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you dont know
 for 
 certain whos gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a 
 church 
 meeting yeah thats the ticket What are some guidelines Should
 I just 
 pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or
 should I 
 maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my
 likely 
 passenger 

   My rule of thumb is Dont give rides to people that wear
a bigger helmet than you unless your taste runs that way
or they are familyfriends
Gee  reminds me of a dancer in Hull just over the river 
from Ottowa that I saw a few years ago for her I would a
bought a bigger helmet or even her own bike or anything 
else she wanted
