Subject Re GGRRRrrr  Cages doubleparking motorcycles pisses me off

Reading all you folks things to do to illegally parked cars made me
wonder whos going to carry cinder blocks on a bike or is 
ready to do serious damage key carvings etc to a cage  Then I
had an ideachain lube isnt just for chains anymore  It seems
more reasonable to me no permanent damage but lots of work to get
off  Dont ask me how I know   Use it anywhere the windshield
the door handles in the keyhole etc  What a nasty mood Im in
Its raining again
