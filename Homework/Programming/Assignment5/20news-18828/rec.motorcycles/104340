 lots of things none of which are quoted here

The nice thing about horses though is that if they break down in the middle of
nowhere you can eat them

	And theyre rather tasty


  Fuels a bit cheaper too


	Per gallon bushel perhaps Unfortunately they eat the same amount
every day no matter how much you ride them And if you dont fuel them they
die On an annual basis I spend much less on bike stuff than Amy the Wonder
Wife does on horse stuff She has two horses Ive got umm lesseee 11 bikes
I ride constantly she rides four or five times a week Even if you count 
insurance and the cost of the garage I built Im getting off cheaper than 
she is And having more fun IMHO





 
Go fast Take chances
