Subject Re How to act in front of traffic jerks

In article 1qmvutINN3helynxunmedu galwaychtmeeceunmedu Denis McKeon writes
In heavy traffic I slow down a bit mostly so I have more buffer zone in
front to balance the minimal buffer behind but I also often find that the 
jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes switch
into one of them and pass me  which is fine because then I can keep a
better eye on the jerk from behind while looking ahead rather than
from in front while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors

This is pretty damned complicated I just make a back off motion with
my handarm and the second or third time even the most braindead cager
backs off If they dont back off then I find a way to get the hell out
of there  the cager is either psychotic drunk or just a complete
asshole In any case I dont want to be anywhere near and especially
not in front
