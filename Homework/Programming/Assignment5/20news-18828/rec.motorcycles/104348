    I need help with my 85 ZX900A I put Supertrapp slipons on it and
    had the carbs rejetted to match a set of KN filters that replaced
    the stock airbox  Now I have a huge flat spot in the carburation at
    about 5 thousand RPM in most any gear  This is especially frustrating
    on the highway the bike likes to cruise at about 80mph which happens
    to be 50000 RPM in sixth gear  Ive had it tuned and this doesnt
    seem to help  I am thinking about new carbs or the injection system
    from a GPz 1100  Does anyone have any suggestions for a fix besides
    restoring it to stock

It sound like to me that your carbs are not jetted properly
If you did it yourself take it to a shop and get it done right
If a shop did it get your money back and go to another shop
