Subject Info on SportCruisers

Im looking for a sportcruiser  factory installed fairings 
fullhalf  hard saddle bags 750cc and above and all that and still
has that sporty look

I particularly like the R100RS and K75 RT or S or any of the K series
BMW bikes

I was wondering if there are any other comparable type bikes being
produced by companies other than BMW

Thanks for the info
Jae
