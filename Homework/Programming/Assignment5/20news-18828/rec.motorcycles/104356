   Talk about Harleys using old technology these
Morgan people really like to use old technology
I think their suspension design hasnt changed since 
they went from 3 wheels to 4 back in the 50s  And its
not like they had reached the pinnacle of good design 
at that point either 

Well if you want to pick on Morgan why not attack its ash wood
frame or its handbent metal skin just try and get a replacement   
I thought the kingpost suspension was one of the Mogs better features
