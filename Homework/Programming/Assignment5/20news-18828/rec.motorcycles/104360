Most people wave or return my wave when Im on my Harley
Other Harley riders seldom wave back to me when Im on my
duck Squids dont wave or return waves ever even to each
other from what I can tell

  When we take a hand off the bars we fall down

The problem is that Squids and BadAssBikers cant recognize
each others waves  When youre riding a cruiser you wave
by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand without
first removing that hand from the handlebar  When youre
riding a crotch rocket you lower the left hand to about
ankle level palm forward and call that a wave

Generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely
off the handlebar and wave it around so its easy to tell
when theyre waving
