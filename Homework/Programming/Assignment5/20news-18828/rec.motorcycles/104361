Subject Re Lane Sharing in CA

In three years of riding in the cities of San Jose
Santa Clara and Sunnyvale I never came into any
conflict with the local police over my lane splitting
habits all three of these cities were listed earlier
as being antisplitting in one way or another  I
cant say whether this was due to luck police
kindness or there not actually being any ordinances
against it in these cities so I continue
