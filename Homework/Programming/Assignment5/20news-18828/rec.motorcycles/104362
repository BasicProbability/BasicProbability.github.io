 My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
 something Ive weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
 approved method Slow down to screw up dogs triangulation of target
 then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you This time it
 didnt work because I didnt have time Riding up the hill leading to my
 house I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
 the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
 the Spagthorpe Viking Actually the dog encountered me with intent to
 harm

interesting dog collision story deleted

 What worries me about the accident is this I dont think I could have
 prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was This is not
 necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was
 riding around the speed limit I worry about what would have happened if
 it had been a car instead of a dog but I console myself with the
 thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a
 blind driveway at 1530 mph For that matter how many driveways are
 long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end
 
 I eagerly await comment

My driveway and about half my neighbors driveways are long enough to
do a good 80 clicks 50mph for the velocity impaired if we wanted to
Granted I live in the country however Ive seen neighbors whip out
of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit they
claim they can tell that Theres noone on the road for quite a ways
This despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving
a Chev 4x4 and twice taking my 10speed bicycle over the hood of a
car that had pulled out saw me then stopped  Same driver  Same car
About two months apart  

ObMoto  The scary relevant part is that these people and I live on the type
of twisty two lane that we all favor for riding and I know damn well
that they cant see me on my bike not if they couldnt see me in 
my pickup
