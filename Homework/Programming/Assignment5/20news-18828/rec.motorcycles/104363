Well it looks like Im Fcked for insurance

I had a DWI in 91 and for the beemer as a rec
vehicle itll cost me almost 1200 bucks to insureyear

Now what do I do

Sell the bike and the car and start taking the bus That way you can
keep drinking which seems to be where your priorities lay

I expect that enough of us on this list have lost friends because of
driving drunks that our collective sympathy will be somewhat muted

Showing great restraint
