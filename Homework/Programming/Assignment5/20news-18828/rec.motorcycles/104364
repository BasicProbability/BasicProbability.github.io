I guess Im out of touch but what exactly is the Ducati 400 A vtwin
desmo or is it that halfavtwin with the balance weight where the 2nd
cylinder would go A 12 second 14 for a 400 isnt bad at all

Sorry I should have been more specific  The 750 SS ran the quater in
1210  10817  The last small Vtwin Duc we got in the US and the 400 is
a Pantah based Vtwin was the 500SL Pantah and it ran a creditable 130 
103  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105

BTW FZR 400s ran mid 12s and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that  Its hard to remember but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily both in top end and rollon  Technology stands still for
noone

Not too hard to remember I bought a GS1000 new in 78  It was
3rd place in the 78 speed wars behind the CBX  XS Eleven with a
118  113 14 mile and 75 horses That wouldnt even make a good 600
these days Then again I paid 2800 for it so technology isnt the
only thing thats changed Of course Id still rather ride the old GS
across three states than any of the 600s

I guess its an indication of how much things have changed that a 12
second 400 didnt seem too far out of line
