Subject Re Ducati 400 opinions wanted

I spoke to a sales dweeb in 3X a Ducati dealer here in Blighty and he had
nothing good to say about them it appears they are waaaay underpowered
basically its the 750900 with a 400cc engine and there have been some
quality problems rusty frame   Save your pennies buy the 900
