Subject Re BMW MOA members read this

I first heard it about academic politics but the same thought seems to
apply to the BMWMOA

The politics is so dirty because the stakes are so small

Who cares I get my duesworth from the ads and occasional technical
articles in the News I skip the generally drab articles about someones
trek across Iowa If some folks get thrilled by the power of the BMWMOA
they deserve whatever thrills their sad lives provide

BTW I voted for new blood just to keep things stirred up
