 Okay DoDers heres a goddamn mystery for ya 

Oh goody  I love a puzzle  Watson  The games afoot

 Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day but there
 was a slight difference  a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension
 to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very
 tangible thunk  I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage

 Okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   How can you
 rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without
 damaging the thread in the hole   Is this some sort of hitech design thingo

Let me guess  You were making a left turn correct  The edge of the stud
contacting the road caused it to turn and unthread itself  If you had 
been making a right turn it would have tightened the stud
