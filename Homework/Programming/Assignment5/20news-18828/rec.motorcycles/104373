edIf hes not I will  

Hey Ed you didnt give me the chance  Sheesh

The answer is absolutely as Ed so eloquently describes

edPut two riders on identical machines  Its the
edone who knows what hes doing and why that will be faster  It may
edbe possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is
edthrough trial and error but it is not very effective methodology
edOnly by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
                             
edimprove on that technique I hold that this applies to any human
edendeavor

Herein lies the key to this thread

Kindly note the difference in the responses  Ed and I are talking
about knowing riding technique while Mike is arguing knowing the physics
behind it  It is possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
ie push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way without
having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
and such as seen in the parallel thread  That stuff is mainly of interest
to technomotorcycle geeks like the readers of recmotorcycles  
but doesnt need to be taught to the average student learning csteering
Mike doesnt seem to be able to make the distinction  I know people
who can carve circles around me who couldnt tell you who Newton was
On the other hand I know very intelligent welleducated people who
think that you steer a motorcycle by either 1 leaning 2 steering
a la bicycles or 3 a combination of 1 and 2  Knowledge of physics
doesnt get you squat  knowledge of technique does
