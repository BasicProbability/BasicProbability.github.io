 No anyone who is a true rider with the real riding attitude will offer a
 wave weather they are on a Harley or on a Honda or some other bike inless
 they have a serious case of my bike is better than your and youre too low
 to be acknowleged 

I may not wave  I just wink at you with one eye  Course its hard to see
that through a shield and sunglasses but hey if youre a true rider with 
the real riding attitude youll sense it
