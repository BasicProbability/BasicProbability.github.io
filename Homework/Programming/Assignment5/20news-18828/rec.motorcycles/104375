 With a hostile dog or one which you repeatedly encounter stronger measures
 may be necessary  This is the face off  First  and there is very important
  make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory  Face him off on the
 road not on his driveway  If necessary have a large stick rolled up
 newspaper etc something the beast will understand is something that will
 hurt him  Stand your ground then slowly advance  Your mental attitude is
 that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT  The
 larger the dog the greater your anger

This tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dogs conformance to
a psychological norm that may not actually apply to a particular dog
Ive tried it with some success before but it wont work on a Charlie Manson
dog or one thats really really stupid  A large Irish Setter taught me
this in my yard apparently HIS territory one day  Im sure he was playing 
a game with me  The game was probably Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor Before 
He Can Dispense the TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT
