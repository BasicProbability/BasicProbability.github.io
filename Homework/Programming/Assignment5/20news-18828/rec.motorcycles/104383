 Im a biker and a doglover

No wonder bikers have such a horrid reputation

 The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great
 deal to them  The more effective you are at communicating body language the
 less you actually have to do 

I agree completely Unfortunately the majority
of my feelings before I can even start to think
rationally abhout the dog that is trying to kill
me are fear

When theres been a moment to set up like you
said a bit down the road or whatever Ive 
never had a problem with dogs
