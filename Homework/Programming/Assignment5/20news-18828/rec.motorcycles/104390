BZZZT If it is the other drivers fault your insurance co pays you less
deductible then recoups the total cost from the other guygals company
theres a fancy word for it which escapes me right now and pays you the
deductible Or you can go to the other guygals company right off  just
takes longer to get your cash as opposed to State Farm who cut me a check
today on the spot for the damage to my wifes cage

	The word is subrogation  Seems to me if youre willing to wait
for the money from scumbags insurance that you save having to pay the
deductible  However if scumbags insurance is Scum insurance then you may
have to pay the deductible to get your insurance cos pack of rabid large
fanged lawyers to recover the damages from Scum insurances lawyers

	Sad but true  Call it job security for lawyers

You know it sounds suspiciously like no fault doesnt even do what it
was advertised as doinggetting the lawyers out of the loop

Sigh  Another naive illusion down the toilet
