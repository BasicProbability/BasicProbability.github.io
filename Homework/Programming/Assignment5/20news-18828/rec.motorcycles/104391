Subject Re Riceburner Respect

am amazed at the number of Harley riders who ARE waving even to a lowly
baby ninja  Lets keep up the good attitudes  Brock Yates said in this
months Car and Driver he is ready for a war against those who would rather
we all rode busses  We bikers should be too

Its a freedom that we all wanna know
and its an obsession to some
to keep the world in your rearview mirror
while you try to run down the sun
