The other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
the speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
driving 12 meters behind me for 7800 meters and at the next red light I
calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
window and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why

Did I do the right thing

Yours Truly

YESSS  You make me proud to
be an Merkun  Good thing you
didnt get shot though Dont
try that with a goodole boy in Texas
I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off I was 
in my car after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
and senseless  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep he walks
back he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the
freeway has been squeezed into a single lane and says to me Stick that
finger out again and Ill rip it off your hand and shove it down your
sorryass throat  I stared straight ahead unblinking  A hundred
cars were honking  Eventually he got back into his jeep face beetred
with anger and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him 
waving honking flipping him off yelling  Im glad he decided 
not to shoot me
