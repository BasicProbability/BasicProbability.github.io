On a
waterski bike you turn the handlebars left to lean right just like on
a motorcycle so this supports the movethecontactpatchfrombeneaththe
centreofmass theory on how to lean This contradicts the need for
gyroscopic precession to have a countersteering induced lean

FOR A WATERSKI BIKE  It contradicts nothing for a motorcycle

Not only that but this morning I saw a TV ad for a waterski bike
a Sea Doo for those who care I watched the lengthy ad very
carefully and in every case and at every speed the riders turned
the handlebars left to go left and right to go right In other
words they were NOT countersteering

So perhaps it is only some waterski bikes on which one countersteers
