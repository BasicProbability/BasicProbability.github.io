Dont you just hate when the speedo and tach on your
bike start to cloud over from all that nasty sunshine
The detailing tip of the week is to use rubbing compound

Moisten a rag apply some rubbing compound and work into the
translucent previously transparent material After a few 
minutes of working on the plastic face the dial or plastic 
face will be clear once more Will not work for glass

 

BTW  I am not responsible for damages incurred when using 
      the above method  Most models can use the treatment
      safely

McGuires makes a plastic scratchremoving compound and a plastic
polishing compound which really work great as well
