 Ive got a 81 CB400T with ChenShing sp tires on it
 I got it with these tires on it  The only reason I need new tires 
 is beacuse I hate and dont feel safe on these
 
 Id appreciate any recomendations I can get about NEW tires
 
 Thanks
 Tony

Ill throw in a vote for a Metzler economy tire the ME77 Good
for midsize older bikes Rated to 130mph Wearing well and handles
my 12 mile ridetwisties to work well on the SR500 Costs a bit 
more than the ChengsIRCs etc but still less than the Sport
Metzlers for the newer bikes Cost from Chaparral is about 60 for the
front and 70 for the rear
