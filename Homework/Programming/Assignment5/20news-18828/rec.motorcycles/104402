 	For those of you with motorcycles of the liquidcooled persuasion
 what brand of coolant do you use and why  I am looking for aluminumsafe
 coolant preferably phosphatefree and preferably cheaper than 13gallon
 Can you believe it  the Kaw dealer wants 495 a QUART for the Official
 Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant  No way Im paying that usury
 

Prestone  I buy it at ShopKo for less 
than that a gallon    BMW has even more
expensive stuff than Kawasaki must be 
from grapes only grown in certain parts of
the fatherland but BMW Dave said Dont 
worry about it  just change it yearly and
keep it topped off  Its been keeping 
Gretchen happy  since 87 so I guess its OK

Kept my Rabbits aluminum radiator hoppy for
12 years and 130000 miles too so I guess
its aluminum safe
