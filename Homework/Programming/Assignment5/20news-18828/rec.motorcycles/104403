Has anyone ever heard of a rider giving a big dog such as a great dane a ride 
on the back of his bike  My dog would love it if I could ever make it work
	Thanks

 If a large Malmute counts then yes someone has heardand seen such
an irresponsible childish stunt The dog needed assistance straightening
out once on board The owner would lift the front legs of dog and throw
them over the driverpilots shoulders Said dog would get shit eating
grin on its face and away theyd go The dogs ass was firmly planted
on the seat
 
 My dog and this dog actively seek each other out at camping partys
They hate each other I think its something personal
