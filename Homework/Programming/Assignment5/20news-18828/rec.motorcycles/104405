 In states with Nofault autoinsurance this applies You basically insure your
 own vehicle and the max you can sue for is about 400 In MI anyway
 The point to be made with nofault is the fact that it removes the lawyers from the
 system and lets people get their money faster The removal of lawyers reduces the
 clogs on court system and thus reduces government burdens by not requiring so
 many judges 

 does it work I dont know ask the people of Michigan

No ask the people of New Jersey where the nofault hoax has been
going on for years  Last I heard every state that ever got nofault
insurance saw an increase in rates  I know thats what happened in
NJ because I lived there when it changed  Just one more reason I will
never go back to that state
