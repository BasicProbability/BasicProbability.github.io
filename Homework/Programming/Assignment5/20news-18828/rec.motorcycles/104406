 As a new BMW owner I was thinking about signing up for the MOA but
 right now it is beginning to look suspiciously like throwing money
 down a rathole

i concur with this

the politics and bickering going on has
ruined BMWMOA to me  because of the
politics and fighting im im going to
let my current membership lapse when its
up for renewal

ps BMWRAs On The Level is a far superiour
     publication in my opinion
