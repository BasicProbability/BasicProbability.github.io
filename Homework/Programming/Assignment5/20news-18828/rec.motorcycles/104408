hello there
ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
comment on its handling 

Youre kidding right  This is Flame bait in the extreme  Vmax handling
Har har har har

Zero to very fast very quickly lastest rumor is 115 hp at the rear wheel
handles like a dream in a straight line to 80100 and then gets a tad upset
according to a review in Cycle World cornering er well you cant have 
everything Seriously handling is probably as good as the big standards
of the early 80s but not compareable to whats state of the art these days

All this gleemed from reviews and discussions with owners I too lust after
this bike
