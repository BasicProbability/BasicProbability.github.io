Insurance companies sure seem to go for NoFault coverage  Since the
majority of accidents are the cagers fault doesnt this imply that we
would have to pay much higher rates under a NoFault system

With a carsonly system it seems to make sense on the surface take the
legal costs out of the system  But it looks like motorcyclists would
get screwed

	Yup  Unfortunately as has been pointed out the cost of insurance
does NOT go down with No Fault  The crappiest drivers make out like bandits
because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for
insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy
drivers  The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of
the crappy drivers actions and thats not fair

	Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of
shit because the rest of us end up paying more

	Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is
also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are
inherently less safe than slower drivers and the NHTSA disproved that two
years ago now
