  Grf Dropped my Shoei RF200 off the seat of my bike while trying to
 rock 
 it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it
  
  So I cheerfully spent 59 on a bottle of testors model paint and 
 repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes
  
  The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you dont know
 for 
 certain whos gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a 
 church 
 meeting yeah thats the ticket What are some guidelines Should
 I just 
 pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or
 should I 
 maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my
 likely 
 passenger 

	Do I have to be the one to say it

	DONT BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN
	FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM

	That kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against
If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed
on during the drop the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was
intended to do  Conservative recmotoers will recommend that you replace
the helmet  If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately you
should

	HELMETS GO ON THE GROUND ON A TABLE ON A CHAIR ON A SHELF OR ON
	ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY
	WILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN

	Jeezus  My new Shoei would be 340 to replace  You think Im going
to leave it to chance
