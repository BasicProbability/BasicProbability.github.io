Subject Re Riceburner Respect

In article 1993Apr917295312408cbnewsmcbattcom shzmareattcom Keeper of the Tude writes
The rider pilot of practically every riceburner Ive passed recently
has waved to me and Im wondering if it will last  Could they simply be 
overexuberant that their burners have been removed from winter mothballs 
and the novelty will soon dissipate  Perhaps the gray beard that sprouted
since the last rice season makes them think Im a friendly old fart that
deserves a wave

Maybethen again did you get rid of that HD of yorn and buy a rice rocket 
of your own  That would certainly explain the friendlinessunless you 
maybe had a piece of toilet paper stuck on the bottom of your boot8
