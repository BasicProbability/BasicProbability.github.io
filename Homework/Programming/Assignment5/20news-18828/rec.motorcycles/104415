The difference of opinion and difference in motorcycling between the sportbike
riders and the cruiserbike riders 

That difference is only in the minds of certain closedminded individuals  I
have had the very best motorcycling times with riders of cruiser 
bikes hi Don Eddie yet I ride anything but

Continuously on this forum and on the street you find quite a difference
between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals
Cruiserbike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
what they like and dislike about motorcycling This is not closedminded 
To NOT RECOGNIZE this is in effect closeminded


A lot of it reminded me of recmotorcycles and the insipid flameage thereof

If you so dislike it my occasionally leatherclad poser pal why read it

I scan it for information a lot of it is NOISE and pointless flameage
its why I used trn instead of rn

If you have a problem with that Im really sorry for you
