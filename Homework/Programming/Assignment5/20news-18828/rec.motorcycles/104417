 On a
waterski bike you turn the handlebars left to lean right just like on
a motorcycle

I dont think this is the case at least not on all jetskis  On my
friends jetski bars turn left to go left  Anyway all youre doing
there is changing the yaw of the jets so the relationship between
the handlbars and the rearmounted jets is completely arbitrary
simple linkage could make it work either way

so this supports the movethecontactpatchfrombeneaththe
centreofmass theory on how to lean This contradicts the need for
gyroscopic precession to have a countersteering induced lean

It seems to me that jetskis are even more irrelevant to this discussion
than snow skis  But it has been an amusing digression

Hey Ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horses reins
left to go left    Or am I confusing two threads here
