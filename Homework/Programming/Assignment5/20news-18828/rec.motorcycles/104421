Bzzzzt  It was me  Until I discovered my SR250 Touring Bike has a
nifty little cache on it for things like coins or lipstick  The
new Duc 750SS doesnt so Ill have to go back to carrying my lipstick
in my jacket pocket  Life is so hard  

	Am I the only denizen who thinks that the Natural Look is the best
look  The thought of kissing that waxy shit smeared all over a womans lips
is a definite turnoff
So does clear lipstickchapsticketc fit under the natural look or
the waxy shit category  I wear something on my lips to keep them from
drying out  Kissing dry cracked parched lips isnt too fun either

	Not that Ill ever be kissing Beth or Noemi 
Not if Tom has anything to say about it you wont  Noemi speaks for
herself
