My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
something Ive weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
approved method Slow down to screw up dogs triangulation of target
then take off and laugh at the dog now far behind you This time it
didnt work because I didnt have time Riding up the hill leading to my
house I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking Actually the dog encountered me with intent to
harm

  I sure hope you got the cost of a replacement panel out of the owner Here if
the owner should seem reluctant a stop by the local SPCA preferably with your
footleg all swollen up to file a viscious dog report would do the trick
