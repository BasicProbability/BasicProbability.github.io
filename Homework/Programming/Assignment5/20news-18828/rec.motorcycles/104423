 new Duc 750SS doesnt so Ill have to go back to carrying my lipstick
 in my jacket pocket  Life is so hard  

My wife is looking for a jacket and most of the mens styles shes tried
dont fit too well If they fit the shoulders and arms theyre too
tight across the chest or something like that Anyone have any 
suggestions Im assuming that the VPilot in addition to its handy
storage facilities is a pretty decent fit Is there any company that
makes a reasonable line of womens motorcycling stuff More importantly
does anyone in Boulder or Denver know of a shop that bothers carrying any

I was very lucky I found a jacket I liked that actually fits
HG makes the vpilot jackets mine is a very similar style made
by Just Leather in San Jose I bought one of the last two they
ever made

Finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy  There is a lot
of stuff out there thats fringed everywhere made of fashion leather
made to fit men etc  I dont know of a shop in your area  There
are some women rider friendly places in the San FranciscoSan Jose
area but I dont recommend buying clothing mail order  Too hard
to tell if itll fit  Bates custom makes leathers  You might want
to call them theyre in LA and get a cost estimate for the type
of jacket your wife is interested in  Large manufacturers like
BMW and HG sell womens lines of clothing of decent quality but
fit is iffy

A while ago Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting
a business doing just this sort of thing  Dont know what they
finally decided
