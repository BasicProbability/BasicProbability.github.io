The other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
the speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
driving 12 meters behind me for 7800 meters and at the next red light I
calmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
window and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why

Did I do the right thing

It works for me I avoid obscenities and try to remain calm cool and 
collected and try something like You almost just killed me and Im not 
moving until you apologize or something more or less benign like that I 
havent been shot a single time but I dont do it in Texas and I do only 
do it when there are plenty of witnesses around
