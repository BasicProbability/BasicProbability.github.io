If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size  If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws carry a real big
spare you can put a big or small head in a big helmet but not in a
small one

So what should I carry if I want to comply with intelligent helmet laws

The above comment in no way implies support for any helmet law nor should 
such support be inferred A promise is a promise
