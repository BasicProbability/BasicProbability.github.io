 The Ducati 400 model is essentially a reduced displacement 750 which
 means it weighs the same and is the same size as the 750 with far less
 power It is produced specifically to meet a vehicle tax restriction

The Ducati 750 model is essentially a reduced displacement 900 which
means it weighs the same and is the same size as the 900 with far less
power  And less brakes
Bzzzt  The 750SS is 40 pounds lighter than the 900SS  I personally
and recently witnessed my 750SS do a stoppie with a largerthan
average rider aboard  He said it took two fingers on that measely
single front disk to accomplish the task  How much more brake do
you need

As such its somewhat large and overweight for its motor It will 
still handle magnificently it just wont be very fast There are
very few other flaws to mention the limited steering lock is the 
annoyance noted by most testers And the mirrors arent perfect
I havent gone over 4000 rpm yet still in break in and havent
had a problem with the 750SS being too slow  The limited steering
lock can be a problem if you arent prepared for it  The mirrors
are very good IMHO  Someone forgot to tell their designer about
the whazza behind you she no matta philosophy
