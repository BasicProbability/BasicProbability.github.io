Subject Re Long lasting tires for small bike

 no rear tires as small as 11090 There are some fronts though

	So get a 12090 instead Is there anything that size 

 Any other recomendations
 
	Call the tire companies yourself and tell them what you have 
They can make recomendations for you Thats your best bet Check a biker
magazine Cycle World etc for phone numbers 
Its possible there are no other tires available though
