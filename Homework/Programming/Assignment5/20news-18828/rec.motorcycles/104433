The difference of opinion and difference in motorcycling between the sportbike
riders and the cruiserbike riders 

That difference is only in the minds of certain closedminded individuals  I
have had the very best motorcycling times with riders of cruiser 
bikes hi Don Eddie yet I ride anything but

Continuously on this forum and on the street you find quite a difference
between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals

Yes yes yes  Motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us  This
is the nature of people and one of the beauties of the sport  

Cruiserbike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
what they like and dislike about motorcycling This is not closedminded 

And what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds a veiw
that of course no sportbike rider could possibly hold  Please quantify your
generalization for us  Careful now youre trying to pigeonhole a WHOLE bunch
of people

That plastic bodywork is useless That torque and an upright riding position is
better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a highrpm
low torque motor

To a cruisermotorcyclist chrome has some importance To sportbike motorcyclists
chrome has very little impact on buying choice

Unless motivated solely by price these are the criteria each rider uses to select
the vehicle of choice 

To ignore these as well as other criteria would be insensitive In other words
no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sportbike rider and a cruiser
rider may havesometimes its hard for any motorcycle to fufill a persons requirements
  
Youre fishing for flames Dave

This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference
between Sportscar owners and luxurycar owners 

This is a moot conversation
