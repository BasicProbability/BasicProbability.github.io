  Grf Dropped my Shoei RF200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock 
 it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it

CONGRAULATIONS  Your helmet just passed the Snell Test
 
  So I cheerfully spent 59 on a bottle of testors model paint and 
 repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes

Oh well as least it looks ok now Still it may not save your head as well
as before you dropped it

Mike
