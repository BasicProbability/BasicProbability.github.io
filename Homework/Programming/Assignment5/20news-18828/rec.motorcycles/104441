Subject Re Shipping a bike


Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco
to Seattle  And how much might it cost

Id recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise  thats a
really nice ride if you choose your route with any care at all
Shouldnt cost more than about 30 in gas and maybe a nights motel
bill
