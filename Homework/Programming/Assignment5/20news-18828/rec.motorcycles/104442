Subject Re Vmax handling request

 Seriously handling is probably as good as the big standards
of the early 80s but not compareable to whats state of the art these days

I think you have to go a little further back
This opinion comes from riding CB750s GS1000s KZ1300s and a VMax
I find no enjoyment in riding a VMax fast on a twisty road
