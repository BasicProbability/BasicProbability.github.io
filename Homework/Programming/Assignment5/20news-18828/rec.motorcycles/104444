  No anyone who is a true rider with the real riding
  attitude will offer a wave weather they are on a Harley
  or on a Honda or some other bike inless they have a
  serious case of my bike is better than your and youre
  too low to be acknowleged This youll find is the case
  with most of the harley riders out here where I am
  however I still give them a wave and ride secure in the
  knowlege that Im a better persob than they are
                              
                        perSOB I kinda like that

Most people wave or return my wave when Im on my Harley
Other Harley riders seldom wave back to me when Im on my
duck Squids dont wave or return waves ever even to each
other from what I can tell
