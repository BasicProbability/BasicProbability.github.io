Can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from San Francisco
to Seattle  And how much might it cost

Id recommend that you hop on the back of it and cruise  thats a
really nice ride if you choose your route with any care at all
Shouldnt cost more than about 30 in gas and maybe a nights motel
bill


Yes  Up the coast over to Portland then up I5  Really nice most
of the way and Im sure theres even better ways

Watch the weather though I got about as good a drenching as
possible in the Oregon coast range once
