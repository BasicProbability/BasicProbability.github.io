Subject RE Recommendation for a front tire

In article 1qfkqhINN1s7rodanUUNET smmrodanUUNET Steve Mansfield writes
Yes my front tire is all but dead  It has minimal tread left so its
time for a new one  Any recommendations on a good tire in front  Im
riding on an almost brand new ME55A in back

 Stick an ME33 on the front  Ive got a Laser on the front of my GPz
and it has been a fantastic tire  Best front tire Ive ever had
