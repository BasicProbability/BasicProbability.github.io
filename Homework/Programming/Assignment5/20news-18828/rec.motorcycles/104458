Riding up the hill leading to my
house I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
the Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
the Spagthorpe Viking

	I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking  Was
that the one with the little illuminated Dragons Head on the front
fender a style later copied by Indian and the round side covers

accident deleted

What worries me about the accident is this I dont think I could have
prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was This is not
necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area but I was
riding around the speed limit

	You can forget this line of reasoning  When an animal
decides to take you theres nothing you can do about it  It has
something to do with their genetics  I was putting along at a
mere 20mph or so gravel road with few loose rocks on it as in
just like bad concrete and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a
fence came out of the ditch and rammed me  When I saw her jump
the fence I went for the gas since she was about 20 feet ahead
of me but a good forty to the side  Damn cow literally chased me
down and nailed me  No damage to cow a bent case guard and a
severely annoyed rider were the only casualties  If I had my
shotgun Id still be eating steak  Nope if 2200lbs of cow
can hit me when Im actively evading forget a much more
manueverable dog  Just run them over
