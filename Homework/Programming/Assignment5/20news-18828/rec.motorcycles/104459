Just before arriving at a toll booth I
switch the hazards on  I do thisto warn other motorists that I will
be taking longer than the 2 12 seconds to make the transaction
My question is this a goodbad thing to do

	This sounds like a VERY good thing to do

	Ill second that  In addition I find my hazards to be more
often used than my horn  At speeds below 40mph on the interstates
quite common in mountains with trucks some states require flashers
In rural areas flashers let the guy behind you know there is a tractor
with a rather large implement behind it in the way  Use them whenever 
you need to communicate that things will deviate from the norm

	Is that ZX11 painted green  Since the green Triumph 650 that
a friend owned was sold off her name is now free for adoption  How
does the name Thunderpickle grab you
