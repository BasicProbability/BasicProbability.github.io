Subject Battery storage  why not charge and store dry

So it looks like Im going to have to put a couple of bikes in storage
for a few months starting several months from now and Im already
contemplating how to do it so theyre as easy to get going again as
possible I have everything under control I think besides the
batteries I know that if I buy a 5000 Battery Tender for each one
and leave them plugged in the whole time the bikes are in storage
theyll be fine But Im not sure thats necessary Ive never heard
anyone discussing this idea so maybe theres some reason why it isnt
so great But maybe someone can tell me

Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries drain the
electrolyte into separate containers one for each battery seal the
container close up the batteries and leave them that way Then it
would seem that when the bikes come out of storage I could put the
electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully
charged Whats wrong with this

On a related but different note for you Bay Area Denizens wasnt
there someone who had a bunch of spare EDTA a few months back Who was
it Is there still any of it left

Thanks for any and all help
