Sorry I lost the attributions
In most areas drivers are required to show proof of financial 
responsibility which usually means insurance 

Required how  When they get pulled over  Most drivers bellyaching on the
net aside dont get pulled over and checked  The laws are enforceable
only after the fact in which case often somebody is out a lot of money

Dont you have any requirement for yearly plate stickers in the US In
Ontario and Manitoba for sure and the other provinces i think you have
to show proof of insurnace when you renew your plate ie get a new sticker

Yes  Unfortunately there is also the concept that the owner of a car
is not responsible for the actions of any authorized user of the car
Thats one of the biggest arguments against photoradar ticketing
systems

You also get to pay all outstanding tickets They even have cross province
agreements at least between Ontario and Quebec so that unpaid tickets in
the other province are on record No having an up to date sticker is a bad

Trouble with that is you then have no recourse if a misissued ticket
or a clerical error on a computer follow you around  The City of Chicago
the informal motto of which being The City the Works issues dozens
of parking tickets each year to people who have never set foot or tire
in the city
