Lets get this No Fault stuff straight I lived in NJ
when NF started my rates went up ALOT Moved to PA
and my rates went down ALOT the NF came to PA and it
was a different story If you are sitting in a parking
lot having lunch or whatever and someone wacks you guess
whose insurance pays for it  give up   YOURS

Only if you have a weeny insurance company Unless its
some stupid PA law  I know that if some jerk hits me while 
Im in a parking lot if my insruance company doesnt sue
his or his doesnt immediately say Yes its his fault
Ill sure him myself and tell my insurance company to go to
hell if they raise my rates
