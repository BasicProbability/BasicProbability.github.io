Ultra sticky labels printed with your
favourite curse are good  even our local hospitals use them instead of
wheel clamps putting one about A5 size on each window of the cage

An apartment complex where I used to live tried this only they put the
thing over the drivers window so they couldnt miss it  A friend
damned near wrecked on the way home one night her vision blocked by
the sticker  I suggested to the manager the ENORMOUS liability they
were assuming by pulling that stunt  She claimed it was the driver who
was at fault for illegally parking in the first place  That would
probably be good for a laugh or two in court before they found her
liable for Serious

Be careful about putting stickers on cages windows

Yeah make darn sure you cover all the glass so the driver cant
reasonably expect to be able to drive with the things on the car
