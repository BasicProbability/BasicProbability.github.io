Back in my youth ahem the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
water from a 12V source  It was for car use but we thought wed try it on my
RD350B  It worked OK apart from one slight problem we had to keep the revs 
above 7000  Any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement

On my LC RZ to any excolonists I replaced the bolt at the bottom of the barrel
with a tap When I wanted a coffee I could just rev the engine until boiling
and pour out a cup of hot water
I used ethylene glycol as antifreeze rather than methanol as it tastes sweeter
