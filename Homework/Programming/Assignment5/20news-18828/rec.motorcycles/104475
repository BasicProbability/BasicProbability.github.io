Which is better  a onepiece Aerostitch or a twopiece Aerostitch


Were looking for more than Well the 2pc is more versatile but the 
1pc is better protection	

Thanks in advance
Nadine

I would be scared of trying to fit the one piece  When I got my
two piece I got the jacket in 42 and the pants in 40 just due
to my manlyman of an athletic build kind of thing  No laughing
please  Seriously Im not trim and the 42 pants would have
been way too big  Also I dont think the 1 piece does provide
better protection  If Im wrong Ill be swiftly if ever so gently
correct by the netpansiesofknowledge as they like to call themselves
