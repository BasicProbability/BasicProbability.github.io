mjsAlso IMHO telling newbies about countersteering is er counterproductive
mjscos it just confuses them I rode around quite happily for 10 years 
mjsknowing nothing about countersteering I cannot say I ride any differently
mjsnow that I know about it

I interpret this to mean that youre representative of every other
motorcyclist in the world eh Mike  Rather presumptive of you

IMHO  in my humble opinion

leavittThe time to learn countersteering techniques is when you are first
leavittstarting to learn before you develop any bad habits  I rode for
leavittfive years before taking my first course MSF ERC and learning
leavittabout how to countersteer  Its now eight years later and I still
leavitthave to consciously tell myself Dont steer COUNTERsteer  Old
leavitthabits die hard and bad habits even harder

mjsSorry Bill but this is complete bollocks You learned how to countersteer 
mjsthe first time you rode the bike its natural and intuitive 

Sorry Mike Im not going to kick over the can you not countersteer
over 5mph stone  That ones been kicked around enough  For the sake of
argument Ill concede that its countersteering sake of argument only

mjsMSF did not teach you how to countersteer it only told you what
mjsyou were already doing

And theres no value in that 


I didnt say there was no value  all I said was that it is very confusing
to newbies 

 Theres a BIG difference in 1 knowing
whats happening and how to make it do it especially in the extreme
case of an emergency swerve and 2 just letting the bike do whatever
it does to make itself turn  Once I knew precisely what was happening
and how to make it do it abruptly and on command my emergency avoidance
abilities improved tenfold not to mention a big improvement in my normal
cornering ability  I am much more proficient knowing how to countersteer
the motorcycle rather than letting the motorcycle steer itself  That is
when I remember to take cognitive command of the bike rather than letting
it run itself through the corners  Whereupon I return to my original
comment  better to learn whats happening right from the start and how
to take charge of it rather than developing the bad habit of merely going
along for the ride

Bill you are kidding yourself here Firstly motorcycles do not steer
themselves  only the rider can do that Secondly it is the adhesion of the
tyre on the road the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
 motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles and
not the knowledge of physics between the riders ears Are you seriously
suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise


Mike Im extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural
affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total
waste of time for you assuming your total training hasnt come from
simply from reading recmotorcycles  However 90 of the motorcyclists
Ive discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience
as overwhelmingly positive  This regardless of the amount of experience
they brought into the course ranging from 10 minutes to 10 years

Formal training in this country as far as I am aware does not include
countersteering theory  I found out about countersteering about six years ago
from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist I didnt believe him
at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left
but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing and realized he was 
right Its an interesting bit of knowledge and Ive had a lot of fun since
then telling others about it who were at first as sceptical as I was But
thats all it is  an interesting bit of knowledge and to claim that
it is essential for all bikers to know it or that you can corner faster
or better as a result is absurd

Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if youre going to
be able to ride a bike properly and safely But by including countersteering
theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn
And that was my original point

Mike
