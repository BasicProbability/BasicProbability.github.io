Subject Re Wheres The Oil on my K75 Going

In article C5DLvo6Jskatesgsfcnasagov timintrepidgsfcnasagov Tim Seiss writes

  After both oil changes the oil level was at the top mark in the
window on the lower right side of the motor but Ive been noticing
that the oil level seen in the window gradually decreases over the
miles  Im always checking the window with the bike on level ground
and after it has sat idle for awhile so the oil has a chance to drain
back into the pan  The bike isnt leaking oil any place and I dont
see any smoke coming out of the exhaust

  My owners manual says the amount of oil corresponding to the
high and low marks in the oil level window is approx 5 quart  It
looks like my bike has been using about 25 quarts1000 miles  The
owners manual also gives a figure for max oil consumption of about
08ozmile or 15L100km

  My question is whether the degree of oil consumption Im seeing on
my bike is normal  Have any other K75 owners seen their oil level
gradually and consistently go down  Should I take the bike in for
work  Im asking local guys also to get as many data points as I
can  


Its normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
miles  I dont know why  Ive had three new K bikes and all three used a
bit of oil when new  max maybe 4 quart in first 1000 miles this soon quits
and by the time I had 10000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero
Ive been told that the harder you run the bike within reason the sooner
it stops using any oil
