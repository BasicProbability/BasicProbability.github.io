I have a quick question  I recently got a bike and drive it often but my  
one problem is the wind messing with my contacts  I have gas permeable  

How about a full face helmet with the face sheild down  Works for me

	Actually this doesnt always work for me either I have wind that
	blows around inside my RF200 some and itll dry my eyes out  get dust
	in them eventually unless Im also wearing sunglasses inside my
	helmet

I too usually wear sunglasses inside my full face helmet to keep dirt  wind
out of my contacts  Mumble mumble mumble
