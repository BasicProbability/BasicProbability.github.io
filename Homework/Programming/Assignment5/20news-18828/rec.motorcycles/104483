Subject Re GGRRRrrr  Cages doubleparking motorcycles pisses me off

Evelyn Wells on the 12 Apr 1993 1143 CST wibbled
 Once again this morning I pulled up to the designated motorcycle
 parking area only to find a cage pulled up behind the bikes 
 If people dont doublepark cars why do they do it to motorcycles
 Never mind that rhetorical question I know why they do it

 What I want to know is what can I do about it  Carry pieces of
 paper that say Dont park your car in the motorcycle area 
 Call the cops  Wait until they emerge from the building and berate
 them until they beg forgiveness  

 Does anyone else have this problem and what do you do about it

 Evie

I dont know if you have a local branch where you are but the preferred method
over here is to phone the IRA and tell them about the car and that it 
belongs to an MP who is on a Northern Ireland Government Committee  An hour
or so later and the car is no longer a problem  Its best not to park too 
close to it though
