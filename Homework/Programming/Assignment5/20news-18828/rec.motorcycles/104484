   You think your average dirt biker can jump
 a 3 foot log 
 
 How about an 18 log that is suspended about 18 off of the ground
 For that matter how about a 4 log that is suspended 25 off of the
 ground

 Oh ye of little imagination

You dont jump over those thats where you lay the bike down and slide under

The nice thing about horses though is that if they break down in the middle of
nowhere you can eat them  Fuels a bit cheaper too
