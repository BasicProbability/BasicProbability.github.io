 Okay DoDers heres a goddamn mystery for ya 
 
 
 The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent  Im
 fairly sure it was there before the event  In fact the thread in
 the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact with no evidence of something
 having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously  
 
 Okay all you engineering types how the fk do you explain this   How can you
 rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole in alloy without
 damaging the thread in the hole   

You cant knock a threaded stud out from its hole without destroying 
the threads  Also part of the stud would still be in the hole 
Therefore the stud was not in the hole before you touched something 
down on that side of the bike
