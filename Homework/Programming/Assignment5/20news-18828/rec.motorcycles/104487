2  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  I turn 18 in 
about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference

It depends on the bike Once youve found a bike youre interested in call
some insurance companies for rates Some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
you might think my EX500 only costs me 127year in St Louis Im 27

3  Any recommendations on what I should buywhere I should look for it

For a first bike I recommend 500ccs or less And a bike short enough to get
both feet on the ground when you stop
 
The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle Safety
Foundation Riders Course See a dealer for details In some states completion
of such a course can give you a break on insurance It will also teach you
to ride properly from the beginning so you wont learn any bad habits

Good luck Riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have naked or otherwise
