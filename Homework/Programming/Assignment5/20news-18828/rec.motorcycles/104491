Im very new to motorcycles Havent even bought one yet I was in the same
position about you How do you learn if youve never ridden

I took a class put on by a group called the Motorcycle Safety Foundation
in California They might have something similar in Washington

Try calling a motorcycle dealer in your area and asking Its a good first 
start on how to ride a motorcycle correctly
