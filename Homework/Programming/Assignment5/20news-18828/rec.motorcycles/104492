 NMMSubject How to act in front of traffic jerks
 
 NMMThe other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
 NMMthe speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
 NMMdriving 12 meters behind me for 7800 meters and at the next red light I
 NMMcalmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
 NMMwindow and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why
 
 NMMDid I do the right thing

	imho you did the wrong thing  You could have been shot
 or he could have run over your bike or just beat the shit
 out of you  Consider that the person is foolish enough
 to drive like a fool and may very well act like one too

 Just get the heck away from the idiot

 IF the driver does something clearly illegal you can
 file a citizens arrest and drag that person into court
 Its a hassle for you but a major hassle for the perp
