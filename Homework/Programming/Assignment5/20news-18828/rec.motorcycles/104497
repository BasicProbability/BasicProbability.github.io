Subject Re Shaftdrives and Wheelies


In a previous article xlyxvax5citcornelledu  says

Mike Terry asks

Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
off the ground
