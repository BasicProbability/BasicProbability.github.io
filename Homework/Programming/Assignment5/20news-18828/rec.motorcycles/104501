NMMSubject How to act in front of traffic jerks

Ive found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal You will obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
himherit may mean that something is wrong


  I see one thing wrong with your strategy
The boy who cried wolf
