1  I only have about 12001300 to work with so that would have 
to cover everything bike helmet anything else that Im too 
ignorant to know I need to buy

The following numbers are approximate and will no doubt get me flamed

Helmet new but cheap					100
Jacket used or very cheap				100
Gloves nothing special				 20
Motorcycle Safety Foundation riding course a must	140

That leaves you between 900 and 1000 depending on the accuracy
of my numbers to buy a used bike get it registered get it
insured and get it running properly Id say youre cutting
it close Perhaps if your parents are reasonable and you indicated
your wish to learn to ride safely you could get them to pick up
the cost of the MSF course and some of the safety gear Early
holiday presents or whatever Those are onetime well longterm
anyway investments and you could spend your money on the actual
bike insurance registration and maintenance
