 With regards to the pub brawl he might have a history of such things
 Just because he was a biker doesnt make him out to be a reasonable
 person  Even the DoD might object to him joining who knows

If he had a history of such things why was it not mentioned in the
article and why did they present the irrelevant detail of where he
got his drinking money from

I cant say exactly who is at fault here but from where I sit is
looks like were seeing the results either of the law going way out
of hand or of shoddy journalism

If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement they
should put the money in trust  They dont so I would assume its
perfectly legitimate to drink it away though I wouldnt spend it that
way myself
