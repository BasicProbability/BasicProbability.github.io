  With regards to the pub brawl he might have a history of such things
  Just because he was a biker doesnt make him out to be a reasonable
  person  Even the DoD might object to him joining who knows

 If he had a history of such things why was it not mentioned in the
 article and why did they present the irrelevant detail of where he
 got his drinking money from

 I cant say exactly who is at fault here but from where I sit is
 looks like were seeing the results either of the law going way out
 of hand or of shoddy journalism

 If the law wants to attach strings to how you spend a settlement they
 should put the money in trust  They dont so I would assume its
 perfectly legitimate to drink it away though I wouldnt spend it that
 way myself

We heard about this from a newspaper article  Journalists and editors
always pick out the most interesting and sensational facts for our
delectation  As the editor of the Sun once said We never let the
facts get in the way of a good story  You must have noticed how
motorcyclists get treated by the press  They thrive on hysteria
ignorance sensationalism and oneupmanship  Unfortunately theres
not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of
