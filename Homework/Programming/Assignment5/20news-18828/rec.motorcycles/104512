 Can somebody tell me what all the letter spesifications on motorcycle models 
 really mean 
 Example What means the C the B and the R in Honda CBR  Or the V S G L 
 and P in Suzuki VS750GLP

Honda  a V designates a V engine street bike VF for V4 VT for Vtwin
CB is a street bike with an parallel twin or inline 4cylinder engine
R used to mean race bike but is now also used to mean sport bike
CL was for the old steet scramblersstreet bikes with high pipes
CM was a custom street bike
CR is dirt only two strokes
XL is dual purpose bike
XR was dirt only four stroke but now can be a dual purpose bike if it has
an L as a suffix
GL is a touring bike
