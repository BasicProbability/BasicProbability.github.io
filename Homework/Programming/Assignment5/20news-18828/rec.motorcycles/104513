  If I dont end up replacing it in the real near future would I do better 
 to wear my totally nondamaged 34 face DOTRATED cheapie which doesnt fit 
 as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the Shoei RF200 which is a 
 LOT more comfortable keeps the wind out better is quieter but might 
 have some minor damage
 
  Wear the RF200  Even after a few drops  paint chips it is FAR better
 than no helmet or a poorly fitting one  Ive had many scratches  bangs
 which have been repaired plus Im still confident of the protection the
 helmet will continue to give me  Only when you actually see depressions
                                    
 or actual cracks using a magnifying glass should you consider replacement

  

This is not good advice  A couple of years I was involved in a lowspeed
getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement  My head helmeted
hit the pavement with a clunk leaving a couple of dings and chips in the
paint at the point of impact but no other visible damage  I called the
helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage  They said that the way a
fiberglass shell works is to first give then delaminate then crack
This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a
wider area  After the fiberglass has done its thing the crushable foam
liner takes care of absorbing hopefully the remaining impact force
They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality delamination
of the glassresin layers can occur with NO visible signs either inside or
outside of the helmet  They suggested that I send them the helmet and they
would inspect it including Xraying  I did so  They sent back the helmet
with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would
compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection
I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim
prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them

The bottom line though is that it appears that a helmets integrity
can be compromised with no visible signs  The only way to know for sure
is to send it back and have it inspected  Note that some helmet
manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not  Another point
to consider when purchasing a lid
