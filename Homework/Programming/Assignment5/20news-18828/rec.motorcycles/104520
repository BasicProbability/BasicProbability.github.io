Subject Help  Which bikes are short

Help  Ive got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle  This is great
Unfortunately she needs at most a 28 seat  This is not great  So far
the only thing weve found was an old and unhappylooking KZ440

So its time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there
Anybody know of models old models and used bikes are not a problem
with a 28 or lower seat  And since she has to make this difficult  8 
she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser  So theres bonus points
for listing tiny standards

I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through
several months ago  Did anybody keep that list

Thanks
