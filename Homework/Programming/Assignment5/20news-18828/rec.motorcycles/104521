Subject Re CB750 C with flames out the exhaust

From article C5quw0Btqux1csouiucedu by mikehux1csouiucedu Mike Hollyman
 Hi I have an 82 CB750 Custom that I just replaced the cylinder head gasket
 on  Now when I put it back together again it wouldnt idle at all  It was
 only running on 23 cylinders and it would backfire and spit flames out the
 exhaust on the right side  The exhaust is 42 MAC  I bought new plugs
 today and it runs very rough and still wont idle  I am quite sure the fine
 tune knobs on the carbs are messed up  I checked the timing it was fine so
 I advanced it a little and that didnt help  
 
 I assume the carbs need to be synched  Can I buy a kit and do this myself
 If so what kit is the best for the price
 
 Any other suggestions
 
	I dont think its the carbs that are out I would suspect that
the cam timing is out  as you say that you had the head off that
would make sense to me
