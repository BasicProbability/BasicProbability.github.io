       What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under
Influence so here what does W stand for 

Driving While Intoxicated

  Actually I beleive DWI normally means Driving While Impaired rather
than Intoxicated at least it does in the states Ive lived in

This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her 
case by claiming to be stoned on pot NOT intoxicated on liquor

  One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor  drugs
not enough sleep being a total moron  all can impair someone etc  Im
surprised this got her off the hook  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana is confined
to liquor
