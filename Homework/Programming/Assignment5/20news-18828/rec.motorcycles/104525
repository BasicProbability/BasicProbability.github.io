NMMSubject How to act in front of traffic jerks

NMMThe other day it was raining cats and dogs therefor I was going only to
NMMthe speed limit on nothing more on my bike This guy in his BMW was
NMMdriving 12 meters behind me for 7800 meters and at the next red light I
NMMcalmly put the bike on its leg walked back to this car he rolled down the
NMMwindow and I told him he was a total idiot and the reason why

NMMDid I do the right thing

Well sounds great to me When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me
Ive found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
pumping the pedal You will obviously need a bit of free play in your
brake pedal to do this It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
himherit may mean that something is wrong

The two problems Id see with your strategy is that the red light may
change before you can get anything meaningful out of your mouth or the
occupants may take exception to your opinions and demonstrate such
physically on you or your nowparked bike Admittedly the latter is a
slim chance but it would be enough to give me pause
