Subject New to Motorcycles

Hello everyone  Im new to motorcycles so no flames please  I dont
have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information

1  I only have about 12001300 to work with so that would have 
to cover everything bike helmet anything else that Im too 
ignorant to know I need to buy

2  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance  I turn 18 in 
about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
till now and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
motorcycle is going to insure I live in Washington DC if that makes
a difference

3  Any recommendations on what I should buywhere I should look for it

4  In DC as I imagine it is in every other state OK OK were not a 
state  were not bitter  you take the written test first and then
get a learners permit  However Im wondering how one goes about 
learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a get a liscence
and b not kill oneself  I dont know anyone with a bike who could 
teach me and the most advice Ive heard is either do you live near a
field or do you have a friend with a pickup truck the answers to both
of which are NO  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for 
the best  I kind of live in a residential area but its not suburbs
Its still the big city and Im about a mile from downtown so that 
doesnt seem too viable  Any stories on how you all learned

Thanks for any replies in advance
