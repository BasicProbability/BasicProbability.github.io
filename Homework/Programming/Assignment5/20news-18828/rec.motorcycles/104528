 RollsRoyce owned by a nonBritish firm
 
 Ye Gods that would be the end of civilization as we know it
 
   Why not  Ford owns AstonMartin and Jaguar General Motors owns Lotus
 and Vauxhall  Rover is only owned 20 by Honda
 
 Yes its a minor blasphemy that US companies would on the likes of AM
 Jaguar or sob Lotus  Its outright sacrilege for RR to have nonBritish
 ownership  Its a fundamental thing


I think there is a legal clause in the RR name regardless of who owns it
it must be a British companyowner  ie BA can sell the company but not
the name
