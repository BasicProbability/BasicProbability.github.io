Subject      Re GGRRRrrr Cages doubleparking motorc

An apartment complex where I used to live tried this only they put the
thing over the drivers window so they couldnt miss it  A friend
damned near wrecked on the way home one night her vision blocked by
the sticker  I suggested to the manager the ENORMOUS liability they
were assuming by pulling that stunt  She claimed it was the driver who
was at fault for illegally parking in the first place  That would
probably be good for a laugh or two in court before they found her
liable for Serious

Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired
Isnt that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such

Say thats another thing that bugs me  Why dont people scrape their
damn windows  Ive seen people driving cars with barely the drivers
half of the windshield cleared  Nothing else cleared  This seems
pretty stupid and isnt there something probably varies state to state
that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear  Oh well
