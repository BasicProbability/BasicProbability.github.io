Help  Ive got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle  This is great
Unfortunately she needs at most a 28 seat  This is not great  So far
the only thing weve found was an old and unhappylooking KZ440

    I had a kz440 and thought it was the best 100 bike Ive ever
    ridden  And mind you Ive ridden many bikes

I seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through
several months ago  Did anybody keep that list

    You must be mistaken No thread in this group has ever had a point


Seriously there are many short bikes out there  What style bike
and how much money does she have  My SO is 53 and rides her CB1
or my hawk GT with ease  Most cruisers are low slung  YSR50s are
real short too
