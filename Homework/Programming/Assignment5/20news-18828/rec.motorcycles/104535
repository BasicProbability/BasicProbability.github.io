cjackson I am very glad to know that none of you judgemental little shits has
cjackson riddendriven when too tired sleepy hungover angry or distracted
cjackson in the last 3 years Why if you had then you might be just as guilty

Some of us notso judgmental little shits dont driveride when were
impaired  I stopped doing that sort of thing when a good friend of
mine got killed by a drunk driver who failed to stop for a red and
drove through the side of her volvo in his 72 caddy

Then again I suspect most of the responsible adults on the net dont
bother posting in flame wars on recmoto

cjackson There is no justification for taking away individuals freedom
cjackson  in the guise of public safety  Thomas Jefferson

He also owned slaves kept some as forced concubines and had enough
resources to do what he wanted without fear of reprisal  Then again
he also smoked dope
