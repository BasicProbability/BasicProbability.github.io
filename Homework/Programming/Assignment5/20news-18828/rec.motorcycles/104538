Subject Re More MOA stuff  like the RA

From what Ive seen in my 17 years as an MOA member most of the folks
in the RA are also in the MOA I guess its called covering all the
bases to get some idea of what is really happening How else does one
think the RA gets all the juicey news about whats happen inside the 
MOA

Nihilism isnt for everyone not that it really matters
