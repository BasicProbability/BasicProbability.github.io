  RollsRoyce owned by a nonBritish firm
  
  Ye Gods that would be the end of civilization as we know it
  
    Why not  Ford owns AstonMartin and Jaguar General Motors owns Lotus
  and Vauxhall  Rover is only owned 20 by Honda
  
  Yes its a minor blasphemy that US companies would  on the likes of AM
  Jaguar or sob Lotus  Its outright sacrilege for RR to have nonBritish
  ownership  Its a fundamental thing


 I think there is a legal clause in the RR name regardless of who owns it
 it must be a British companyowner  ie BA can sell the company but not
 the name

I dont believe that BA have anything to do with RR  Its a seperate
company from the RR AeroEngine company  I think that the government
own a stake  Unfortunately they owned a stake of Jaguar too until
they decided to make a quick buck and sold it to Ford  Bastards
This is definitely the ultimate ArthurDaley government
