Subject Cobra Locks

I was posting to Altlocksmithing about the best methods for securing 
a motorcycle  I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock
described below  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock
in the Chicago area

Any other feedback from someone who has used this

Thanks for any info

Steve

 Incidentally the best lock Ive found for bikes is the Cobra Lock
 Its a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel sleeve
 The lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints
 at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs
 You cant get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder
 is wellprotected  I wouldnt want to cut one of these without a torch
 andor a vice and heavy duty cutting wheel
