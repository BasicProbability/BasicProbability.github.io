 55E  I81I66E  After this point the route is presently undetermined
 into Pennsylvania New York and back to Chicago by 66  Suggestions 

If you do make it into New York state the Palisades Interstate Parkway is a
pleasant ride beautiful scenery good road surface minimal traffic  You
may also want to take a sidetrip along Seven Lakes Drive just off the parkway
for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with
sweeping turns under old forest canopy
