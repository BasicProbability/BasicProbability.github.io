Help  Ive got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle  This is great
Unfortunately she needs at most a 28 seat  This is not great  So far
the only thing weve found was an old and unhappylooking KZ440

Look for a happierlooking KZ440

Suzuki used to have an L designation for example my former boss had a
GS850L which had a seat a couple inches lower than the regular
GS850 but it was certainly no cruiser
