 Mike Terry asks
 
 Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive
 
 No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
 of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
 off the ground

	This is true as evinced by the popularity of shaftdrive drag bikes
