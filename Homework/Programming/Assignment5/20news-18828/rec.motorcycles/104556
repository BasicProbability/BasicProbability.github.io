I was posting to Altlocksmithing about the best methods for securing 
a motorcycle  I got several responses referring to the Cobra Lock
described below  Has anyone come across a store carrying this lock
in the Chicago area

	It is available through some dealerships who in turn have to back
order it from the manufacturer directly  Each one is made to order at least
if you get a nonstandard length standard is 5 I believe

Any other feedback from someone who has used this

	See below

 Incidentally the best lock Ive found for bikes is the Cobra Lock
 Its a cable which is shrouded by an articulated hardened steel sleeve
 The lock itself is cylindrical and the locking pawl engages the joints
 at the articulation points so the chain can be adjusted like handcuffs
 You cant get any leverage on the lock to break it open and the cylinder
 is wellprotected  I wouldnt want to cut one of these without a torch
 andor a vice and heavy duty cutting wheel

	I have a 6 long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley she
doesnt get out much anymore so I dont use the lock that often anymore  It
is made of 34 articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable
It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders but unfortunately
professionals can open it rather easily

	1 Freeze a link

	2 Break frozen link with your favorite method hammers work well

	3 Snip through the steel cables which I have on authority are
		frightfully thin with a set of boltcutters

	For the same money you can get a Kryptonite cable lock which is
anywhere from 12 to 78 thick steel cable looks like steel rope shielded
in a flexible covering to protect your bikes finish and has a barreltype
locking mechanism  I dont know if its adjustable but my source says its
more difficult to pick than most locks and the cable tends to squish flat
in boltcutter jaws rather than shear 58 model

	All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel
Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute

	FYI Ill be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck

Later
