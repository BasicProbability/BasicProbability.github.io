These are the figures from the Performance Bikes lock test taken without
permission of course The price is for comparison All the cable locks
have some sort of armour the chain locks are padlock and chain Each
lock was tested for a maximum of ten minutes 600 secs for each test

	BJ	Bottle jack
	CD	Cutting disc
	BC	Bolt croppers

The table should really be split into immoblisers forawhile and
locktosomethings forashortwhile to make comparisons

Pretty depressing reading I think a good lock and some common sense about
where and when you park your bike is the only answer Ive spent all my
spare time over the last two weeks landscaping trashing the garden of
my and two friends with bikes new house to accommodate our three bikes in
relative security never underestimate how much room a bike requires to
manouver in a walled area   Anyway since the weekend there are only two
bikes  and no he didnt use his Abus closed shackle lock it was too much
hassle to take with him when visiting his parents A minimum wait of 8
weeks if they dont decide to investigate for the insurance company
to make an offer and for the real haggling to begin

Abus are a German company and it would seem not well represented in the US
but very common in the UK The UK distributor given in the above article
is
	Michael Brandon Ltd
	1517 Oliver Crescent
	Hawick
	Roxburgh TD9 9BJ
	Tel 0450 73333

The UK distributors for the other locks can also given if required

Dont lose it
