 55E  I81I66E  After this point the route is presently undetermined
 into Pennsylvania New York and back to Chicago by 66  Suggestions 

If you do make it into New York state the Palisades Interstate Parkway is a
pleasant ride beautiful scenery good road surface minimal traffic  You
				   

	Been a while since you hit the PIP The pavement at least until around
	exit 9 is for sht these days I think it must have taken a beating
	this winter because I dont remember it being this bad Its all
	breaking apart and there are some serious potholes now Of course
	there are also the storm drains that are in your lane as opposed
	to on the side of the road talk about annoying cost saving measures
		
	As for traffic dont try it around 515  630 on weekdays outbound
	rush hour happens inbound too as there are many BDCs
