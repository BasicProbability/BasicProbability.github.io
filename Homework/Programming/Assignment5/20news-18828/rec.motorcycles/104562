 Having talked to a couple people about helmets  dropping Im getting 
about 20 Dont sweat it 78 You might think about replacing it and the 
other 2 DONT RIDE WITH IT GO WITHOUT A HELMET FIRST
 
 Is there any way to tell if a helmet is damaged structurally I dropped it 
about 2 12 feet to cement off my seat chipped the paint Didnt seem to 
screw up the actual shell 

Id bet the price of the helmet that its okayFrom 6 feet
or higher maybe not

 If I dont end up replacing it in the real near future would I do better 
to wear my totally nondamaged 34 face DOTRATED cheapie which doesnt fit 
as well or keep out the wind as well or wearing the Shoei RF200 which is a 
LOT more comfortable keeps the wind out better is quieter but might 
have some minor damage

Id wear the full facer but then Id be way more worried
about wind blast in the face and inability to hear police
sirens than the helmet being a little damaged


 Also what would you all reccomend as far as good helmets Im slightly 
disappointed by how badly the shoei has scratched  etc from not being 
bloody careful about it and how little impact it took to chip the paint 
and arguably mess it up period Looking at a really good fullface with 
good venting  wind protection I like the Shoei style kinda like the 
Norton one I saw awhile back too But suspect Im going to have to get a 
much more expensive helmet if I want to not replace it every time Im not 
being careful where I set it down

Well my next helmet will be subject to it fitting well an AGV
sukhoi Thats just because I like the looks My current one is
a Shoei task5 and its getting a little old and I crashed in
it once a couple of years ago no hard impact to headMy hip
took care of that If price was a consideration Id get
a Kiwi k21 I hear they are both good and cheap

 Christ I dont treat my HEAD as carefully as I treated the shoei as far as 
tossing it down and I dont have any bruises on it 

Be mildly mildly paranoid about the helmet but dont get
carried away There are people on the net like those 2 you
mentioned that do not consistently live on our planet
