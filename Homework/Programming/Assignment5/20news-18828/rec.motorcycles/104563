No No No No All I am saying is that you dont even need to tell people the 
technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first
time they try to go round a corner

Some will and others will steer with their tuchuses I dont know how much
the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
tuchus steerers I was one I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way
and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding after the course
I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem but I only
started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed
offramps and the like was a lot more difficult that it should have been
I knew how it works although thats currently up for debate definitely knew
that it works as I could do it in swerves but only figured it out later
in my normal riding Just a data point I think that its not a bad idea to
bring the idea up but its best to let everyone tuchussteer for the first
lesson or two so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry
about proper handlebar technique

countersteering  In fact my Experienced Rider Course instructors
claimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike
turn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight
around even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite
direction  I admit Ive never actually seen this

I have In our beginner course we had passenger training Sometime during
the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike and the student
would take him for a ride If the student did not give the instructor the
you are a sack of potatoes passenger speech the instructor would steer
the bike and make a general nuisance of himself It was amusing to watch
Im just happy that it didnt happen to me
