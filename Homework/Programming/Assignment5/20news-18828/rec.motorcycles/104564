On the other side of the fence I owned a Bieffe offroad helmet
Took what I would consider a minor fall and had visible damage
to the shell  Yes the helmet did its job  But the damageimpact
ratio was scary  I own Bell Moto5 now have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact we do this frequently in MX
and dont even have a scratch on it after two seasons  My
recommendation is to buy high quality gear  YMMV

When your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object there are only four things
to dissipate the energy the immoveable object the helmet shell the helmet
liner the riders head the riders ego ok five Assuming that the helmet
head assembly takes the same impact if the shell cracks in one case then in
the other the liner must be dented or the head gets jiggled If its the
the liner thats dented the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were
cracked it wont absorb energy form an impact in that area If its the head
thats getting jiggled maybe the new gear isnt of as high quality after all
