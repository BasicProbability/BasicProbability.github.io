       Ok hold on a second and clarify something for me

       What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under
Influence so here what does W stand for 

Driving While Intoxicated

This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her 
case by claiming to be stoned on pot NOT intoxicated on liquor

Here its driving while impaired That about covers everything

Ive        bike                      like        Jody Levine  DoD 275 kV
