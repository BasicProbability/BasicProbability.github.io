Im thinking of buying a motorcycle Whenever I tell people
this I usually get an answer like Why do you want to do that
My brother sister cousin knows somebody who had a motorcycle
and now they are brain dead as a result of an accident

So the question I have is HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING            

Its exactly as dangerous as it looks Youre hard to see and have little
protection Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits keeping your
machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid
move that drivers make out there We deal with it because its fun but
staying alive takes a conscious effort

Ive        bike                      like        Jody Levine  DoD 275 kV
