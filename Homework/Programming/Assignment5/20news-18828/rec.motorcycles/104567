Well it looks like Im Fcked for insurance

I had a DWI in 91 and for the beemer as a rec
vehicle itll cost me almost 1200 bucks to insureyear

Now what do I do

Sell the bike and the car and start taking the bus That way you can
keep drinking which seems to be where your priorities lay

I expect that enough of us on this list have lost friends because of
driving drunks that our collective sympathy will be somewhat muted

Look guy I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving but if
hes been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
lighten up I mean it isnt like most of us havent had a few
and then ridden or driven home We just didnt get caught
And I can speak for myself and say it will never happen again
but that is beside the point

In answer to the original poster Id insure whatever vehicle
is cheapest and can get you to and from work and suffer
through it for a few years til your rates drop

And dont drink and drive I had one friend killed by a 
drunk and I was rear ended by one totaling my bike bent
frame and only failing to kill me because I had an eye
on my mirror while I waited at the stoplight
