  Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive
 
	Yes but the rear wheel comes off the ground not the front
 See it just HOPS into the air  Figure

  Sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike I had a BMW R100RS
that was a wheelie monster Of course it didnt have the initial power
burst to just twist it into the air  I had to pop the clutch I also
had to replace front fork seals a few times as well The fairing is a 
bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
time But let me give you fair warning I trashed the ringpinion gear
in the final drive of my K75 I assume doing wheelies And this was 
NO cheap fix either There is some kind of slip device in the shaft
to prevent IT from breaking Unfortunately it didnt save the gears

  On the topic of wheelies the other day I saw a kid on a big Hurricane
do a stoppy or rear wheelie Man he had the rear end on this bike 
up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light I dont recommend these
activities anymore now that Im an old guy with kids of my own but
it looked damn impressive

  If you cant keep both tires on the ground at least have em pointed
in that direction
