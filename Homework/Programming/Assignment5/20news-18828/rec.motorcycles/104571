Now now Keith just calm down  What are you some prohibitionist prick  The
point of Andrew Infantes posting was obvious to solicit suggestions pertaining
to the cost of insurance and the like  I dont care if you are MADD or SADD or
whatever keep it to yourself wed all appreciate that

Well simply put drinking is irrelavent  Driving drunk is indefensable and
unforgivable  There is a large differnece

But then with an attitude like yours I expect youll be dead soon  I just
hope you dont take a human being out with you
