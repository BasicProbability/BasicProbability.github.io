 The following numbers are approximate and will no doubt get me flamed
 
 Helmet new but cheap					100
 Jacket used or very cheap				100
 Gloves nothing special				 20
 Motorcycle Safety Foundation riding course a must	140
                                                         
Wow  Courses in Georgia are much cheaper  85 for both
