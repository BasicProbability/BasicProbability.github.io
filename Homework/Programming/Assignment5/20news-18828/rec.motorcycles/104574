  One of those morning just getting the coffee in me thoughts
  
  Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just Hey hows it going 
 nice to meet you on the road have a good ride
  
  1 If youre watching for other bikes to wave to it means your attention 
 is on the road where it should be and youre more likely to see cages
  
  2 It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
 youre IN a cage This is a Good Thing 


The down side is that when Im in my cage I have on numerous occasions
slammed my hand into the rolled up window in an effort to wave at
a passing biker  Ow
