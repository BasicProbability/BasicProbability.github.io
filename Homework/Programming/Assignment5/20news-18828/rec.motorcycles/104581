CB  Grf Dropped my Shoei RF200 off the seat of my bike while trying to
CB rock
CB it onto its centerstand chipped the heck out of the paint on it

CB        Do I have to be the one to say it

CB        DONT BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN
CB        FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM

CB        HELMETS GO ON THE GROUND ON A TABLE ON A CHAIR ON A SHELF OR ON
CB        ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY
CB        WILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN


Another good place for your helmet is your mirror  I kid you not If
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable I doubt I have to mention it but this trick isnt
quite so smart on a GoldWing CBR600 any GSXR or any bike with
fairingmounted mirrors

I was a little surprised though to find that you had your helmet on
your seat while you were centerstanding your bike I usually leave my
helmet on until my bike is parked if for no other reason than I
wouldnt want my helmet to be on any surface that I was about to start
tilting and jerking

I saw the quote below on a pair of Nankai racereplica leathers I think
this sort of phrase is typically known as Japlish
