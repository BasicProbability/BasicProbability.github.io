DSRiding up the hill leading to my
DShouse I encountered a liverandwhite Springer Spaniel no relation to
DSthe Springer Softail or the Springer Spagthorpe a close relation to
DSthe Spagthorpe Viking

DS        I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking  Was
DSthat the one with the little illuminated Dragons Head on the front
DSfender a style later copied by Indian and the round side covers

No Not at all The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when
forties fifties when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing
The first iteration the Springer was a boxer twin very similar to Max
Frizs famous design but with an overhead point cam see below for
more on the valvetrain The problem was that the thing had no ground
clearance whatsoever The solution was to curve the cylinder bores so
that the ground clearance was substantially increased


         Springer motor front
                 Viking motor front    

This is roughly the idea except that the bores were gradually curved
around a radius as the pistons were loath to make a sharpangled turn
in the middle of their stroke The engine also had curved connecting
rods to accomodate the stroke

The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary and still
unique overhead cam system Through the use of clever valve timing and
and extrordinarily trick valve linkage only a single cam lobe was
required to drive both overhead valves

Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation which used a
pressurized stream of oil to power the waterwheel which kept the lobe
spinning over One side effect that required some rather brutal
engineering fixes was that until the engines oil pressure came up to
normal the engines valve timing would be more or less random
resulting in some impressive startup valve damage The solution was a
little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
beast remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to
pressurize the oil system before the car is started the cage however
uses an electric oil pump Wimps

Despite this fix the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner The solution was to run even
higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly This
was feasible because it was a racing engine

With just a single overhead lobe and no pushrodshaftchain towers
because of the hydraulic system the head of the engine came to an
almost perfect point

                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical
                             it was at about a 70 degree angle to the
                             ground and this drawing doesnt show the
                             curvature because there was none in the
                             head itself The bore curve would start
                             about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                             this diagram


The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently pundits of
the day even said sensuously curved cylinders was much like a pair of
finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank Thus the
name

The Vik was a moderately successful racer lightning fast when it
worked but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
technology Eventually it was dumped when Spag finally realized that
racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made The machines
were raced for another year or two by privateers and their fate
approximately six Vikings were made plus one or possibly two
Springers Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and
down that this machine was tooled for production and that as many as
twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line However no modern
record of a production Viking has survived and most motorcycle
historians discount this story
