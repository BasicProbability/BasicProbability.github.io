Well as a few of you so aptly put it 
get off the road jerk we dont wanna hear your 
whining

Fine

Fuck off too

If you noticed it was in 91 more than two years ago
and YES Ive learned and its cost me

And yes Ive known people friends and relatives whove
been involved in drunkrelated accidents not them they were hit
and my cousin is still recovering

No I cant take back what happened

Yes it was stupid

But by reminding me about it all the time youre
neither helping me or yourself so stuff your opinion

Hey man you brought it up  I agree completely driving drunk is really
stupid and I understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it  But
DWI is endemic in our society  It is a REAL problem  And we as 
motorcyclists can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
driver  Alert readers might remember that last year I witnessed a DWI
accident right bloody in front of me and was unable to save the life 
of one of the participants as I reported here  Also drunk driving by
motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death which raises the
insurance rates forces stupidly restrictive laws and turns the public
against those of us who ride responsibly

In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue
but a genuine safety issue  So if YOU bring up the subject on recmoto
admitting having been caught DWI and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences dont expect people to respond with warm wishes
