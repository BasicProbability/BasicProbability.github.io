Hi folks		

Recently saw one post about KREME being a bad idea but that was only	
one mans opinion  	

Any one else have any experience with the stuff	



On my 59 sporty I had some pinhole leaks open up on the back seam  I kreme
it about a year ago and have had no problems at all  Be real careful as
the cleaning part of the solution is hell on paint
