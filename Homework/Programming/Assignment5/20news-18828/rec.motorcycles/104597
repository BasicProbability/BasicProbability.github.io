Hey Ed how do you explain the fact that you pull on a horses reins
left to go left    Or am I confusing two threads here

Three actually  I believe I discussed countersteering a horse
before

Basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and
neckrein  Plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and
you pull in the direction you wish to go  Neckreining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the
horses neck in the direction you wish to go  When training a
plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks  Thus when neckreining to the left the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit
which the horse is used to from his plowreining days

Are you sorry you asked yet
