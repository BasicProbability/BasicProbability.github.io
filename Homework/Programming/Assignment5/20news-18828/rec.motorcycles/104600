   Which is better  a onepiece Aerostitch or a twopiece Aerostitch


   Were looking for more than Well the 2pc is more versatile but the 
   1pc is better protection	

   Thanks in advance

What is best Books have been written on that But in regard to
AeroStich it really depends on your particular size shape and needs
If you upper and lower body are not proportional according to aero
dimensions then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching
the 2 piece suit I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it
Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road I am very
concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in
protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible I
think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a
difference One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go
somewhere and then want to walk around for a while still with jacket
you can just detach and stow the pants 

One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for
many women with standard suits Supposedly for smaller women and
petite men for that matter the 1 piece will fit better 

Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them I wish I
got 23 inches added to my pant legs I find the Long suits are not
really that long I cant imagine how short the standard suits must
be
