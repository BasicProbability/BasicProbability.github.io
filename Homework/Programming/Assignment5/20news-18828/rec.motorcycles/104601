 An apartment complex where I used to live tried this only they put the
 thing over the drivers window so they couldnt miss it 

I can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving
or something but its the BDI that chooses to start and then drive the car
in a known unsafe condition that would seem to be liable 

An effort was made to remove the sticker  It came to pieces leaving
most of it firmly attached to the window  It was dark and around
1000 pm  The sticker before being mangled in an ineffective attempt
to be torn off warned the car would be towed if not removed  A
reasonable person would arguably have driven the car  Had an
accident occured I dont think my friends attorney would have much
trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement

As a practical matter even without a conviction the cost and
inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable

As a moral matter it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so
paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker BTW it
wasnt somebodys spot it was residentonly but unassigned
parking
