I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my
stock Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention

Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle Should we
get into how many feet a bike going 55mph goes in 30 seconds or
how long it would take me to push my horn button

If we do I think youd loose  Sure youre hands already on the
throttle  And your thumb is already near the horn button  Pushing the
horn button is one simple move  Revving the throttle requires either
engaging the clutch or accelerating  The first is a more complex
manuver than a simple horn button push and the second aint too bright
when there is a potential hazard ahead  Besides the unique sound of a
horn is more effective in attracting the attention of BDI cagers than
is the sound of an engine which is what they expect to hear you are
on the road

As is usually the case a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
safety procedure

The answer is 16133 feet
