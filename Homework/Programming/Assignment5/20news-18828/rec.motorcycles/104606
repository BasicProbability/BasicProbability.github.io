                   Came around a right hand sweeper going around
 	45 mph only to find a cager going around 30 mph calmly driving 
       along with no other traffic around in my lane Not crossing 
       the line not swerving fully and totally within the southbound 
       lane of 9W one lane each direction 


And I havent even got there yet  Must have been some other Brit
