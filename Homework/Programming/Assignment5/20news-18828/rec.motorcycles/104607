 very interesting yawn stuff deleted because Im like that 

 Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if youre going to
 be able to ride a bike properly and safely But by including countersteering
 theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily right at
 the time when there are far more important matters for them to learn
 And that was my original point

 Mike


I am in complete concordance with you there Mike  I was a Silver StarRider
instructor for a while  I learnt about countersteering last year
and I have been riding bikes since 1976  We were never told about
countersteering when being taught to instruct  It doesnt seem to have
affected me or my friends or pupils  We just rode in blissful ignorance
