 If I remember correctly the reason that BMWs come with those expensive
 and relatively worthless short lived Varda batteries is cause BMW owns
 a controling interest in that battery Manufacturer                 

 Whats wrong with the BMW battery Ive never had problems and I know
 numerous people that are still using the original battery in there
 810 year old beemers

THe original battery in an 810 year old BMW may be fine  Mine lasted many
years  The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster  The mechanic
from Comp Acc told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a
new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have
problems to bring it back and theyd do it again  It seems that many of
those 30AH batteries were DOA nearDOA and always unlikely to be going
strong by the end of the warantee period on them  THere was a big batch of
bad ones and they replaced them with you guessed it  more bad ones  BMW
switched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps even if it has
less total juice  

I switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one
third fewer dollars
