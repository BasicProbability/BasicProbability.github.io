Subject Re Recommendation for a front tire

Hey folks

Ive got a pair of Dunlop sportmax radials of my ZX10 and theyve been
very sticky ie no slides yet but all this talk about the Metzelers has
me wondering if my next set should be a Lazer comp K and a radial Metzeler
rearfor hard sporttouring how do the choices stack up
