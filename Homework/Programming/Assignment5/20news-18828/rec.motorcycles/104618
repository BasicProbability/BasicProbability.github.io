Ducati 400s are REALLY slow  They dont sell them over here in US
but considering that the 750SS is not too powerful the 400 is gonna
be a dog

Oh yeah 1210 at 108 mph in the quarter is such a slug  Come on when was
the last time you used your 750s max power peak  I think maybe you should
ride one first before passing judgement there is a lot more than just
maximum acceleration 

I guess Im out of touch but what exactly is the Ducati 400 A vtwin
desmo or is it that halfavtwin with the balance weight where the 2nd
cylinder would go A 12 second 14 for a 400 isnt bad at all

Sorry I should have been more specific  The 750 SS ran the quater in
1210  10817  The last small Vtwin Duc we got in the US and the 400 is
a Pantah based Vtwin was the 500SL Pantah and it ran a creditable 130 
103  Modern carbs and what not should put the 400 in the high 12s at 105

BTW FZR 400s ran mid 12s and the latest crop of Japanese 400s will out
run that  Its hard to remember but but a new GOOF2 will clobber an old
KZ1000 handily both in top end and rollon  Technology stands still for
noone
