 Do any Honda gurus know if I can replace the 
 the front sprocket on my 1979 Honda CB750K with a slightly larger one
 I see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one
 
 Just wanting ride at a more relaxed RPM

	It can be done contact Chaparell cycle supply they ought to have
the sprocket you needwant for cheap well much cheaper than your average
dealership Hey they even had sprockets for my VF1000R which is hard to find
accesssories for
