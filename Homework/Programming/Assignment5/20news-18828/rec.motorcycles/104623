Subject Route Suggestions

As I wont be able to make the Joust this summer Job related time 
conflict     I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in 
Knoxville

Ill be leaving from Chicago and generally plan on going down along
the IndianaIllinois border into Kentucky and then Tennessee  I would 
be very interested in hearing suggestions of roadsroutesareas that 
you would consider must ride while on the way to Knoxville

I can leave as early as 522 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PM
on 525  That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on 
the way

By the way if anyone else is going and would like to partner for the 
ride down let me know  Ill be heading east afterward to visit family 
but sure dont mind company on the ride down to the Rally  Depending on 
weather et al my plan is motellingtenting thru the trip

From the Rally Ill be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway then jogging
into West Va I77 to run up 219  Marlington 28  Petersburg 
55E  I81I66E  After this point the route is presently undetermined
into Pennsylvania New York and back to Chicago by 66  Suggestions 
for these areas would be of great interest also

Many thanks for your ideas

Enjoy
