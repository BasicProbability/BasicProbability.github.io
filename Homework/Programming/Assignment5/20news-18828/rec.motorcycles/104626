   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja
   This will be the the first time Ive taken anyone for an extended ride
   read farther than around the block    Well be riding some twisty 
   fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

Id say this is a very bad idea  you should start out with something
much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head
That particular road requires full concentration  not the sort of
thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time

Once you both decide that you like riding together and want to do
something longer and more challenging then go for a hard core road
like MinesMt Hamilton

In any case its your moral responsibility to make sure that she
has proper gear that fits  especially if youre going sport
riding
