From mbeavingbnrca The Beav
Subject Re Your opinion and what it means to me

   some real stupid remarks 
 
 You and the Beav should lighten up esp the Beav  I agree that
 
   lots of serious dribble for no real reason 
 

Hey I dont really care but when someone sends me
email telling me to fuck off I get rather pissed  If he posted
to the net I could really care less but sending mail
is just childish  Mr Infante is just that an infant  Give 
him a few more years to grow up and maybe hell learn some 
network etiquette

If you cant stand the flames
and you dont have the brains
Stay out of the newsgroup

Kind of catchy nest pas
