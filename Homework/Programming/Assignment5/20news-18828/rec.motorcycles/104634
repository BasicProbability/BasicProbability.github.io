I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja
This will be the the first time Ive taken anyone for an extended ride
read farther than around the block    Well be riding some twisty 
fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

	You sonuvabitch  Rub it in why dont you  We have great weather
and great roads here unlike the rest of you putzes in the US  Nyah nyah
nyah

	 for the severely humorimpaired

This person is 100 lbs and fairly small so I dont see weight as too much
of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go
I want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and
Ive heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction were
turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional
signals for SLOW DOWN or GO FASTER or I HAFTA GO PEE etc

	Youll likely not notice her weight too much  A piece of advice
for you  dont be abrupt with the throttle  No wheelies accelerate a
wee bit more slowly than usual  Consciously worry about spitting her off
the back  Its as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers
and I guarantee shell be put off by the bike ripping out from under her
when you whack it open  Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time
out too  You and her need to learn each others body English  She needs
to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn and you need to
learn her idea of shit  Dont crash now so you dont work at cross
purposes while leaned over  You can work up to more aggressive riding over
time

	A very important thing  tell her to put her hand against the tank
when you brakethis could save you some severely crushed cookies

Have fun
