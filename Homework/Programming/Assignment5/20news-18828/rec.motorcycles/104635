I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ11001200 owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has 
not worked for you If there is already a file on this I apologize for 
asking and will gladly accept any flames that are blown my way

With the FJs large flat gas tank Id imagine that almost anything
would work Personally Im quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank
bag
