 I need the left side inverted fork for a 92 GSXR 750 so I can go to
 track practice at Nelson Ledges next weekend  

Hey what do we look like a parts store  Has it ever occurred to you to
visit your dealer and fork out the bucks for a new one  What are the
chances of someone happening to have a 92 part laying around much less
one in working condition  Sheesh some edus  

Besides I only have the right side inverted GSXR fork  Its already been
converted into a floor lamp

Its too bad that whole families have to be torn apart by something as
simple as wild dogs          Jack Handey
