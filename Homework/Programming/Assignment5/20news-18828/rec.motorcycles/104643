GS1100E  Its a great bike but youd better be damn careful  
I got a 1983 as my third motorcycle 
deleta
The bike is light for its size I think its 415 pounds but heavy for a
beginner bike

Heavy for a beginner bike it is 415 pounds it isnt except maybe in
some admans dream  With a full tank its in the area of 550 lbs
depending on year etc

Youre 64  you should have no problem physically managing
it  The seat is roughly akin to a plasticcoated 2by6  Very firm to very
painful depending upon time in the saddle

The 1980 and 81 versions had a much better seat IMO

The bike suffers from the infamous Suzuki regulator problem  I have so far
avoided forking out the roughly 150 for the Suzuki part by kludging in
different Honda regulatorrectifier units from junkyards  The charging system
consistently overcharges the battery  I have to refill it nearly weekly
This in itself is not so bad but battery access is gained only after removing
the seat the tank and the airbox

My regulator lasted over 100000 miles and didnt overcharge the battery
The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though
tending to melt their insulation  I suspect they were underspecified
it didnt help that they were well removed from cool air

Battery access on the earlier bikes doesnt require tank removal
After you learn the drill its pretty straightforward


replacement parts like all Suzuki parts are outrageously expensive

Having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles
Ill offer a grain of salt to be taken with Dales assessment


Good luck and be careful
