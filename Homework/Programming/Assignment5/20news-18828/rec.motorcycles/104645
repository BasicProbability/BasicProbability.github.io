This person is 100 lbs and fairly small so I dont see weight as too much
of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go
I want her to hold onto me     rather than the grab rail out back and
Ive heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction were
turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional
signals for SLOW DOWN or GO FASTER or I HAFTA GO PEE etc

	Ive never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the
	turns at all I find the weight shift can be very sudden and
	unnerving Its one thing if theyre just getting comfortable or
	decide to look over your other shoulder but I dont recommend having
	himher shift her weight with each turn too violent
	
	Also I think someone already said this make sure your passenger
	wears good gear I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or
	lacking other safety gear depends on how squidly I feel but I
	wont let passengers do it What I do to myself I can handle but
	I wouldnt want to hurt anyone else so I dont let them on without
	gloves jacket at least jeans heavy boots and a helmet that fits

I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that
shell want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated

	Go real easy Its amazing how solid a grip you have on the
	handle bars that your passenger does not Dont make her feel like
	shes going to slide off the back and snappy turns for you are
	sickening lurches for her In general it feels much less controlled
	and smooth as a passenger I cant stand being on the back of my
	brothers bike and I ride aggressively when i ride and I know hes
	a good pilot still everything feels very unsteady when youre
	a passenger 


Thanks
        Bob

	Show off by not showing off the first time out
