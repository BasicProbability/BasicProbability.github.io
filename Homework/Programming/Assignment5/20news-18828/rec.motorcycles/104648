  new Duc 750SS doesnt so Ill have to go back to carrying my lipstick
  in my jacket pocket  Life is so hard  
 
 My wife is looking for a jacket and most of the mens styles shes tried
 dont fit too well If they fit the shoulders and arms theyre too
 tight across the chest or something like that Anyone have any 
 suggestions Im assuming that the VPilot in addition to its handy
 storage facilities is a pretty decent fit Is there any company that
 makes a reasonable line of womens motorcycling stuff More importantly
 does anyone in Boulder or Denver know of a shop that bothers carrying any

Theres an article in Motorcycling a couple of months back specifically on  
womens attire for serious and notsoserious riding  They do mention who  
makes stuff specific for womens dimensions and what also works OK enough as  
well  Bates will make custom jackets and leathers for a reasonable charge
