I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ11001200 owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has 
not worked for you If there is already a file on this I apologize for 
asking and will gladly accept any flames that are blown my way

Ive got a Belstaff tankbag on my FJ1100 and it aint too good Its
difficult to fix it securely cos of the the tankfairingsidepanel layout
and also with the bars on full lock the bag touches the handlebar switches
so you get the horn on full left lock and the starter motor on full right
If I was buying another I think Id go for a magnetic one
