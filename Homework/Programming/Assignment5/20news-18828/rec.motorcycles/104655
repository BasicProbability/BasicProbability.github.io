	Im thinking about becoming a bike owner this year
wo any bike experience thus far  I figure that getting a 
decent used bike for under 1K the thing would pay for itself
while Im at grad school car permits are  where Im going
and who wants to ride a bus  Im looking for advice
on a first bike  best modelsyears  Im NOT looking for
an old loud roaring thing that sounds like a monster  The
quit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking

Apprec any advice

Thanks

BS
