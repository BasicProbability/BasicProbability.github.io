Subject exhaust coating

since at least one other person was interested in this

my FZRs black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired
yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an
hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand  sprayed on paint  thought
about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
i wouldnt be at all suprised if the paint worechipped off in a month

soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder
coating while extremely durable will not handle over 600 degree
temperatures  the place i talked to said they were experimenting with
some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it wouldnt
be available for months at least  they directed me to another shop that
specializes in header coating

the other shop said they have 2 coatings available  one is aluminized that
can do 1200 degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability
the other is silicon i think based and can do 1800 degrees  but is
thinner and not as durable  both coatings have a textured finish not
super smooth and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush

price for 4 1foot header pipes and a 2foot 421 collector was 100  im
planning to take the parts up friday and get them back UPS next week maybe
wednesday

sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint
considering how much abuse the pipes get from road craprocks
