mjsNo No No No All I am saying is that you dont even need to tell people
mjsthe technique of countersteering cos they will do it intuitively the first
mjstime they try to go round a corner

karrAre you sure  Remember that you can get around corners without
karrcountersteering  In fact my Experienced Rider Course instructors
karrclaimed that they could get on behind a new rider and make the bike
karrturn to whichever side they wanted just by shifting their weight
karraround even when the operator was trying to turn in the opposite
karrdirection  I admit Ive never actually seen this

Ive experienced this back when I was younger and more foolish

My first bike used to track extremely true  Going down the highway
I would set the throttle tension screw up enough to hold the gas
steady slide back on the seat and lean against the backrest riding
without any hands  If I needed to turn Id shift my weight into the
turn and lo and behold the bike would turn sans touching the bars
Granted it wouldnt turn very fast but it proves that you can turn
a bike without countersteering at least not in terms of the input
to the bar normally associated with countersteering

As Ive said I know many people who think all you do is lean and any
input theyre giving to the bar is totally unconscious  Whereas that
may be sufficient to get you down the road under normal circumstances
possibly for years at a stretch I cant think of anybody whod argue
that this is preferable to properly knowing how to manipulate the bar
in a turn regardless of what you want to call it

Except maybe for Mr Sixsmith
