Subject Insurance discount

Hola amigos

Quiero I need an answer to a pressing question  I now own two
bikes and would love to keep them both  One is a capable and
smooth street bike low and lightweight with wide power and great
brakes the other is a Beemer GS kind of rough for the city but
great on the long road and backroad  A good start at a stable but
I dont think its going to work  Unfortunately insurance is going
to pluck me by the short hairs  

Unless some insurance agent offers a multivehicle discount  They
do this all the time for cars assuming that youre only capable of 
driving one of the things at a time  I dont think Ill ever manage
to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street Turn left
accelerate the Zephyr turn right accelerate the Beemer  Does
anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
discount your rates  State Farm doesnt

By the way Im moving to the Bay area so Ill be insuring the bikes
there and registering them  To ease me of the shock can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS  Here in Tucson
they only cost me 320 full and 200 liability only for the two
per annum

Muchas gracias
