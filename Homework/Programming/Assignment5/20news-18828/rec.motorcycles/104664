   I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja
   This will be the the first time Ive taken anyone for an extended ride
   read farther than around the block    Well be riding some twisty 
   fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans

Communication  work out your own system  Or just slow down and holler
back every once in a while  At reasonable speeds even on my undermuffled
Magna we can hear each other  Its only above say 45 MPH that you 
cant really communicate

Balance New passengers are a real pain because you never know how
theyre going to react to steering  Some people catch on immediately
and lean with me  Others are completely skittish about the leaning
thing and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon  This is a
pain while turning but manageable  The WORST are the passengers who stay
perpendicular to the horizon then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn
and WHIP AROUND until theyre in the correct position  This always
screws up the line Ive picked out

Heres my personal checklist of things to tell passengers
	 attire helmet long pants bootsheavy shoes jacket
	 Keep feet on pegs at all times unless I say otherwise  Do not
	  get onoff unless I say you can  Ive had people try to dismount
	  in traffic just as Im pulling in to a parking space
	 Muffler gets HOT Nuff said
	 We get GOOD traction  Were not going to fall over  Many
	  firsttime riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn
	 Turn dynamics  sit so that you feel like youre sitting upright and
	  were going straight  Trust your butt not your eyes  if youre
	  confused close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel
	  of it  Or just hug me tight  
	 Please no sudden moves  shift your weight as desired but be 
	  gradual so I can compensate
	 Your faceplate is yours to openclose as desired
	 Trust is essential  Trust the driver me to do the right 
	  thing  Ive driven many miles on this thing and know how
	  to operate it  Enjoy the ride  This is important to
	  stress  For example one of my firsttime passwngers seemed to 
	  watch the speedo like a hawk  I drove her to the beach down 84 
	  and whever we topped 35 mph shed holler SLOW DOWN IM SCARED 
	  I humored her for a while then simply covered the speedometer with 
	  the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster
	  Problem solved  she watched the scenery instead of the
	  instruments and had a much better time  Based on her
	  experience driving a Lincoln Continental she was unwilling to 
	  trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike

Usually Ill point out the controls engine transmission brakes 
tires etc and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for firsttimers
Helps calm their nerves and gives the bike a chance to warm up

Watch out for gravel on the Mt Hamilton road  there were lots of little
mudslides after the last big rain by now many of the blind corners will
be nicely covered with a carpet of little round nearly invisible stones
It doesnt help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner on the 
first trip

Good luck  have fun
