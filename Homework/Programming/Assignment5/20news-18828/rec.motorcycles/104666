 Well as a few of you so aptly put it 
 get off the road jerk we dont wanna hear your 
 whining
 
 Fine
 
 Fuck off too

Well it still looks like youve got an attitude problem
Mr Muttonhead  You should take the comments with more
sensitivity  I still despise most people who belittle
drinking and driving since my first girlfriend was killed 
by such an asshole back in 85  Learn to take the verbal 
abuse

If you cant take the flames 
and you cant use your brains
stay out of the newsgroup
