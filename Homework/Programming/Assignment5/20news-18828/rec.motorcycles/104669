 Hi
      I am considering the purchase of a 1984 Honda 1000cc Interceptor for
 2095 CDN about 1676 US  I dont know the mileage on this bike but from
 the picture in the RV Trader magazine it looks to be in good shape
 Can anybody enlighten me as to whether this is a good purchase  
 
    Oog  I hate to jump in on this type of thread but 
 
       pass on the VF1000  Its big top heavy and carries lots of
       expensive parts
