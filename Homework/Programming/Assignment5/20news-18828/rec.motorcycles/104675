 Waving at other bikers makes more sense than just Hey hows it going 
nice to meet you on the road have a good ride
 
 2 It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
youre IN a cage This is a Good Thing 

Has anyone while driving a cage ever waved at bikers I get the urge
but Ive never actually done it

Ive had people in cages wave at me or give me the thumbs up on
occassion  I always return the wave or thumbs up  That never
happened to me until I started riding Harleys so that may have
something to do with it

Why not try waving  What bad could happen
