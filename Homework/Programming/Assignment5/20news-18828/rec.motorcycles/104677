To followup I had a bad experience w a Krypto Lock too

Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II 38x34 long something like that
that by all standards seemed like a decent piece  Until I used it anyway


  So in short the 38 cables seems to be pretty useless I would guess

  The larger cable seems to be a much better unit

  Ive got the larger cable  about 58 inch in diameter actually I think
its larger about 4 feet long which coils into a 8 or 9 inch coil with the
tubular key lock like the Ulocks  It has worked fine for me for two years
now and seems to me anyway that it is very secure  It doesnt have the
weaknesses that the Ulocks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick
supposedly is much easier to store in my tankbag than a Ulock and more
versatile  I got mine from one of the mailorder houses Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse I beleive for 42

  In combination with an ignition disable and a couple of other deterrents
all I usually worry about is vandalism
