I knew when I posted that I was going to get into trouble Now I suppose I
have to give 5 wheelie demos at the Spring Fling or something

But youre right John it is a chain drive model I think it goes around
the camshaft and up over the rocker arms or something Stolen from an early
Spagthorpe design according to urban legend
