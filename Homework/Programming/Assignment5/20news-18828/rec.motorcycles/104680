An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja

Owww

Well I hate to be a wet sock but well

I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started
riding myelf and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes  The passenger
seats are not designed for long rides  The passenger positions arent
even usually designed for short rides  I ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes  One of the
reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a BMW 

Id suggest a shorter extended ride at first  a short turn in the mountains
or some such  Then see how much pain shes in and proceed from there

The best advice Id give a beginning passenger

 Dont get on the bike until the rider says its OK and work out some sort
  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off  After I get on 
  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that Im ready and at the stop
  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off

 Keep your feet on the pegs at all times  Dont wiggle unless your rider
  asks you to 

 The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive  Echo the movements
  and lean of your rider  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable
  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn

 Get used to your riders shifting style Riders  use a reasonably
  consistent shifting style  Avoid helmet bonk  Helmet bonk is 
  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk hishers  It
  gets old real fast

 When pulling to a stop put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank  Putting your hands
  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if youre in pain
  but Im told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there

 Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while youre doing it so your rider knows youre
  still there   The guard rail isnt as safe as holding onto your rider

 Dont be afraid to ask for frequent stops if youre in pain or
  losing feeling in your feet  Passenger seats are not generally designed 
  for comfort  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand
