 Turn dynamics  sit so that you feel like youre sitting upright 
	Good advice

 Please no sudden moves
	My Ollady taps me on the shoulder to let me know she is 
	uncomfortable  I in turn am prepared for her to move about on the 
	back of the bike

 Trust is essential  
	We had 1 bad crash nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest 
	of hill on pavementpeagravel road and her actions helped lessen 
	the severity of it  As we were crashing she stayed upright in the 
	saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist  I was
	able to get the bike slowed down 1015mph before we were highsided
	She got off with a fair case of road rash and I had to have the doc 
	remove a lot of rocks from my knee  Had she panicked we would have 
	probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury
	BTW as soon at the tire went flat we went into VIOLENT tank
	slappers  This is what she rode out in a normal riding posture
