By the way Im moving to the Bay area so Ill be insuring the bikes
there and registering them  To ease me of the shock can somebody
guesstimate the cost of insuring a ZR550 and a R800GS  Here in Tucson
they only cost me 320 full and 200 liability only for the two
per annum

	My agent is Daniel Sui and hes done quite a good job
	for me  You might check with him as hes located in San
	Francisco and specializes in bike insurance
