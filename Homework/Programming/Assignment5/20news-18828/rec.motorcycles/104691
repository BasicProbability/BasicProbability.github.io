  hello there
  can anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
  comment on its handling 
  
  
     Some guy came to the OMRRA race school last weekend with number plates
     on his VMax  He didnt get more than 2 practice laps in before he pushed
     the frame too hard and it drove him into the guard rail on the back
     straight
  
     BTW  The rider was conscious and semicoherent when the ambulance
     carted him off  Thats all I know
 

 I hate to pick on someone who may have been seriously injured lets hope
 not but semicoherent sounds like a good description of someone who
 shows up at the track w a VMax in the first place

what does that make me for showing up with an old interceptor with worse
brakes and handling due to bent frame than a VMAX  and i didnt even
uh  well i was more than semicoherent when the ambulance  uh

nevermind
