 my FZRs black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired
 yesterday i bought a can of VHT 1500 degree black header paint and spent an
 hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand  sprayed on paint  thought
 about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
 i wouldnt be at all suprised if the paint worechipped off in a month

    Why not just purchase one of the Fyex exhaust bras for about 40  They
 look great and are cheaper than powder coating  I had the same dilemma and
 opted for these  I am quite pleased

ok  so whats an exhaust bra  im guessing its not a fabric thing that
straps to the pipes  does it go over the chin fairinglowers in some way
i usually dont ride with the lower plastic
