 Ive had people in cages wave at me or give me the thumbs up on
 occassion  I always return the wave or thumbs up  That never
 happened to me until I started riding Harleys so that may have
 something to do with it
 
 Ever notice little kid wave more than other bikers
              
 
 The reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to
 a wave and also good to see  I always wave when I see a kid that
 has at least noticed my bike  I figure it helps the future of the
 sport

Yeah its impossible to be a tough biker when a 5 year old
starts waving at you
