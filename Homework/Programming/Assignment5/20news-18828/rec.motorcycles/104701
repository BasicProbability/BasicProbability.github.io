	After signing the I will buy the bike if I wreck it and I will
not sue you no matter what papers they just pointed me at the bike and
said have fun I was a little nervous well a lot nervous mainly because
it is a very expensive bike and I would hate to have to buy a new one
let alone a wrecked one

Are you sure  Harleys disclaimer says if you crash we take care of
the bike you take care of you

If you were really responsible for the bike did your insurance cover
it
