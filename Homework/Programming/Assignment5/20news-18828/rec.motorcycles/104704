Im going to be buying my first bike and Im considering an 82
Honda Ascot FT500 with less than 5K miles Does this sound like a
reasonable choice Is there anything special I need to know

An 82 FT500 Ascot was my first bikeI recommend it  If anyones
interested mines for sale  Its in LA currently with a bum
starter and around 10k miles  Id like a couple hundred for it
