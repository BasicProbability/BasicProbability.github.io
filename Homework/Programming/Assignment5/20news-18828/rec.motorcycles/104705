Subject Re Question about helmets


On the other side of the fence I owned a Bieffe offroad helmet
Took what I would consider a minor fall and had visible damage
to the shell  Yes the helmet did its job  But the damageimpact
ratio was scary  I own Bell Moto5 now have taken impacts on
order of twice the Bieffe impact we do this frequently in MX
and dont even have a scratch on it after two seasons  My
recommendation is to buy high quality gear  YMMV
