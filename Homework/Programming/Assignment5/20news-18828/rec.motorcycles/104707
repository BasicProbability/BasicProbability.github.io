Zero to very fast very quickly lastest rumor is 115 hp at the rear wheel
handles like a dream in a straight line to 80100 and then gets a tad upset
according to a review in Cycle World cornering er well you cant have 
everything

  Sure you can have everything if by everything you mean fast straight line
performance AND handling  present day liter sport bikes have more horsepower
and have faster 060 and 14 mile times than the Vmax  Plus they corner
just a bit better

 Seriously handling is probably as good as the big standards
of the early 80s but not compareable to whats state of the art these days

  Very true
