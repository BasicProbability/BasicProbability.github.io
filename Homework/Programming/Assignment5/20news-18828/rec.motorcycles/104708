Ive seen solar battery boosters and they seem to come without any
guarantee On the other hand Ive heard that some people use them
with success although I have yet to communicate directly with such a
person Have you tried one What was your experience How did you use
it occasional charging longterm leaveitforweeks etc

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car
Knowing Id be selling the car in a year or so I purchased the charger
Believe it or not the thing worked  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasnt strong enough due to its low angle

I think I paid 29 or 30 for the charger  There are more powerful more
expensive ones but I purchased the cheapest one I could find

Ive never used it on the bike because I have an EZ Charger on it and
keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged
