Basically there are two ways to steer a horse plowrein and
neckrein  Plowreining steers him by keeping the reins separate and
you pull in the direction you wish to go  Neckreining steers a horse
by holding the reins together in one hand and pulling against the
horses neck in the direction you wish to go  When training a
plowsteering horse to neckrein one technique is to cross the reins
under his necks  Thus when neckreining to the left the right rein
pulls against the right side of the neck but the left side of the bit
which the horse is used to from his plowreining days

I learned when riding bareback as a kid to palmreign by just 
pushing on the right side of the horses neck with your right palm to turn 
left  a lot like countersteering So that came pretty easy to me in the 
transition to motorcycles It took a while however to break my habit of 
kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster
