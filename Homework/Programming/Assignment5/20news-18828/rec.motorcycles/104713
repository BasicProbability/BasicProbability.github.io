Subject Re Changing sprocket ratios 79 Honda CB750

Do any Honda gurus know if I can replace the 
the front sprocket on my 1979 Honda CB750K with a slightly larger one
I see this as being preferable to reducing the size of the rear one

Thats a twincam right  Theres a steel guard right next to
the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the
engine cases and its needed  Theres probably not enough room
to fit a bigger sprocket

Id be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5 ratio
change rather than adding one to the front for about 7  If you
raise the overall gear ratio too much youll impair the bikes
rideability because the gears will be far enough apart that
there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at
any given speed  Honda 750s dont have the widest of power
bands
