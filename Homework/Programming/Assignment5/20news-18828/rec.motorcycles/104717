 As a new BMW owner I was thinking about signing up for the MOA but
 right now it is beginning to look suspiciously like throwing money
 down a rathole

let my current membership lapse when its
up for renewal

In my case thats not for another 3 years so Id appreciate any
hints on what will keep the organization in business that long  And
preferably longer of course and worth being part of

Become an activist campaign for an MC insurance program for universal
driverrider training before licensing Pick a topic dear to your heart
and get the organization to act on it Barnacles dont move ships
