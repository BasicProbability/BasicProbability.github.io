 As a new BMW owner I was thinking about signing up for the MOA but 
let my current membership lapse when its up for renewal
 hints on what will keep the organization in business that long

Become an activist campaign for an MC insurance program for universal
driverrider training before licensing Pick a topic dear to your heart
and get the organization to act on it Barnacles dont move ships

Youre obviously not referring to any of the three abovequoted
individuals because barnacles dont each send 20 to the crew of the
ship to keep it moving

Get the organization to act on it is easy to say but says little
about what one really can and should do  What the organization
actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors
as far as I can see  Thats what makes it so important to vote in an
election of officers

It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active in
the state and national arenas not infighting than other MC
organizations  Should we change this  Or just join the other groups
that already are in politics

Incidentally the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at
the moment dont compare to the problems of some other groups like gun
owners  Just try to take up target pistol shooting in the Northeast
or California and I bet youll wish you only had to worry about
wearing a helmet  Why does every thread on recmoto eventually come
around to guns
