hello there
ican anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
comment on its handling 

From CycleWorld magazine 593 who usually never says anything
bad about any motorcycle

The Max certainly has motor but there are some things it is short of
It is short of chassis  It loves straight lines aimed in one it is
nicely stable  But it is not overfond of corners  Forced into one it
protests shaking its head chattering its front tire grinding its
footpegs and generally making known its preference for straight
pavement  Bumps  It doesnt like them either  Its fork isnt too bad
though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking
The shocks though which work on that shorttravel shaftdrive
swingarm are firm to the point of harshness
