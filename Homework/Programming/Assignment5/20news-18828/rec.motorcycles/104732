To those of you who have the BMW heated handgrips

	What are they like during the summer Yes you
	wiseguy I mean while they are off

	Are they comfortable 
Theyre a hard rubberlike compound I always wear some kind of glove
fingerless on the hottest days Given those two factors
Theyre OK but certainly not cushy

When I needed heated grips I made them from pieces of an old bicycle
inner tube and a cheap electric heating pad from the drugstore on top
of foam grips soft and warm  Cheaper by about a factor of 5 too
