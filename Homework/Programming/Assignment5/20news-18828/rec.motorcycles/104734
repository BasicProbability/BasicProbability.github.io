 Hey the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse see Raising Arizona had flames coming
 out of both his exhaust pipes I love to toggle the kill switch on my Sportster
 to produce flaming backfires especially underneath overpasses at night its
 loud and lights up the whole underpass

	It does  I do it to keep people off my ass  They really back
	away when they see canon fire rolling out the back of a Harley
	
	Oh yea  It raises hell with the baffles
