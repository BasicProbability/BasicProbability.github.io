The tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first 500 
miles DO NOT go over 4000 rpms and for the next 500 miles dont go
over 6000  referred to as the breakin period if you didnt know

Well if I were to do that I would never be going over 35 mph even in
6th gear  So my question is will it hurt my new cycle to take it up 
in the 67000 rpm range so that I can at least go the speed limit

But you already can go at the speed limit at 4000 rpm  All you need
to do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit

This isnt quite as silly as it sounds  If you take a nice day trip
over back roads not highways full of people trying seriously to get
from here to there then you might be able to hold 35 mph comfortably
You could easily do 500 miles over three different weekends  You
might even get to enjoy some of the scenery  Yes I know this is
probably not why you bought a 250 called Ninja
