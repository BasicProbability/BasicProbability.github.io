 While passngering on my fiances Bandit my hippack rubbed against the tail
 and left a nasty dull finish and teeny scratches Is there a way to get
 rid of these  Buff them out  Wax them out help

McGuyers makes a full line of polishing compounds and waxes Read
the lables and pick the one that matches the marks that you see on the
paint Then do both you and your fiance a favor by putting a nice
thick coat of the carnuba wax on the bike After that those little
scratches will just buff out
