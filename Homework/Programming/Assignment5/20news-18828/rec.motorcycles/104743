Greetings recmotorcyclists

Coming up labour day weekend this year Worldcon World Science Fiction
Convention will be held in San Francisco California  I am planning
to attend and have been speculating on doing my trip there by motorcycle
instead of by plane as was my initial thought 

I live and would be departing from Ottawa Ontario Canada

I had planned to take two weeks for this trip giving me 5 days travel
time on either side of the weekend

This looks like a distance of about 2800 miles 4500 km

If your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance and not
as the crow flies this is 900km a day for 5 days  If you spend the
entire time on interstates which would be a total waste of time thats
at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eatingpeeing
sightseeing etc

I was contemplating a similar trip but from Ottawa to LA or
maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx  

I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it Id
have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of
time enjoying the country around me ie stopping with a camera
meeting townspeople going to a few bars  No sense spending 2 weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump

I estimated Id need at least 45 weeks to make the trip worthwhile

I am looking for input opinions comments or snarky remarks on
1 My sanity

In question 8

2 Suggested routes  Note getting there is important and my
   schedule doesnt leave a lot of room for side trips or circuitous
   routes

Try and stay off the interstates

5 Anybody who wants to join me on this trip  For even part of the
   distance

Depending on your route and my plans I may be heading that way as far
as at least Detroit

7 Anything that comes to mind and that you think might be relevant
