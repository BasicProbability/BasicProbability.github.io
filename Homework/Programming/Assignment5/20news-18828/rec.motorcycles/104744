WhenHow do you decide that it is too windy to ride

When its too windy to stand

When youre on the road in high winds stay alert  Even more alert
than your alert cause youre on a motorcycle and theyre out to kill
you kind of alert  Be aware of the terrain and how it may funnel
wind in sudden gusts well not gusts to somebody standing there but
its gusty cause you ride through it  If you are riding in a steady
crosswind be aware of a hill that will block the wind and adjust your
lean angle  Be aware of passing trucks to your windward side your
lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave
their turbulance cone  Reducing your profile may help ie lean on the
gas tank and kiss the triple clamp  Keep a nimble hand on the
steering be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts
Keep a larger than usual buffer zone both ahead and behind and to the
side you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
countersteering  Keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror if
someone is coming up wanting to pass get out of their way early  Stop
often for short brakes extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
and physically fatiguing
