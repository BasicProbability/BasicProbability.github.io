My chain is lubed my wheel is clean after 1000km


	Careful I was similarly impressed with it at first
	But recently I have started finding RUST spots on the
	chain

	I went back to PJ1 at least the sucker never rusted
	when I was using the BlueGootm

	Spray the chain wax onto the rollers and sideplates occassionally and
rust will not be a problem
