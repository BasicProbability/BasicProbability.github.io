If you cant youve obviously waited too long or are not putting
much effort into it
MY 80 lb dog not always used to fart all the time
By making her notice it of course the smell doesnt
bother HER  and thence kicking her outside somewhat
literally she came to realize that she shoudlnt do it
at least not around me
And now two years later she still doesnt

So how big is this dog now  about the size of cow ready to burst

Whats that supposed to mean

Shes 80 lbs

Understand english 12 

She let wind break cause I fed her cheap food and not
the same thing every time  So she had to adjust to
each different brand for a while
