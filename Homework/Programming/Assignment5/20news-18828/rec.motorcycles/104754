Well if I were to do that I would never be going over 35 mph even in
6th gear  So my question is will it hurt my new cycle to take it up 
in the 67000 rpm range so that I can at least go the speed limit

I had the same inconvenience when I bought my EX500 only I could at least
go 50 mph during the initial breakin

Despite the high quality of motor oils and motorcycle engines these days
I would follow the instructions and just keep to city street riding for
the first 500 miles Heck those miles go by fast and its worth it to
know you havent possibly screwed up your engine

At the same time this has all the makings of a 6weeklong thread debating
the whole breakin topic
