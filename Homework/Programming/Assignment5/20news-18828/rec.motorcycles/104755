I have a very important question that I havent been able to find 
an answer toIve asked mechanics and others about this but no 
one can really give me an answer that satisfies me


I just bought a brand new Kawasaki Ninja 250  I am a firsttime buyer
as well as a firsttime rider and this bike seemed to satisfy all my
needs  This may be the reason I dont know the answer to this question


The tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first 500 
miles DO NOT go over 4000 rpms and for the next 500 miles dont go
over 6000  referred to as the breakin period if you didnt know


Well if I were to do that I would never be going over 35 mph even in
6th gear  So my question is will it hurt my new cycle to take it up 
in the 67000 rpm range so that I can at least go the speed limit


Any information that ANY of you could give me would be greatly
appreciated  Just send the reply to my account or if youd like
back to the net  

Thank you very much for taking the time to readreply
to this

Go the speed limit  As long as your not at the salt flats you arnt gonna 
frag yer ride  I wouldnt ride the DoD minimum until it had 500 miles on 
it but hell I do that on a good weekend
