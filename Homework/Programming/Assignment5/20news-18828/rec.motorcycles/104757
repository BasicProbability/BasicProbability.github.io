Ill supply one

Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to

I guess I was semiserious Without using my hands I lean and the bike 
turns When leaning a torque is applied at a 90deg angle to the front 
wheels axle just as in countersteering However this torque is also about 
90deg from the axis of the steering head Instead of making the 
bike lean gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn but I dont remember 
which way

Oh yeah I tried this in the driveway on the centestandas suggested 
somewhere else but it doesnt seem to work the same
