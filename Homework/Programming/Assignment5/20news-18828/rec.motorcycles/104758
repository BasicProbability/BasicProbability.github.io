 flaming tutorial for the novice Another thing to consider is
 that like Mexican food a lot of folks mistake heat for quality Subtle

 generally earn more points than four letter words or the caps lock key
 And introducing a new polysyllabic word strabismic for example is
                                           
 likely to insure that some small part of your flame will become

Zounds  Theres a blast from the past indeed  Id nearly forgotten
about the strategic significance of strabismic in rm lore  Its
really good to see it proudly displayed again although Im sure
by now that its carbs are spoogeorama from long disuse

Gosh Im tingling all over
