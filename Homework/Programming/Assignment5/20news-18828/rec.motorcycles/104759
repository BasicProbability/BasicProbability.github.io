Subject Low powered bikesscooters


Does anybody share my opinion that in bigcity traffic a bike can be so
lowpowered that for example it cant accelerate out of trouble when
necessarythe screweddown versions of bikes sold on the German
market with the different classes of liscence seems to make a lot of
middle aged men putt putt around on 2540KmHr maschines that are
constantle getting in the way of real traffic

Does anybody else have opinions on this topic
