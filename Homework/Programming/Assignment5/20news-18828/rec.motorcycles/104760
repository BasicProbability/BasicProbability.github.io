I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
the car in front but enough to manuver around it  Keep the bike in
1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in hows that for
engageddisengaged until there are two cars stopped behind you

When the next BDI cager comes screaching in simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you  You dont need to panic and do it or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine  Do is smoothly just
rapidly  The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection
than anything else particularly empty road
