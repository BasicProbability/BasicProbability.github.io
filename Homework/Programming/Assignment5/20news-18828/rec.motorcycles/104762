Subject Re Boom Dog attack

What worked for me on my RD350 was to lean towards the dog as I modulated
throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth  After a few seconds of
warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
what was so warm and got his mouthnosemuzzle burned on the pipes  One
yip and he veered away never to chase me again
