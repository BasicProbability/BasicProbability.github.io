 You really expect a cop to answer these honestly
 
 First you gotta expect a cop to be honestthats another
 story

Yeah everybody knows cops always lieand the people they deal with day in
and day out ALWAYS tell the truthNo sir occifer sir I wazznut drinking
tonight I was just playing around back there No sir I wasnt speeding
I was realy only going xxmph it was that guy next to medidnt ya see
him

Come onstereotyping cops is no better than those that stereo type us 
What say we try to show the same open mind to those around us as we would
ask for ourselvesI know its a stretchbut its worth a try


My reason for saying that was cause I if I were a cop
wouldnt go out of my way to tell people how to break the law

Would you

The part about honesty was a joke sorta

Obviously people have had bad experiences with cops
lying  Obviously nobodys perfect and nobody
always tells the truth about everything

Or are you God 14
