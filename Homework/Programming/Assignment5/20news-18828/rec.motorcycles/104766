Any lock including the Kyptonite utypes are EASY to break into if the person has
the proper supplies andor motivation 3 minutes and your bike is gone
I would be glad to explain but I dont want to contribute to any unlawful
activities 

Does this make anyones Skeptic Alarm tm go off  No offense Bill I
dont mean to say that youre not being straight but I wonder how you
know about this  Have you actually every used your secret method to break
all the different kinds of bike locks  Or are you taking someones word
for it

The fact is it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to
go into a successful bikestealing business because they read anything in
recmotorcycles  So please tell us what you are talking about  We cant
even protect against an assault or discuss methods if you dont come out
with it

See I have heard the ones about the pipes and the liquid nitrogen and the
cordless Dremel tools and a bunch of other ones  The most plausable method
I am not a bike thief so I really dont know for certain is just to put
a rod through each wheel and use four guys to just lift the bike into a
truck  This works because most people dont lock their bikes TO anything
Since that method is so childishly easy I figure a nice visible chain or
cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on
to the next bike

Hey finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours  

Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off
by such a trival tactic WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft
the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lockpicker to walk away with your
property  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned

What tactic are you referring to  If we dont know what you are talking about
we cant very well guard against it can we

For my money literally I rely on a combination of a motiondetector alarm
with pager when Im out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area CC
insurance and I try to park in obvious visible areas with lots of people
about  See if someone just plays with the bike without intention of
stealing it at least some eyes are on it and if they get too rambunctious
theyll set off the alarm

Thats for a nice bike  For a ratbike the trick is to always keep its
actual value well below bluebook so that it looks so crappy nobody would
WANT to steal it and even if they were stupid enough to you would make
a profit on the deal  

Seriously if I for instance need to go on a business trip for a week
and sadly have to leave the bikes sitting they both get a shittylooking
but useable cover locked on and both bikes locked to each other and a
curb bumper in the parking lot under the light  I usually rig the cable
locks I use aircraft cable so that if anyone pulls on either bike or
the cable joining them the Concours alarm goes off  And I have a friend
come buy every day to have a look and make sure theyre still there  The
only thing I have ever had stolen was a 60 cover and that was over 
winter storage with the battery out of the bike and thus no alarm

Oh put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through and
place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off

Thats the best that I can think of  Most of the locks I see people put
on bikes look well not too mechanically sound  I like ABUS since I have
personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot
