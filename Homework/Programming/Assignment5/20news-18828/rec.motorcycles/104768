Subject Re Good Reasons to Wave at each other

While on my bike I wave to anyone who looks  Sort of like the small town
or wide open spaces type thing that someone from Louisiana mentioned Like
when Im in Arkansas or Helena MT  Kids are especially fun  both genders
Watch it Cliff    

In the cage I usually wave to bikers  They usually dont wave back  My wife
thinks its strange but I dont care
