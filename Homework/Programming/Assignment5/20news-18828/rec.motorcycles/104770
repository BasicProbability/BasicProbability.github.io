WhenHow do you decide that it is too windy to ride

Isnt that one of those selfevident things like how do you decide that
youre out of gas

I have never experienced wind so severe it physically precluded operation
of a motorcycle  Its more a matter of deciding whether the aggravation
is more trouble than its worth  This of course depends entirely on your
own particular circumstances and personal disposition
