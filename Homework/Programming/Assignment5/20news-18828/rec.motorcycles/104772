  Nice ridin Tex I use the California DMV recommended technique
slow as you aproach said dog and wick it up as you pass Ive often

This must be the standard strategy that is taught cuz thats what they told
me to do in my Illinois MSF class It works well only you dont get the
satisfaction of kicking the shit out of some rabid hellbeast
