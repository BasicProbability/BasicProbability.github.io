 The question for the day is re passenger helmets if you dont know for 
certain whos gonna ride with you like say you meet them at a  church 
meeting yeah thats the ticket What are some guidelines Should I just 
pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet XL or should I 
maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
passenger 

If your primary concern is protecting the passenger in the event of a
crash have him or her fitted for a helmet that is their size  If your
primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws carry a real big
spare you can put a big or small head in a big helmet but not in a
small one

While shopping for a passenger helmet I noticed that in many cases the
external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL  The
difference was the amount of inside padding

My solution was to buy a large helmet and construct a removable liner 
from a sheet of 5 closedcell foam and some satin glued to the inside
surface  The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallestheaded pillion
with the liner in and a comfortable fit on my largestheaded pillion with
the liner out  Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit
