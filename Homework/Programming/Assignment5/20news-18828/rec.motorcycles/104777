Subject What do I do with OLD gasoline HELP

I have a 72 CL350 which I stopped riding about 2 years ago I upgraded
to an 84 Sabre 750  I parked it in the corner of my parking lot and planned
on draining the gas spraying oil in the tank etc to get it ready to store
Well after a lot of procrastination all I ended up doing was throwing a 
tarp on it

Well now I have to move and want to clean up the 350  I tried starting it
with someone elses battery and had no luck  My first guess is that it is
the gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas I can only
pray that I didnt trash the carbeurators  The question is what do I do
with this old gas  I am not going to run it in my Sabre and I think that
there is enough that I dont want to burn it campus police dont think
too kindly about bonfires  Dumping it isnt a great idea        

Thanks for any ideas
