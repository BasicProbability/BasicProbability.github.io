 Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
 we have all the advantages
 
 I agree with this 100 
 
 Me too for chihuahuas  The police and the military dont train
 dobermans and shephards and use them as weapons because they are so
 easy for the average Joe to defeat barehanded  You may have opposing
 thumbs but the dog has teeth so effective some of yours are named for
 him  He has IR vision better hearing and better smell than you do
 and most likely faster reflexes
 
 Youre on a motorcycle hes on paws  Roll on and blow him off  He
 doesnt even have net access
 
 Oh bull pucky Ed They use dogs because a Many people are
 scared shitless of them and b because of the nose and the
 vision and hearing Without their cop partner in attendance
 the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with
 a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force

Oh horse puckey  Without their cop partner in attendance they are less likely
to be controllable without the use of force which would kill the dog

 
 Those teeth arent very much good with an arm shoved into the
 back
 of the animals throat and held there and the neck is not

Ok  so youve disabled the dogs mouth and given up use of your arm to do
so  How bout them front and read paws and the fact that to plug up that 
mouth youve given the dog the advantage of balance

 espcially strong neither are the leg joints which can be
 easily snapped or the skull easily crushed on even the largest
 dogs

Have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of 
hardened instruments such as a baseball bat  Without the use of both arms and
full cooperation of the beastie involved its not that easy  Oh but wait
youve got your arm shoved in the dogs mouth  You lose

 Your advice is correct but a dog is still no match for a trained
 human in a fight

Oh now you qualify you earlier statement by saying a trained human  

 Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
 we have all the advantages

Most people here have not been trained to deal with a dog that wants to maul
you  get a clue
