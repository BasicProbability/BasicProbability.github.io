 On a long ride with my exgirlfriend Nancy I would notice her
 drifting off every so often 

	I swore off taking passengers over ten years ago but I recall
 Sturgis 1981 getting some strange looks because my passenger
 was reading a book  She was so engrossed that she didnt even
 notice when we hit a roadkill to make the hitoftheday
 with the riders behind us
