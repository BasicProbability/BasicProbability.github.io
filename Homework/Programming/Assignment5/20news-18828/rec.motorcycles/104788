   Yes its a minor blasphemy that US companies would  on the likes 
of AM
   Jaguar or sob Lotus  Its outright sacrilege for RR to have 
nonBritish
   ownership  Its a fundamental thing

Lotus looks set for a management buyout GM werent happy that the Elan was 
late and too pricey  If they can write off the Elan development costs the may 
be able to sell them for a sensible price


  I think there is a legal clause in the RR name regardless of who owns it
  it must be a British companyowner  ie BA can sell the company but not
  the name

  kevinhhaslerascomch

 I dont believe that BA have anything to do with RR  Its a seperate
 company from the RR AeroEngine company 

Its Vickers who own Rolls Royce cars 

And yes Kevin it is posts Morgan use a sliding pillar front suspension

Ob Bike at long bleeding last When will that Pettefar bloke get a mail 
address so we can bung him on the Ogri list
