Hi Janice

I dont know if Im being unduly cautious but I wouldnt buy a used helmet not for normal road use anyway You never really know whats happened to them in their past life 

Have fun

Ill second that I saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was 
unwise to buy secondhand  stuff like parachutes toilet paper condoms
and motorcycle helmets

Seriously though why take the risk You are extremely unlikely to get
a goodfitting secondhand helmet cos life just doesnt work like that
And as Lisa says you never know where its been before
