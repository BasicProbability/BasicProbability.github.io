 	For those of you with motorcycles of the liquidcooled persuasion
 what brand of coolant do you use and why  I am looking for aluminumsafe
 coolant preferably phosphatefree and preferably cheaper than 13gallon
 Can you believe it  the Kaw dealer wants 495 a QUART for the Official
 Blessed Holy Kawasaki Coolant  No way Im paying that usury
 
 Thanks

I thought that all coolants were aluminum safe any more But I would
like to know more since I must tear down my Kawasaki again I must add
