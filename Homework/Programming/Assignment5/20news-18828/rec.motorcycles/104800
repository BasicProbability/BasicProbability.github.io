Subject Re Krypto cables was Re Cobra Locks

To followup I had a bad experience w a Krypto Lock too

Last year I bought a Krypto Cable II 38x34 long something like that
that by all standards seemed like a decent piece  Until I used it anyway
Before I ever used it for security purposes I used it for entertainment
minds out of the gutter please which is to say that I sat fiddling w
it while watching TV the night I got it  After three minutes of mindless
fiddling of course it was mindless remember I was watching TV the entire
tumbler mechanism came out on the key  Not unlike that old Georgieporgie
nursery rhyme  This left a very empty cylinder and a very nonsecure 
read swingin in the breeze cable lock
Kinda makes me wonder about any flat keystyle lock  One yank w a 
slidehammer and Viola Im making an insurance claim

Anyone else have a similar experience w the Kryptos not bike theft
