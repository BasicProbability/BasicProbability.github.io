 Newbie Sorry to disappoint you but as far as the Internet goes I was
 in Baghdad while you were still in your dads bag
Is this bit funny

 Most of the people who made this group interesting 3 or 4 years ago
 are no longer around and I only have time to make a random sweep
 once a week or so Hence I missed most of this thread 
Im terribly sorry

 Based on your previous postings apparently devoid of humour sarcasm
 wit or the apparent capacity to walk and chew gum at the same time I
 assumed you were serious Mea culpa
I know I know Subtlety is sort of you know subtle isnt it

 Still its nice to see that BNR are doing so well that they can afford
 to overpay some contractors to sit and read news all day
Thats foreign firms for you


and a touchy newbie at that

Whats the matter too much starch in the undies
