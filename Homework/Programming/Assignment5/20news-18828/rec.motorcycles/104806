 If Satan rode a bike CB1000 would you stop to help him

 Of course We riders have to stick together you knowBesides
 hed stop for me

 Satan by the way rides a Vincent So does God

 Jesus rides an RZ350 the Angels get Ariels and the demons
 all ride Matchless 500s

 I know because they talk to me through the fillings in my teeth

 Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of
 separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time
 struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing

I think that the Vincent is the wrong sort of bike for Satan to ride
Honda have just brought out the CB1000 look in BIKE Magazine which
looks so evil that Satan would not hesitate to ride it  17hole DMs
Levi 501s and a black bomber jacket  Im not sure about the helmet
oh I know one of those Darth Vader ones  There you go  Satan
Anybody seen him lately  Just a cruisin

God would ride a Vincent White Lightning with rightous injection
Hed wear a onepiece leather suit with matching boots helmet and gloves
