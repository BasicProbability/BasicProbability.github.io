Now just wait one cotton picking minute here DoD rule 41712 section 6
paragraph 3 clearly indicates that multiple people cant lay claim to a bike
in an obvious ploy to artificially increase the size of their stable

So the question of the day is Is Spike owned by a lady of true class and
breeding my definition any woman who rides   or by Tom the harely head
I also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport Like I said 
obviously a lady of discriminating taste

Bored minds wanta know
