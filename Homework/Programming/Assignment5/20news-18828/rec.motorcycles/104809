duck Squids dont wave or return waves ever even to each
       
    excuse me for being an ignoramus but what are these


Squids are everybody but me and you  Chris Behanna is especially a squid

A squid is the guy I saw back in December on cool 40 degree morning on my way
to work He was wearing kneelength pants light jacket no gloves though he
was going considerably slower than DoD nominal

A POSER squid was the guy I saw yesterday on my way home  Similar attire as
above sans jacket it is April in Texas ya know but he is riding down the
freeway left hand on his side kinda Robinhoodlike with his body turned
slightly left  Brings a whole new meaning to the term POSER
