Subject Re Need advice for riding with someone on pillion

A few random thoughts on riding with a passenger

Theres no substitute for a bike with sufficient power having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small 125 etc bikes I used to
ride in the UK it was hard  Im now riding a GS1100 and thats great
even moving from my freinds GSX600 I was riding recently This may be due
in part to the fact that neither I nor my regular passengers are
particularly slimline 

I always tell passengers stay in line with the bike on corners that makes
their movements predictable

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all
I dont really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods
Again that may be biased by the fact that Ive had a couple of new passengers
a friend recently for her first time on a bike who hold on to me real tight
making any kind of maneuvering difficult

Ive also discovered that on longer trips I prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit I recently took a work collegue to a meeting about
a 1 hour ride and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back

We have a code system for turns stop and for I need to shift position
