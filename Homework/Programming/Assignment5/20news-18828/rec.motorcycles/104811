Subject Hawk GT new seat review

Unable to stand the pain anymore my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter
and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT

It came with no instructions but it came 2 weeks earlier than they
said it would  Installation would have been very easy but the seat
fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with
the stock seat  It never was easy to put on  Once I figured that
out the new seat went on the first try  The passenger backrest though
does not fit as I thought it might  The supplied screw to set the 
backrest angle does not fit and I have not yet found a suitable 
hard  SAE grade 8 or perhaps 5  1420 bolt that fits  There is a
a soft bolt in there now  just dont lean back

The drivers section of the seat is a bit wider  Seems comfortable
enough but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat
without a thought  The passengers section has about 8 times the 
volume of foam that the stock seat has and from my short test it
seems much more comfortable  The backrest helps a bit but Ive not 
has enough time to really test it  The backrest also comes with a 
small pocket  Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 
10 taller seat

If I go on the threenotch ride soon  Dixville Pinkham  Smugglers
Ill give a more complete report but in general it seems like an
improvement
