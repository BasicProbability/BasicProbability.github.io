Subject Re  Shaftdrives and Wheelies


Various posts about shafties cant do wheelies

  No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
  of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
  off the ground

Good point Johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when I had my
BMW R80GS I dumped the clutch at 5000rpm hey ito nly revved to 7 or so and
you know what He was right

Uh folks the shaft doesnt have diddleysquatpoop to do with it I can get
the front wheel off the ground on my 5 ferchrissake
