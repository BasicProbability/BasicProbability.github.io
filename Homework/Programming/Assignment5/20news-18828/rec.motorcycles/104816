Hi there kids and kidlets


It your ol pal the KotPM  Keeper of the Pin Money


Ive got good new and bad news

	Good news  I got laider
	The pins will be coming to use the computer software phrase  real
	soon now

	Bad news  Right after we placed our order the company upped its
	minimum order for manufacturing  We got in under the wire with
	an order of 115 or so pins but as a result of the low number of
	pins we were relegated to the well get to it inbetween other
	runs bin  As a result it seems that it may be another 4 or 5 weeks
	until your beloved Geeky is guiding you along the blacktop  And
	we thought madonnas on the dashboard were foolish hmmm now if that
	were Madonna sitting on my dashboard that could be DANGEROUShell
	Im tough

   SOplease continue to be patient  As soon as they arrive Ill post
   	the grand announcement and rush our Messiah on his way directly
	to your abode  In the meantime if you need revised versions of the
	holy word of Geeky please send 1595 cash or money order no CODs
	to
