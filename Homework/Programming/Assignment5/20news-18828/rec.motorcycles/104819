  2 It keeps you in the habit of watching really carefully for bikes when 
 youre IN a cage This is a Good Thing 
 
 Has anyone else ever caught themselves waving at oncoming motorcycle riders
 while in a car

Sure It has caused my wife to conclude that I am totally insane not just
partially

Usually I just lift the left hand off the wheel and wave thru the
windshield Damn near the same motion as on the bike
