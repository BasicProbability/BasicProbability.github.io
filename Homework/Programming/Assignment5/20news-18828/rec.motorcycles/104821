I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ11001200 owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has
not worked for you If there is already a file on this I apologize for 
asking and will gladly accept any flames that are blown my way

With the FJs large flat gas tank Id imagine that almost anything
would work Personally Im quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank
bag
 

I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment
straps  Most come with 3 and some with 4 I have a Bagman 4 strap
tankbag and because the rear of the tank is so narrow the fit
is not optimal
