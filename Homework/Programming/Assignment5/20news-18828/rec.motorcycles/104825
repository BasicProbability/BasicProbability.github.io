So the question I have is HOW DANGEROUS IS RIDING            
 
 Its exactly as dangerous as it looks Youre hard to see and have little
 protection Keeping out of trouble means knowing your limits keeping your
 machine in good shape and being able to predict and make up for every stupid
 move that drivers make out there We deal with it because its fun but
 staying alive takes a conscious effort

Thanks Jody I cant say Ive ever seen it summed up so succinctly before   
I might only add two things stupid road design or poor at least and
we deal with it for the fun and brotherhood we share with others who take 
their lives in their hads to feel the wind in their hairIMHO
