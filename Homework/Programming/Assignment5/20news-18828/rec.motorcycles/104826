What a dog weighs 150lb maybe at max You cant handle it

You have I presume thumbs Grapple with it and tear its head
off

Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
we have all the advantages


This was a recent discussion on recmartialarts  Humans definitely dont
have all the advantages Dogs are deceptively strong and often bred for
fighting of one sort or another
