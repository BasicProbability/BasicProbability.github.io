Subject Re Krypto cables was Re Cobra Locks

Hi

Im not sure what the other guy cant track down his post for his name
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable
They are  Theres a space between each link where the teeth of the 
locking head notch in  Thus each link is a possible locking point

Also and this is not applicable to hardcore thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxyacetylene torches the cobralinks LOOK a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks IMHO and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat
crackingunsecuredbike deterrence as long as the lock is nominally 
functional

Finally I notice that when I ride with my leathers harness boots and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier BTW Ive crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didnt pulverize any vertebrae cagers give
me a much wider berth dont hassle me and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre80s Honda dinosaur
I think I have a pavlovian drool reflexI put the lock on ie on my
body and I can feel the bike already shaking away

My first post  What did I do wrong
