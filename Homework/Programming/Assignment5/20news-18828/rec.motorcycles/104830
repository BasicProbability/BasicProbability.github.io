Subject Re Need advice for riding with someone on pillion

Because riding a passenger doesnt really depend on the type of bike
The things you want a passenger to donot do is the same  Ergo if hes
asking advice I reasoned he doesnt have much practice period  If
you say he does fine  I still wouldnt take the uninitiated up a
road thats all switch backs and reversecenteruncrowned roadway not
to mention the BDCs and squids who will also be on that particular
road  He asked for advice and even though it wasnt what he meant
I still consider it some of the best Ive read
