being a mere female I have often found I cant really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers so I found a more subtle and nastly
ooops I mean nasty way to get back at them If somebody cuts you up just wait till they have pulled out past you and then gently lean over and
bend their aerial every time I have done that it has eventually snapped
off near the base  which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace

Dear Gillian

That is such a wickedly cool idea why didnt I think of it However here
in Canada the aerials antenna are usually near the driver or passenger areas
and I would surely be seenbut Ill give it a try anyway

Thanks for the first truely useable piece of information I have heard in a long
time and you are by no means a mere female as this way at getting back takes
real guts to do
