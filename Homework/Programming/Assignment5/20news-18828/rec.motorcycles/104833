What a dog weighs 150lb maybe at max You cant handle it

You have I presume thumbs Grapple with it and tear its head
off

Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
we have all the advantages


This was a recent discussion on recmartialarts  Humans definitely dont
have all the advantages Dogs are deceptively strong and often bred for
fighting of one sort or another

Being related to former trainers I have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages well at least one anyway It is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow I
was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dogs throat The dog would naturally gag and release and become
momentarily disoriented This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined  Proof Positive  In the time during the dogs
disorientation the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness  from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow  Finally run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed

OOOOOOOpsssss For a second there I thought I was in recbeatthelivingcrapoutofadog
