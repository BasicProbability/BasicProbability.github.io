 There have been a lot of posts lately about I wanna buy my first bike  is a
 GSXRZXCBRFZR a good bike to learn on etc

Sure they are Here we can buy

GSXR250
CBR250
FZR250

The prob is that youre wrong
Newbie here
I just got off the phone with a salesman
that showed by newbieness

If I remember what he said correctly
GSXR250  no such thing
CBR250  NO   Its CB250
FZR250  no such thing

Most sport bikes dont have 250 versions
