So how do I steer when my hands arent on the bars Open Budweiser in left 
hand Camel cigarette in the right no feet allowed If I lean and the 
bike turns am I countersteering Is countersteering like benchracing only 
with a taller seat so your feet arent on the floor

Now while I wouldnt recommend doing this while moving

Maybe Mike Beaverton can complain to you awhile  

you might not want to countersteer if youre just sitting
in the driveway

sounds of Rick falling off bike muttering Damn coulda
sworn thats how they told me in the MSF course 


 
Andy Infante   You can listen to what everybody says but the fact remains
