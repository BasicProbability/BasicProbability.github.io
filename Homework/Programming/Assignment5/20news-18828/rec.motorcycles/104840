Subject Two Beemer Questions R80GS

Hello Folks

Im very happy with my new R80GS  My range is 238 miles on 48 gallons
thats 50 mpg  Surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  I was expecting
something rough   Shes a sweet backroad honey  And I can go pretty much
anyplace Id take my mountain bike  As far as shaft effect its more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  Rev it sitting still
when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  Maybe
I dont ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence  Okay here are 
my questions

1 Any recommendations for a homemade fairing  Id like to keep the
wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds
70 mph yet dont want to a screw up the stability or b block my
vision too much for trail riding  Anybody have luck with twopiece 
detachible fairings  Id like to make it myself out of plexiglas

2 I run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar  The illuminations excellent that way with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it 
really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day  But Ive heard that BMW alternators
dont crank out too much  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when Im
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM  

3 This is embarassing Im having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning  I invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section
of the paper and then she starts right up  Is this a Zen thing 

4 The Haynes manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives Yeah right  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best  Additives

Thanks
