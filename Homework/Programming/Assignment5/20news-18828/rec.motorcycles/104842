Now just wait one cotton picking minute here DoD rule 41712 section 6
paragraph 3 clearly indicates that multiple people cant lay claim to a bike
in an obvious ploy to artificially increase the size of their stable

Silly boy You read the rest of that jibberish go back and read rule
1

So the question of the day is Is Spike owned by a lady of true class and
breeding my definition any woman who rides   or by Tom the harely head

OK for the record Spike is jointly owned The registration says or
Uhhh what does the title say Beth Beth brought the ad to my
attention Id been half heartedly lusting after an SR500 for years I
had successfully avioded buying it by rationalizing that I didnt need
to spend the  on it Then Beth piped up with Ill pay for half of
it I was beaten 

I also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport Like I said 
obviously a lady of discriminating taste

Watch it buddy Both of those are fine rides Beth loves riding
pillion on the Connie true the Ol Sport isnt her cup of tea she
cant get it off of the side stand but she agrees that its a very
fine ride

Bored minds wanta know
