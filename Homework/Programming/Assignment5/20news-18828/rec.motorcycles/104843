	Yep I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision I should mention  
that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over   The wheelie was  
the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an  
intersection damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers  

	However I have done one by myself it just takes a lot of  
preclutch dump rev action

	just a passing comment
