 What worked for me on my RD350 was to lean towards the dog as I modulated
 throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth  After a few seconds of
 warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
 what was so warm and got his mouthnosemuzzle burned on the pipes

 A bicycling technique Ive
employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog
attacks

One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
his megabuckmicromass bike He said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel The dog had no idea what hit him and he
fled quite rapidly Then again he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp so I dont think Id care to try this one on a motorcycle

The telephone worked much better than the tire pump

Thats almost unfair Ive never seen a dog that could use a phone
