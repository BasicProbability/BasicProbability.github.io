Sheesh even a trained attack dog is no match for a human
we have all the advantages

I agree with this 100 

Me too for chihuahuas  The police and the military dont train
dobermans and shephards and use them as weapons because they are so
easy for the average Joe to defeat barehanded  You may have opposing
thumbs but the dog has teeth so effective some of yours are named for
him  He has IR vision better hearing and better smell than you do
and most likely faster reflexes

Youre on a motorcycle hes on paws  Roll on and blow him off  He
doesnt even have net access

Cmon Ed

a  All things have their weak areas
b  Whats IRIdiot ResponseDogs have more Rods or Cones Im not sure
    which than humans and this allows their eyes to collect more light in lower
    light conditions Consequently their colour vision is almost nonexistant I
    mean if dogs had built in infrared vision the armed forces would be
    strapping them to missiles instead of paying a quarter million for IR guidance
    capabilities
c  My dog has net access
