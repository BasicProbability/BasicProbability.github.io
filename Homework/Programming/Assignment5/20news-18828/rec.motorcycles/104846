Ever notice little kid wave more than other bikers
             

The reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to
a wave and also good to see  I always wave when I see a kid that
has at least noticed my bike  I figure it helps the future of the
sport

Dont forget little girls  My notquite2 year old daughter now
excitedly points and says motorcycle every time she sees one go
past  Ive done my work  Of course it helps that one of her
books shows Sir Topham Hatt in a chaffeured side car rig

I have to admit that I usually try to do so without the parental
figure noticing  Im afraid that the kid will get yelled at for
associatign with antisocietal types like us

Can you think of a better way to convince the kid that someday Ill
ride one of those things

Is it a genetic thing with little boys or what  Even three and four
year old boys seem magnetically attracted to motorcycles of virtaully
any sort often to the dismay of thier mothers 

No its a genetic thing with little humans

Just dont let them touch hot pipes
