Subject FOR SALE 550 ZEPHYR

Hi boys and girls  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that 
I am a grad student  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my 
Zephyr too

If I can sell it this month great  insurance and tags both run out in
a couple of weeks  Otherwise Ill tag and insure it and see what happens

Its a very sweet bike  6100 miles almost all highway AZWYCO last summer
plus some great rides between here and the Border  Purchased new exactly
one year ago Apr 92 its a 90 model  It has a good fairing and a
luggage rack  Red very clean  Perfect maintenance no bullshit   Ill spare
any further details other than to say 1 I want to keep it and 2 somebody
57  5 will fit it like a charm  Not a bike for big people but not a
small bike  Standard upright positioning and goodlooking  Smooth power
great brakes good Karma
