you presumed you needed to split out a GS list
by implication of your split a plain ol bmw
list wouldnt meet the GS riders needs

for the sake of not forcing the split issue
how about changing the charter and renaming
your list from bmwgs to just bmw  would that
make everybody happy

i think youd get better participation this way
and joe wouldnt have to burden his 286
