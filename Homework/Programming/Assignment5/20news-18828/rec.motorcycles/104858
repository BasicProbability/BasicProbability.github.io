Subject      Re Well blow me down yukyukyuk

I have never experienced wind so severe it physically precluded operation
of a motorcycle  Its more a matter of deciding whether the aggravation
is more trouble than its worth  This of course depends entirely on your
own particular circumstances and personal disposition


and skill  If you havent done it before it can be dangerous  It takes
some getting used to  Read Eds list
