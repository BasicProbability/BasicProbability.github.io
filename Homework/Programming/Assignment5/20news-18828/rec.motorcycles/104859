        What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under
 Influence so here what does W stand for 
 
 Driving While Intoxicated
 
   Actually I beleive DWI normally means Driving While Impaired rather
 than Intoxicated at least it does in the states Ive lived in
 
 This was changed here in Louisiana when a girl went to court and won her 
 case by claiming to be stoned on pot NOT intoxicated on liquor
 
   One can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor  drugs
 not enough sleep being a total moron  all can impair someone etc  Im
 surprised this got her off the hook  Perhaps DWI in Lousiana is confined
 to liquor
 
 Lets just say it is DUI here now

OK It varies from state to state It has to do with operating a vehicle
while there is greater than a given percentage of alcohol in your
bloodstream Can we drop this now and get back to asking Ed Green to
getabike
