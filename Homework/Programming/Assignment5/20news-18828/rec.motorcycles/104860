 Well sounds great to me When I have a real BDI cager tailgating me
 Ive found that an effective strategy is to flash my brake light by
 pumping the pedal You will obviously need a bit of free play in your
 brake pedal to do this It seems that even the most brain dead idiot can
 usually discern that a flashing red light directly in front of
 himherit may mean that something is wrong

Sometimes yes sometimes no BDI cagers usually move back then
Hyperagressive assholes just move closer Something about
testosteronestimulated behavior I think Its kinda like waving a red
flag at a bull All in all if you cant move over and let the jerk by
its better than nothing
