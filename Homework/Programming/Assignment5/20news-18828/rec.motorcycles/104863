Subject MOA members another letter to read


In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap
that is going on in the MOA which some folks took not as dissemination 
of information that I received but as my own bad mouthing I thought that
I would post this one which came to me yesterday  This is from board member
Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse  This is NOT my words OK guys

                                   April 4 1993

re  Cecil Kings Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year  Cecil Kings nominating statement as it appeared in the
Owners News is 968 words nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the bylaws  In pertinent part the rules state

Each candidates biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task  Had Cecils
statement been cut as required it would have concluded approximately with
the word undertiding sic in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement  As a result Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president  This does
not just taint the election for that office it makes a mockery of the 
process  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election
     Parenthetically in your private correspondence with others I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an asshole you remind the
letters recipient that the republication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences
   With kind regards I remain
                                 Robert Higdon

OK MOAers You read it think for yourself I trust you do know who
Cecil King is and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass and he is
a pres candidate  I let you draw your own conclusions
