I bought it I tried it
It is truly the miracle spooge
My chain is lubed my wheel is clean after 1000km

Id try it on the VFR but goddamn Competition Accessories hasnt mailed my
order yet  Hell its only been two weeks and I was ordering some pretty
bizzare stuff  Like a clear RF200 face sheild and a can of Chain Wax
Bastards

For what its worth I got my can in three days from Chaparral Thats
UPS ground from CA to UT YMMV The stuff seems to work and it doesnt
attract grundge like PJ1 Blue does I gave it the acid test a full
days worth of breaking in the Quadracers new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes If theres anything wet  stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day but the chain looked pretty clean

As far as mailorder goes if Chaparral has it in stock and they can
tell you if its in stock or about how long it will take to backorder
it if its not I usually get it in three days Competition Accessories
always seems to take a week or two to deliver Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse also takes a week or two and after trying to buy some boots
from them last week I dont think they actually stock anything MAW was
about 30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots but on
Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week so I asked MAW a
completely unreasonable question Do you have them in stock The
conversation went something like this

I need to know if you have some boots in stock

	Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard

I want to know if you have them in stock

	Well the computer doesnt show anything Id have to call the
	distributer to find out if we have them

So do you have them or not

	Dont you understand what Im saying I have to call our
	distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not

Uh right So can you do it

	Yea call me back in an hour and ask for Phil

So an hour later Phil isnt there but Mike says hell check and call
him back in half an hour Half an hour later Mike isnt there either
but he left a note that says theyll have them by the end of the month
3 weeks away Screw it the 30 bucks isnt worth the hassle I called
Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock

	Ooh Alpinestars Probably not they are hard to keep in stock
	but Ill check What size

Size 10

	Lets see yes Size 10 in blue  white gray  white black

Ill take the blacks

This was about noon on Monday they arrived Thursday morning Once
again three days via UPS ground I like Chaparral

Im not completely down on MAW they often have lower prices but be
prepared to wait

Oh and if anyones in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff
Scorcher seems like a good outfit friendly fast had the tires I
wanted in stock and were cheaper than Chaparral too
