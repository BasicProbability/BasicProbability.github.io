Well I watched the Daytona race on TNN  Boy for the people who saw
it
Was the Yamaha a lot faster than the Kawi or what  on the last
stretch the Yami took of and left the Kawi in the dust  I am a Kawi
rider and am totaly disappointed in the Kawi

  It wasnt that the Lawsons VH OWO1 was faster  If you watch the tape
again Russell had major backmarker problems before getting onto the banking
It doesnt matter what bike you have if you lose your drive your hosed

  The two bikes are almost identically fast  Check out the qualifying times
