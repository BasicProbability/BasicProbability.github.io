Subject Re Need advice for riding with someone on pillion

In article mjs735489679zensysueaacuk mjssysueaacuk Mike Sixsmith writes
if Im riding I would far sooner have the pillion hanging on to the bike
rather than me because I find that their weight can cause me to move
and that can upset the balance of the bike Most of the pillions I see 
over here hold the grabrail The really good ones dont hang on to anything
unless violent acceleration is taking place

Hmmmmndont you ride with your sweetheart
