To those of you who have the BMW heated handgrips
      Are they comfortable Do they transmit a lot of
      vibration How do they compare to the stock grips
      To foam grips 

I dont have the grips but have looked into getting them its my 
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european 
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes K1100RS K1100LT etc
its also my understanding that the heater resides inside the bar 
itself so if anything I would suspect it would reduce vibration by 
providing more bar end mass

I dont see why they wouldnt work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100 degree texas summers

Someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order  The were 
aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the 
grip itself  Wires ran outside of the bars from the grips to a switch and 
finaly the battery  Cycle Magazine tested them YEARS ago and liked them  
Dunno if they are still made  Might check with the snowmobile racers
