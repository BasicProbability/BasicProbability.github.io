I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ11001200 owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has

With the FJs large flat gas tank Id imagine that almost anything
would work Personally Im quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank
bag

I think the only thing to watch for is the number of attachment
straps  Most come with 3 and some with 4 I have a Bagman 4 strap
tankbag and because the rear of the tank is so narrow the fit
is not optimal

Good point Id overlooked that The Eclipse has a 3 point mount 1 at
the rear and 2 at the front and its very stable on the FJ I have seen
some with harnesses that mount to the sides of the tank and that would
be a real problem on the FJ
