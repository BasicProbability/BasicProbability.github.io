lotsa stuff deleted

 Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be 
  sure and squeeze your thighs while youre doing it so your rider knows youre
  still there   The guard rail isnt as safe as holding onto your rider

Hmmmm  why does everyone on that side of the Pond seem to want
pillions to hang on to the rider rather than the grabrail 

Because Im a guy and most of my pillions are female 

Also the other reasons like having an idea where you passengers
weight is it being a more comfortable position for the passenger
and it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well

Holding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking when you
dont want the pillion to slide forward into you otherwise I dont
find it works well
