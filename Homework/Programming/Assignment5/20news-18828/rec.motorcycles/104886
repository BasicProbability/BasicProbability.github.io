 I just got back from the 11th Annual Southern California Harley Dealers
Association Run to the Colorado river city of Lauglin Nevada

Why is it that some people cant enjoy themselves without being assholes

If you want to be treated with respect you need to treat others their 
property and their towns with respect

Several years ago I was at the Annual Flyin of the Experimental Aircraft
Association EAA near Oshkosh Wisconsin Although approximately 100000
people were in attendance there was not a piece of litter anywhere  Everyone
was considerate enough to place their trash where it belonged

Theres no problem in having fun raising hell etc  But consideration
and respect for others is critical we need to work WITH each other not
against

Nudity fineloud noise fineparty all night fine but at the right
place and time  Please lets not trample over others rights and then bitch
because they dont treat us like gods

Michael Menard

 You know I wasnt EVEN going to respond to this typical antiparty
attitude message Trash was everywhere  reason Not enough dipsy
dumpsters for the massive crowd Oatman wasnt prepared for the vast
number of PEOPLE that showed up
 BTW Michael Oatman is the RIGHT PLACE  TIME Its called a RUN Maybe
you didnt read my comment that They loved us and Im talking about the
merchants and townspeople The merchants that didnt want us  their shops
were closed
  Maybe I should have mentioned that when I left  the trash was being
picked up aluminum sells by a crew assigned to the task
  I think the bottom line here is do they want us back  They Do
This action that went on at Oatman is TYPICAL on a predominatly Harley
run Its innocent fun
  So since I enjoy TYPICAL Harley fun at Runs  in your eyes that makes me
an asshole Ive already admitted Im an asshole many times on the net
All my friends are assholes too lyrics to a new song So you want a
dime to call someone that cares
  It appears we have a difference of opinion Maybe you should look at the
big picture before you pass judgement on others 11th Annual That should
tell you something
