Ive tried it with some success before but it wont work on a Charlie Manson
dog or one thats really really stupid  A large Irish Setter taught me

a game with me  The game was probably Kill the VERY ANGRY Neighbor Before 
He Can Dispense the TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT

What a dog weighs 150lb maybe at max You cant handle it

Look if you are worried about being attacked by a dog just carry
some Spot remover with you
