Subject Re Your opinion and what it means to me

In article 1993Apr2020483119788rtsgmotcom svobodartsgmotcom David Svoboda writes

In my view drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence
It is one of the traffic offenses which is NOT a public funds issue
but a genuine safety issue  So if YOU bring up the subject on recmoto
admitting having been caught DWI and looking for sympathy over the 
consequences dont expect people to respond with warm wishes

Dave Svoboda svobodavoidrtsgmotcom     Im getting tired of
90 Concours 1000 Mmmmmmmmmm                beating you up Dave

By not being able to drive for a year it was close enough to jail

And BTW where the hell did I ask for sympathy

I asked what to do about insurance not about my life

FWIW if everyone was honest on this group Id
others besides me that read this have had a DWI too

 
Andy Infante   You can listen to what everybody says but the fact remains
