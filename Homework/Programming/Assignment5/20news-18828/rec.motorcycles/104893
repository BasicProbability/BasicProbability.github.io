  I have a large ol farting dog and have made a real effort at trying
to train him but he still just flatulates at will

Dont feed it so much
Seriously

  First I would like to break him of this and then Ill worry
about his chasing things


If you cant youve obviously waited too long or are not putting
much effort into it

MY 80 lb dog not always used to fart all the time

By making her notice it of course the smell doesnt
bother HER  and thence kicking her outside somewhat
literally she came to realize that she shoudlnt do it
at least not around me

Sort of like that scene in 10 in the ministers study when the
secretary lets one fly and the startled dog runs from the room
The minister explains Every time Mrs Soandso breaks wind we beat the dog
