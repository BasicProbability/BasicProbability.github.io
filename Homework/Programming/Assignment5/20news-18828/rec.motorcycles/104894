Theres also Billy Jack The Wild One Smokey and the Bandit
Where Jerry Reed runs his truck over Motorcycle Gangs Bikes
and a video tape documentary on the Hells Angels I
found in a rental store once


Dont forget Robert Blake in Electra Glide in Blue where else do
you get to see a fulldress Harley playing with dirt bikes
And if youre going to count Smokey and the Bandit then you darn
well better include PeeWees Big Adventure
