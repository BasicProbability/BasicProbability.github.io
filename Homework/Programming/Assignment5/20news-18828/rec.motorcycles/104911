 WhenHow do you decide that it is too windy to ride

  When the bugs are splatting on the side of my helmet instead
  of the faceshield  When semis are on their side in the downwind
  ditch  When I cant see the road for all the tumbleweeds rolling
  past  When the airborne sandgravel is sandblasting my paint job
  When all of the above is happening at once in the middle of Wonderful
  Wyldoming

  Well it WAS gusting to 87 mph

  Cheers
