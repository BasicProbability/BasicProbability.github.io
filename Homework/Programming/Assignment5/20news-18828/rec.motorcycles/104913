Subject Re BMW heated grips

Orating with wild abandon prangenickelucsindianaedu Henry Prange offers
The grips on my GS are a wonderful thing in the winter and no problem
in the summer Vibration BMWs dont vibrate Everyone knows that

Id agree with Henry  The grips are really nice to have in winter
and arent noticably different from normal grips in summer  

My only complaint is that the low setting might as well be off
This has been complained about by every reviewer official and
unofficial thats ever talked about these grips  The high setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy but since low doesnt produce a noticable
effect I end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right  This generally isnt a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves  When I asked the dealer if they could fix it I
received a consoling pat on the back and their sincere apologies for
the poor design actually I was told they worked just like they were
suppose to

Vibration  Whats that  I ride a BMW twin  You can barely tell if
the engine is fired up or not most of the time smoother than silk
sheets
