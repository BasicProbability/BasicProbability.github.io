CBDbut its nothing compared to the ahem unique helmet
CBDdesign seen in the new Animated Series it has a huge opening for his
CBDmouth topped by the worlds tiniest eyeslits above the enormous mouth
CBDopening Batmans helmet probably cuts you down to about 12 degrees of
CBDunrestricted vision With a helmet like this he might just be better
CBDoff with the leather capmask thingy

CBDCmon Batman doesnt need to SEE  Hes Batman

CBDDid you notice he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain

So lets see what we have on the Batdude so far He has a weird helmet
He drags his knee in corners thanks Cookson but how does he do it
Hidden Batpucks and he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain
Also he lets Robin ride I think I could have used a Batmom Would
have made getting my license a lot easier

Theres a trend here Stylish helmet Stylish kneedragging rides only
in Stylish cartoon precipitation Hmm    Could it be that were
dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur Dare I say it a
BATSQUID huh BatSquid It all adds up now   

Lets make the Bman an honorary DoD DuDe All he needs is a DoD
sticker

Actually anyone have an address for Batmans current artists both
comic book and animated series Well write and ask if Batman would like
to become an honorary Denizen Yeah

Special To The KoTL Is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary
member with an imaginary motorcycle Having seen the computers in the
BatCave I think we can safely assume that he also has imaginary
Internet access
