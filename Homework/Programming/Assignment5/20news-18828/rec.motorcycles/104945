Being a reletively new reader I am quite impressed with all the usefull
info available on this newsgroup  I would ask how to get my own DoD number

Hey cmon guys and gals I chose my words very carefully and even 
tried to get my FAQs straight  Dont holler BOHICA at me
 
Around here even mentioning the DoD without a number in your sig
can get you soundly FAQed  Notice however that I myself did
not FAQ the careful monk  He was after all waiting to press return
