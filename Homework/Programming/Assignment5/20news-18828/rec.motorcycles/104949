Subject Re Good Reasons to Wave at each other

jlevinerdhydroonca Jody Levine writes
Has anyone while driving a cage ever waved at bikers I get the urge
but Ive never actually done it

Oh yeah all the time  On a nice springsummer day I roll down the window
and drive around looking for bikes  When a bike motors by in the opposite
direction I stick my arm out and hi5em  My arm feels like a million 
bucks when Im doing this a 60kmh  I do the same thing with cyclists
The only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane
I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back  Oh well I 
think they appreciate the thought
