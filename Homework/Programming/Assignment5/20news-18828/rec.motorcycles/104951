if Im riding I would far sooner have the pillion hanging on to the bike
rather than me because I find that their weight can cause me to move
and that can upset the balance of the bike Most of the pillions I see 
over here hold the grabrail The really good ones dont hang on to anything
unless violent acceleration is taking place

Hmmmmndont you ride with your sweetheart

Only in my dreams
