  When did you go out and change the laws of physics   According to some
numbers I used to see bandied around shaft drive is on the order of 9597
efficient while chain drive is closer to 99   Seems to me that this makes
chain drive more efficient hmmmmm


Well maintained chains running in oil without those little rubber O rings 
to cause frictional losses might reach 99 efficiency  The average open to 
the dust O ring motorcycle chain probably has a difficult job making 90 
efficient
