bike  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel

I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions


Anybody who drove into somebody like that in this country would hopefully 
lose their licence  However the avoidance is simple  Dont stop behind the 
cage stop beside it or better still in front of it so that it acts as a 
buffer
