 final trajectory Too bad it didnt notice the car approaching at 50mph 
    
 from the other direction
 
 I got a closeup view of the our poor canine friends noggin careening off 
 the front bumper smacking the asphalt and getting runover by the front 
 tire It managed a pretty good yelp just before impact peripheral 
 imminent doom I guess the driver didnt see me or they probably would have 
 swerved into my lane The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
 home but I havent seen it since 
 

Same thing to me  Everyday the same dog would chase my bicycle
The owners thought it was cute  Even after I got the moto
the stupid dog would do the same thing  Then one day I was
coming home in the opposite lanethe fluff with teeth ran to
get me and played momentum sharing with a 73 Dodge pick
The owners tried to blame me for driving down street when I did
I lived in a wierd town
