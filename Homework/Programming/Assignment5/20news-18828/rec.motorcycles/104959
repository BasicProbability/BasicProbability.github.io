 Apparently that last post was a little hasy since I
 called around to more places and got quotes for less
 than 600 and 425  Liability only of course
 
 Plus one palced will give me C7C for my car  liab on the bike for
 only 1350 total which aint bad at all
 
 So I wont go with the first place I called thats
 fer sure
 

Nevertheless DWI is Fckin serious  Hope youve got some 
brains now
