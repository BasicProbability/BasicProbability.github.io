Subject Do Splitfires Help Spagthorpe Diesels

Earlier I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs  One
guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell  Well
I saw one think that someone said about Show me a team that used Split
fires  Well heres some additional insight and some theories
about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages

Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and
increased power for the 4x4 cages  Well for these guys splitfires

Now I dont know about all of this and Im trying to catch up with
somebody about it now but Splitfires should help twins more than

Splitfires work mainly by providing a moreorless unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber If an engines cylinder head design can benefit from this
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque Splitfires didnt do diddlysquat for my 1992 GMC
pickup 43l V6 but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friends 1986 Sportster 883 Folks I know whove
tried them in 1340 Evo motors cant tell any performance boost over plain
plugs which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape just different sizes Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead
Id dualplug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head
