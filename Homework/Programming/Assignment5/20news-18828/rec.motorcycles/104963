	Also is there a law or something that requires NYC to keep its
			 
street empty of potholes greater than a certain depth  I rather my bike 
 

HAHAHAHAHAAHAHHA WHAHwuhuhahuah

Thats a good one  Really stop  I cant breathe

	Bite your tongue Those of us who ACTUALLY RIDE in NYC on a
daily basis could not live without those Potholes Itll ruin the
flavor Its not enough just to dodge taxis buses pedistrians
bicycle messengers and BDIs on a block by block basis Those
potholes always makes for that sudden randomness that makes it all so
much fun Besides where else can you think of that allows you to
constantly test your panic braking shocks and dirtriding abilities
all on city streets You smooth asphalt canyon carvers dont know what
youre missing

I was laughing about the law part

Ive driven thru SOHOmanahattan I know what youre talking bout



Not that Durham NC is any better

well maybe a little bit anyway but the NC DOT takes more
money from road taxes and puts it in their own pockets and
into the pockets of the guys building the large condos that
need their own roads than they do back into fixing roads but
hey the local paper did a report of this last summer and 
boy am I glad I dont work for the DOT cause they got SHAT
on bigtimewonder who lost their jobs  ED  Got any idea
