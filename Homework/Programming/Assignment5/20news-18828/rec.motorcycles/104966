	Ok hold on a second and clarify something for me

	What does DWI stand for  I thought it was DUI for Driving Under
Influence so here what does W stand for 

	   JNM

Here in Iowa it ishas been OWI operating under the influence and OMVI
operating motor vehicle under the influence  They govt changed it to
OMVI so that people in motor boats could also be charged with drunk driving
