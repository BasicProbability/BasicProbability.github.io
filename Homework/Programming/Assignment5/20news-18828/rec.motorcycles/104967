 another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless  I am sitting
 at a light about 1  2 car lengths behind a car a wise decsion  Suddenly I 
 hear screeching tires  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize its the 
 moroon flying up right behind me in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
 bike  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel
 
 I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
 really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions
 
Another tip is to make sure you keep well to one side of the lane This gives
you a quicker escape route
