 hello there
 can anyone who has handson experience on riding the Yamaha vmax pls kindly
 comment on its handling 
 
 
    Some guy came to the OMRRA race school last weekend with number plates
    on his VMax  He didnt get more than 2 practice laps in before he pushed
    the frame too hard and it drove him into the guard rail on the back
    straight
 
    Portland International Raceway is now 2for2 on VMaxes
 
    VMax  handling  Ferget it
 
    BTW  The rider was conscious and semicoherent when the ambulance
    carted him off  Thats all I know

I hate to pick on someone who may have been seriously injured lets hope
not but semicoherent sounds like a good description of someone who
shows up at the track w a VMax in the first place
