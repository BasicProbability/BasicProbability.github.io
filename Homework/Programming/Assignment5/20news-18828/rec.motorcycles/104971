 Did anyone see the TV ad for the new BMW boxer on UK television
 at the weekend
 
 Not mesince I have no reception and no cable Im not likely to see
 any ads  And if I did theyd most likely be have been taped in the US
 anyway

Yeh Be tough to pick up UK Telly in your situation

No signs of Type 259 ads in TV in the states yet but I dont watch much
so Im not in a real position to comment

BUT I got my invite to the dealer introduction On the deck out back
RSVP is on the way
