I bought it I tried it
It is truly the miracle spooge
My chain is lubed my wheel is clean after 1000km

Id try it on the VFR but goddamn Competition Accessories hasnt mailed my
order yet  Hell its only been two weeks and I was ordering some pretty
bizzare stuff  Like a clear RF200 face sheild and a can of Chain Wax
Bastards

For what its worth I got my can in three days from Chaparral Thats
UPS ground from CA to UT YMMV The stuff seems to work and it doesnt
attract grundge like PJ1 Blue does I gave it the acid test a full
days worth of breaking in the Quadracers new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes If theres anything wet  stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day but the chain looked pretty clean

	Ill third the recommendation as Miracle Spooge

	Dont go to the dealer to get it or what happened to me might happen
to you  you put a deposit on a new bike

Sigh
