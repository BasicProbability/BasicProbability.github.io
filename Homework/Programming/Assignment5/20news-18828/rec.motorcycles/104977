   Which is better  a onepiece Aerostitch or a twopiece Aerostitch



Like most everyone else I ended up getting two different sizes for
the top and bottom  My top is a 46L and the bottom is a 48L  For the
bottom the waist is far too large but the thighs fit just right the
46 had a better waist but cut off the circulation in my legs I have
large muscular thighs and no I didnt use the thighmaster to get
them   The jacket fits me ok in the chest slightly snug at the
waist and too small in the arms  I cant imagine finding a onepiece
size that would have fit correctly as even the 2 piece has its
problems strange since my VPilot jacket fits great all over and
when I tried the matching pants they fit like a glove as well

I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are
in some way different from us real folks

Also even though its related to convienience you look pretty damn
wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands
Ive gotten some really suspicious looks and sweated a lot while in a
store wearing the whole suit since you cant fit the top and bottom
in any motorcycle storage device yet devised except the trunk in my
sidecar rig   With the two piece I unzip the pants I generally
leave the two pieces zipped together primarily because the pants fall
down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belttype band real tight
stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags the pants just fit
and run errands just wearing the jacket  Actually if I know Ill be
running errands I just wear my VPilot jacket but thats just me

As far as crash protection Id say that both suits are probably
equal  It seems that for weather protection if anything the 2 piece
provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by
3 inches  The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around
the waist just because of the extra layer of stuff but maybe not

So Id have to vote for the two piece  Despite the slightly odd fit
I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I
own  Wouldnt go long distance without it
