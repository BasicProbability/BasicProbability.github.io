Id try it on the VFR but goddamn Competition Accessories hasnt mailed my
order yet  Hell its only been two weeks and I was ordering some pretty
bizzare stuff  Like a clear RF200 face sheild and a can of Chain Wax
Bastards

For what its worth I got my can in three days from Chaparral Thats
UPS ground from CA to UT YMMV The stuff seems to work and it doesnt

I just called them and they said the order went out on the 13th  Theyre
putting a UPS tracer on it  Watch itll be waiting for me at home
