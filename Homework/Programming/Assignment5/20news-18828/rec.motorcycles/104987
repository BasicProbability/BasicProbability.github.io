  Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

	Yes but the rear wheel comes off the ground not the front
 See it just HOPS into the air  Figure

   I know the roads up there in Minnesota are pretty bad but I doubt that
they are THAT bad  Ive never realy tried to watch my back tyre but my 82
Maxim 750 will pull the front wheel off the ground if I pop the clutch
Admittedly it is easier with someone on back maybe thats what keeps the
rear tyre down
