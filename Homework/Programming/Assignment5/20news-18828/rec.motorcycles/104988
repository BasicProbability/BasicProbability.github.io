 Vmax racing horror story deleted

    VMax  handling  Ferget it

Actually a WERA racer William Lumsden considered running a Vmax in 
A Superstock  He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day and
really annoyed the 600 riders  they usually got caught behind a 
sideways Vmax in the corners and if they passed him going in hed
blow by down the straight usually wobbling  Needless to say since
he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F he decided against the Vmax

Too bad
