I cant help myself
Ive tried to be rational 
to look the other way
but everytime it happens 
its uncontrollable

I hate pre80s motorcycles

Hah  Newbie bait  Everyone knows the first motorcycle
wasnt built until 1893  there were no pre80s motorcycles

At first I thought it was a phase  I though I would
get used to them  It didnt happen  I tried gazing
at CB750s and 900 customs but each time I sadistically
pictured them being hurled off of large precipice
I also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and
taking holiday snaps but I cant figure that part out

Youve been watching too much Northern Exposure

What am I to do  Everytime I read a sig containing 
some spoked wheel wonder I shudder and feel pity that
the poor soul has suffered enough

Why  Because our wheels are repairable

 I imagine the owner
scrapping out his or her living in a discarded Maytag
refridgerator box tucked in next to their CX500

Humph  Obviously more bait  Everyone knows you dont discard
Maytag boxes  Even after theyve become uninhabitable theyre
make a great poor boys mechanics creeper

CX500  Whazzat

Im hoping for some deliverance

Okay  Lets hear you squeal like a pig

 I had in the past loathed
the Milwaukee machine but I can actually begin to understand
some of the preaching  There must be hope 

Beware fanatical preaching lest the residents of Waco Texas set up
a huge salad bar in your honor
