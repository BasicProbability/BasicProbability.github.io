OK MOAers You read it think for yourself I trust you do know who
Cecil King is and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass and he is
a pres candidate  I let you draw your own conclusions

I dont know who either is but I think I see your problem

Youve got Cecil King and Don Douglass  What you need is Don King
and Cecil Adams


Or maybe Rodney King and Beanie  Cecil
