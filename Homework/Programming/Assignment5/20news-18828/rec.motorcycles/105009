Subject Re Need advice for riding with someone on pillion


One of the reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was
becase he had a BMW 

Sigh   Thats music to my ears after all the complaining Lois did
about the seat on my BMW

The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive  Echo the movements
and lean of your rider  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable
but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn

Ive found that the phrase sack of potatoes works pretty well in
describing to a passenger how she should act

Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders but be 
sure and squeeze your thighs while youre doing it so your rider knows youre
still there   The guard rail isnt as safe as holding onto your rider

On a long ride with my exgirlfriend Nancy I would notice her
drifting off every so often we were droning down highway 101 to LA
I probably wouldnt have been aware of this if she hadnt been in the
habit of squeezing my butt with her knees to hold on   Good advice
