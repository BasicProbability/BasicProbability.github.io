 If this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve I have
 the same question  Do you buy a FULL set of shims before starting the
 adjustment process or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
 off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock 
 Obviously the latter would be cheaper what do shims cost but are
 measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims

Only buy what you need  It would cost a lot to buy a full set and
you wont ever use most of them  I have had good luck with the
calculation method  I have never had to change more than one size
increment at a time I never needed a change larger than the next
size updown usually down  They cost a few  each for a Yamaha
