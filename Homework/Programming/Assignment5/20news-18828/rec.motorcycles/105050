 Various posts about shafties cant do wheelies
 
   No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
   of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
   off the ground
 
 Good point Johna buddy of mine told me that same thing when I had my
 BMW R80GS I dumped the clutch at 5000rpm hey ito nly revved to 7 or so and
 you know what He was right
 
 Uh folks the shaft doesnt have diddleysquatpoop to do with it I can get
 the front wheel off the ground on my 5 ferchrissake
 
you may have been able to bounce the front up but not
actually do a wheelie see the shaft effect unloads
the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front
this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts
scraping in a corner

	Sorry to be contradictory but Ive had my Nighthawk at 45 degress
with the horizon and I wasnt banked over in a turn  
	The hard part is getting the front in off the ground  I rev to about 
7000 at DROP the clutch   Even harder is keeping it from coming up to far
I use the back brake as well as the throttle  Once its up itll wheelie just
like any other bike
