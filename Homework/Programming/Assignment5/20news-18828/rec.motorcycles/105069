So how do I steer when my hands arent on the bars Open Budweiser in left 
hand Camel cigarette in the right no feet allowed 

If I lean and the 
bike turns am I countersteering

No the bars would turn only toward the direction of turn in
nohands steering

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer
Ill supply one

Yes even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering  Basically to turn left you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle
than a bicycle though because of the extra weight  Ok so my
motorcycle is heavy  Maybe yous isnt
