 I need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 Ninja
 This will be the the first time Ive taken anyone for an extended ride
 read farther than around the block    Well be riding some twisty 
 fairly bumpy roads the Mines RoadMtHamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans
 
 This person is 100 lbs and fairly small so I dont see weight as too much
 of a problem but what sort of of advice should I give her before we go

My fiancee and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2up  Ill tell you 
what weve found and the systems weve worked out

 On starts accelerate MUCH slower than usual  Its tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is because were holding onto something
and leaning forward  Remember this

 On turns have her lean forward and at the same angle as you normally 
this means she isnt leaning at all  Its very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that theyre sitting straight up
Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous

 On slowing and stopping do so MUCH slower than usual  Again its tough 
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is because were holding 
onto something and leaning forward  However youll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you which 
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location

 Generally have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike not 
out wide  This helps balance and gives her somegrip

 When you passenger is in fear she will squeeze her knees against you
Normally this means slow down and do it now  


 turning so she leans with me but what else  Are there traditional
 signals for SLOW DOWN or GO FASTER or I HAFTA GO PEE etc

We only have a couple signals  Slow down is her either tapping me on 
the back or slapping my helmet with all her might  Depends on the urgency
of the matter 

Turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit  This is
also the sign for cool  Look at that  I hafta pee is the same sign
as turn here  Im hungry is the same sign  Go faster is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee  I usually see slow
down more often than go faster
 
 I really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that
 shell want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated

The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy and 
pillion on his or her bike  Its incredibly frustrating because youre 
in almost no control  Now multiply that feeling times ten because
you as a rider know what your bike will do and your passenger will likely
feel youre about to scrape hard parts all the time or lock up the brakes
at any moment or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain etc  
Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad

Also remember that its much more draining and tiring to ride 2up
than by yourself because youre concentrating on much more and
in the Zen of the moment less  Remember this
