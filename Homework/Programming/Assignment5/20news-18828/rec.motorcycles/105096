Subject Re Dogs vs Bikes

Dogs will chase anything that moves I have two dogs and they love
chasing me when I ride off They will also chase any car that passes
 running along the footpathsidewalk at up to 60kph They dont
seem to go after trucks though the size difference must be a factor

It also works in my favour though I can exercise them quite easily
by riding 12 mile up the road and back a few times
