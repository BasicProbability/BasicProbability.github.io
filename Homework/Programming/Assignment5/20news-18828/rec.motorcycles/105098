But as he drove past me he actually turned all the way around in his
car seat to see if I had noticed  I nodded to him and smiled
I cant for the life of me figure out why he was so friendly

Its the DoD license plate frame cops really like em  Either that or
he mistook you for one of his friends possibly an offduty cop
