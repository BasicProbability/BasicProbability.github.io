Old Nick the little devil wibbles

 Tsk tsk tsk  Another newbie bites the dust eh  Theyll learn

   Newbie  Eh  Slap yer credentials  on the table Pete  Thatll  show
   him


 Im terribly sorry

   And so you damned well should  be  young whippersnapper  Its  wet
   kippers at ten paces if theres any repeat of this sort of thing

   Now in keeping with the  grand tradition of wreckmoto lets  mutate
   Take your partners by the hand

   On Tuesday morning I spent a couple of hours when I should have been
   working with a  torch brazing bits  of scrap metal  over the  biggest
   holes in  Yamadogs exhaust  pipes smazin  what you  can do  with  a
   couple of AA  cells and a  threevolt bulb   I stuck some  gungum
   into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike

   So last night  Im on the  way home  when lo an  bloody behold  the
   sodding thing starts  blowing again   I check  it out and  the gas  is
   escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the
   port  As far as I can see it being somewhat hole of Calcutta at the
   time the nuts are still there  stop that bloody sniggering you  at
   the back but the pipe is a bit loose

   This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socketset  to
   tighten up me nuts somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good
   slap  round  the  back  of  the  head  and  lo  an  bloody  behold
   abloodygen I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from
   the inner sleeve right at the clampmating bevel  So I stuff in a bit
   of bakedbeanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts very best gungum  and
   come to work late again so that I  can ask of the oracle  Will  a
   brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port  Anybody tried it

   Oh and if anybody can tell me  what the differences are between a  205
   and a  207  brazing  rod made  by  Gaz  Yup   the  camping  folks
   Surprised the marmalade outa me too in that place just off the Isle
   of Wight Id be eternally  grateful twentysoddingquid for two  rods
   and I dont even know what Im buying  Bloody kanji
