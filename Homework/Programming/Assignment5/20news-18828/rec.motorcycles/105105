 Honda  a V designates a V engine street bike VF for V4 VT for Vtwin
 
 So how about my Honda Hawk NT 650 Its a twin but not called a VT
  

  Thats because they took the old VT 500 engine and stepped on it to make
  the plant for the Hawk  New Twin  Or does that only fly for Microsoft
  NT New Technology

  Ive been at this too long today
