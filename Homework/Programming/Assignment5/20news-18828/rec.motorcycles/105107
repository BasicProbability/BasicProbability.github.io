Subject Power Loss under load of a Honda CB360T

I have a 1974 Honda CB360T which for most of my purposes runs well 
However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load 
That is on a mild upgrade  50 mph in 4th or 5th Im lucky if I can
hold speed  If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm power drops
drastically  Put simply under load the engine wont rev past 5000
rpm  The top thirdhalf of the throttle range is dead  Standing still
the engine runs fine up to red line 910K

Other phenomenology at about the point that power loss kicks in the
engine becomes a little wavery  That is at a steady throttle the
engine speed goes up and down slightly  The bike has about 13000 miles
on it and is in good tune at least until it starts to balk

I would appreciate any suggestions as to whats ailing the poor beast 
My thoughts run toward clogged jets andor improper spark advance  Im
hoping its not something more drastic since the bikes not really worth
the hassle of any major engine work

                                        Thanks
