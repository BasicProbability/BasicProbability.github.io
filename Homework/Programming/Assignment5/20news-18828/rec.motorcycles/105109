I was just wondering if there were any law officers that read this  I have
several questions I would like to ask pertaining to motorcycles and cops
And please dont say get a vehicle code go to your local station or obvious
things like that  My questions would not be found in those places nor
answered face to face with a real live in the flesh cop
If your brother had a friend who had a cousin whos father was a cop etc
dont bother writing in  Thanks
