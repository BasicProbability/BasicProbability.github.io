 You cant make a Citizens arrest on anything but a felony

	Im not sure thats true  Let me rephrase You can file a complaint
 which will bring the person into court  As I understand it a
 citizens arrest does not have to be the physical detention of
 the person
 I think we just found the difference between a citizens arrest physical 
 detention of a suspect and a reportwarrant


 Better now
