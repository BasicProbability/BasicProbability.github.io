 Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 
 
 You better check all the screws in that carb before you suck
 one into a jug and munge a piston or valve Ive seen it
 happen before
 
 WHAT On a MIKUNI Im going through the exploded view of the
 40mm flatslide on the Ol Sport the 36mm round slide on Spike and
 the monster on my old Norton in my mind and I cant for the life of
 me see a screw in any of them that if it came loose could get into a
 jug 

When they explode em all the screws fly away
