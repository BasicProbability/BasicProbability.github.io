I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

If possible I split lanes Even if you dont get all the way to the
head of the line at least you wont rearended I always worry more when
Im in the lane at the front of the line and no one in behind me Then you
have to keep an eye on your mirrors I also get ready to pull a hard right
just in case
