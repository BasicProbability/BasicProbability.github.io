Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
2 position switch but sure enough as Deam expected  when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on

This provides a very nice light coverage of the
road


Hmmmm I noticed sometime ago that I could do the same on my Virago and
since I dont read many schematics I didnt really think aobut it too
much   Yes it does provide excellent coverage but I figured it would
probably draw a little too much current  I also figured that it was 
overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight  Are you saying 
that these switches are designed for the hilo combination
