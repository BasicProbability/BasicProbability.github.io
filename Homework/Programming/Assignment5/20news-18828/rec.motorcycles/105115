Yep it works like a charm I had the same problem after about 78 years
of constant use and I was thinking of seeing how much Eclipse would
want to install a new zipper But someone I think it was Chuck Karish
suggested I try that trick It took a couple of tries to get the right
amount of squish but its been fine for about 3 years since I squished
it It should work for any of the nyloncoil type zippers

OTOH
I tried this on my HG Concord jacket Thursday night  Really I just
made a tinyadjustment type of squeeze  Really

Is was   your HG zipper the nyloncoil type or the kind with
molded plastic teeth Ive only tried it on the coiled nylon type and
it doesnt take much squish to fix the problem I found I was overdoing
it no broken parts but the zipper was too hard to pull so after
spreading the zipper pull jaws again I tried with ViceGrips No not
the usual Grip Of Death technique I adjusted the closed ViceGrips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit A couple of iterations and I had just the right
amount of Zipper Squish TM

Result I now know that noplace in Spokane will even consider trying
to repair a broken zippercloserthingy which must be a 030 part
which needs a 20 tool to install

Ive had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit actually on the
Accessory Ellipse and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
charge I dont know what brand of zippers HG uses but parts ARE
available for YKKs plastic zippers Replacement was pretty simple just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end Slide on the new zipper pull Then
crimp on ViceGrips again a replacement zipper stop

You might try fabric stores  such and see if they sell replacement
parts

Oh for what its worth the coiltype zippers on the Eclipse tankbag
are also YKK
