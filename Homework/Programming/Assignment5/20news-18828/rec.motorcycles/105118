I am looking for a new tank bag now and I wondered if you as follow 
FJ11001200 owners could make some suggestions as to what has and has
not worked for you 
With the FJs large flat gas tank Id imagine that almost anything
would work Personally Im quite happy with my Eclipse standard tank
bag

Me too Even after I bought the 3piece Krauser K2 set  Now and then 
DK puts them on sale for 50 bux or so to clear out inventory but they
never seem to to go away  They are the Volkswagens of tank bags I guess

BTW the late Paul O Neill showed me a trick with a pair of pliers that
will extend their life considerably  When the zipper starts to separate
behind the pull because of age and wear squash the pull body with the
pliers just a bit to tighten it back up  I would have tossed my bag three 
years ago but this fixed it up and kept it secure and reliable
