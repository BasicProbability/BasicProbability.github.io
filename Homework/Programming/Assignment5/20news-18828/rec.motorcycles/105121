  description of a pretty rowdysounding party
 
 And still we wonder why they stereotype us
 
 Erc
 
  Whacha mean weifin they whom ever they are want to stereotype me
 as one that likes to drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their
 beautiful bodies  I like that stereotype
   If you were refering stereotype to infer a negative  you noticed we
 didnt rape pillage or burn down the town We also left mucho bucks as in
 MONEY with the town Me thinks the town LIKES us Least they said so

 They bein themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population
 bein the ones that regard bikers as a loud irresponsible irreverent
 reprobate rabble  

Doesnt sound like they attended though does it  In fact if we riders
need friends it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
Lynns description especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year

 Sure you didnt rape and pillage Its a relief to know that you were
 such gentlemen but because you were not completely outofhand you 
 justify your lesser indescretions  Some pretty distorted thinking I
 should say  

You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these lesser
indiscretions  If the townspeople arent ruffled by the
indiscretions and the partyers arent either maybe the indiscretions
dont amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
goodnatured rowdiness among consenting adults  The only thing that 
really bothered me about the description was the kneedeep empty beer cans 
in the street but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
helped set up the party in the first place  If I lived there and the
bikers previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions Id certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed

 Oh Im sorry I just noticed that you left mucho bucks as in MONEY
 Nevermind my criticism I was out of line  I forgot that when one leaves
 mucho bucks as in MONEY their behavior is permissable perhaps even 
 justified

If it doesnt hurt anyone and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless then who 
needs to permit or justify it  You  Why do you need to do that

 Keep in mind that themfolks are the ones that could give a  when 
 a biker gets killed when their elected officials institute further
 draconian legislation helmet laws gun controls etc the ones that dont 
 respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all the
 rest of the time

Ironically these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
dont happen to fit the stereotype you describe  Theyve developed a
friendly longterm mutuallybeneficial relationship with a group of 
motorcyclists and arent as burdened with MCignorance as is the general
population because of it

 Need I continue

If such a need exists it surely must come from within

 So continue to wear your stigma as a badge but the next time you are
 whining about them and the effect of their values on yours remember
 that it was probably the behavior of selfrighteous wusses like myself
 that kept them at bay for this long

Well you got the selfrighteous wusses part right anyway

You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
 We aint too pretty we aint too proud
 We might be laughin a bit too loud
 Ah but that never hurt no one       
 You know that only the good die young
