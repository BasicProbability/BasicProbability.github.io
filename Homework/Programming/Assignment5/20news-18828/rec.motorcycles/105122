  Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive
  
  No Mike  It is imposible due to the shaft effect  The centripital effects
  of the rotating shaft counteract any tendency for the front wheel to lift
  off the ground

 Well my last two motorcycles have been shaft driven and they will wheelie
 The rear gear does climb the ring gear and lift the rear which gives an
 odd feel but it still wheelies

Feeding frenzy

Ah tis April in recmoto and the newbies are bitin  Catch all you want
well make more
