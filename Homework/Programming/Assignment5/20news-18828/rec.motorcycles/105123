Can anyone recommend a good place for reasonably priced bike paint jobs
preferably but not essentially in the London area 

Try Dream Machine 0602 736615 Ive seen a few examples of their
work and it looks pretty good Theyre in the midlands though


Dream machine quality aint what it used to be

Kinetic Art did some great paint jobs on Bimotas Dont know if they are still
around
