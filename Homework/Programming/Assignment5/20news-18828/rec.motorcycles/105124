Is there a way to wax out a dull finish minor scrathes  While
passngering on my fiances Bandit my hippack rubbed against the tail
and left a nasty dull finish and teeny scratches Is there a way to get
rid of these  Buff them out  Wax them out
help


Car accessory shops here sell stuff called TCut which is a very fine
cutting paste for paint and this will remove the dull finish and
minor acratches It will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that
you probably dont realise is there and give your paintwork its original
lustre and shine It can sometimes react badly with metallic paint though
so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff Afterwards
apply wax polish and all will be well again

BTW  dont confuse Tcut with the cutting paste used for grinding in 
valvesthe principles the same but the coarseness is vastly different
