Hello netreaders  I am looking for a little netadvice

Ive got my eye on a 92 Suzuki GS500E at a local dealer The bikes got
3200 miles on it and looks in mint condition  Dealer is asking a bit
less than 2800 Good price  I dont have access to a blue book and am
too lazy to go to the library  Dealer is letting me testride it
this week

Blue Book says Wholesale2115 Retail2895
Sounds like you are getting a pretty fair price assuming it is in
nice condition
