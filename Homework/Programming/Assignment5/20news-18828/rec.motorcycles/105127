A few of us are touring Sothwest Utah in mid June to see the Canyons
Do any of you have some helpful hints on where to stay or
things to seedoavoid  Plans are to see Bryce Zion Arches
Is the Grand close at that point or is an additional trip required

Well its closer to Bryce than Bryce is to Arches Id spend a lot
of time studying the maps theres a lot of you cant get there from
here in that area You might want to hit the Grand Canyon on the way
up from California loop around to CanyonlandsMoabArches and then
back down towards Bryce  Zion on the way home

Make sure you ride US 12 between Capitol Reef and Bryce its been on a
number of top 10 roads lists

Highway 12 is a great road  Be sure to stop by the Anasazi sp village
museum near Boulder Creek  Interesting lifestyle   The views of Dixie 
National Forest are stunning
