Subject FORSALE  1982 Yamaha Seca 650 Turbo

I dont want to do this but I need money for school  This is
a very snappy bike  It needs a little work and I dont have the
money for it  Some details

	19000 miles
	Mitsubishi turbo
	not asthetically beautiful but very fast
	One of the few factory turboed bikes not a kit
	Must see and ride to appreciate how fun this bike is

I am asking 700 or best offer  The bike can be seen in
Bennington Vermont  Email for more info

Thanks
Chris
