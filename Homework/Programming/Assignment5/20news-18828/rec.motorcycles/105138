the brake pedal c c Ive pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oilfilter
for me  Compared to the 5minute change he was used to for his Honda this
is just a design flawoversight in my eyes

Sure dont know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasnt a
Virago  Ive owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter
change in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed  

Well watching several Denizens dismantle Lauries Virago in an
attempt to change the oil at the ride n feed a few years back was a
pretty funny site  Surely with the combined wisdom of all these folks
they werent doing things the hard way were they
