hear screeching tires  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize its the 
moroon flying up right behind me in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
bike  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel
I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident  Suggestions

The experience you describe is why I dont like to sit with my bike in
gear  I figure theres a chance that Ill be startled in some way and
stall my bike  And I figure this is more likely than the chance that
Ill be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
needed to put the bike in gear

So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making splitsecond
evasive manuvers  I split lanes so Im not at the end of the line
Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country  If I cant
split perhaps there isnt room then I will stop near one side of the
lane so I have an easy escape and leave my bike in gear until the next
car has stopped  I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
it will  Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to
stop I havent had to find out yet  Some cars have an annoying habbit
of racing up behind you before braking heavilly so it can be hard to
tell if they are planning to brake or not

So in summary position yourself for an easy exit and then watch your
mirrors until its all clear
