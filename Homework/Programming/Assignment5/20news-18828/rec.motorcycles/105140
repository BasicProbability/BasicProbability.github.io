NH 1 Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T Are 
NHthere any easy ways to do this ie a slipin bulb replacement

No  The Honda 360s employed a sealed beam which was not interchangeable
with anything else so far as I could ever tell  Ive owned two 360s
over the years and that was always one of my biggest nits

	Im not sure how far standardisation went but on two of my bikes the
GS550B and I think the GT380M I was able to pop a Cibie insert directly
into the original housing held in by those roughly Wshaped springs  The
inserts used 5560W halogen bulbs and were great although Mr Bill later
indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system
