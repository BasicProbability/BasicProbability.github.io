    I am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle and to
put it bluntly it sucks  I really would like some advice on what would
be a good starter bike for me  I do know one thing however I need to
make my first bike a good one because buying a second any time soon is
out of the question  I am specifically interested in racing bikes CBR
600 F2 GSXR 750  I know that this may sound kind of crazy
considering that Ive never had a bike before but I am responsible a
fast learner and in love  

Responsible and in love  I believe thats a contradiction
in terms

Unless youre really brave read reckless a 500cc sport
bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
year of riding  Getting more than that really is overkill
as youll never even want to use it  The following bikes
can be bought and repaired cheaply are easy for a novice
to manage and are plenty high performance
    Kawasaki EX500
    Honda VF500 Interceptor
    Suzuki GS550E

The 0100mph time of the EX500 at full throttle is way
sooner than youre ready for it    With something
as small as a 250 youd probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly unless its a TZR or RGV 

Now Im not saying that youre 100 certain to kill
yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR750  Plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine  What I am saying is that its a waste of
money and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping
Youll never get the throttle more than half open
anyway so why spend the extra 2000 bucks
