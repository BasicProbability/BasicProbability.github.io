Course the only people who seem to be acting smug now probably have chain
final drive which as we all know is less efficient and has higher
maintenance and probably didnt know the answer at the start of the thread

  When did you go out and change the laws of physics   According to some
numbers I used to see bandied around shaft drive is on the order of 9597
efficient while chain drive is closer to 99   Seems to me that this makes
chain drive more efficient hmmmmm

  And granted shaft has a lot less maintenance which is fine if you dont
mind less performance

OK  And you regularly ride your bike to within 2 of its maximum capability
Note any idiot can go flat out on a bike  most of them do

Anyway efficient at what  A shaft drive is a much more efficient solid erect lump
of metal than a floppy flaccid unsatisfying chain
