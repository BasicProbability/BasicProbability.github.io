Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

Mike Terry

Ive seen em but the real question is can one do a wheelie on a Lead Wing
If so how high would the front wheel be off the ground

 Wheelies on Lead Wings are possible but they aint easy or so my
hhmmm what is the relation great uncle several times removed tells
me  As for how high how high do you want em  Modulation isnt
exactly the easiest thing in the world or so says a guy 57 years old

Well apparently once you get past about 6 inches all the luggage shifts back in the panniers the passenger slides back and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack
and they go all the way over until its flat on its ass with the front wheel
straight up in the sky  Impressive but hard on the tail lights
