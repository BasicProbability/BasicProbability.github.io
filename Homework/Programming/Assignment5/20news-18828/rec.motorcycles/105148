 Lotus looks set for a management buyout GM werent happy that the Elan was 
 late and too pricey  If they can write off the Elan development costs the may 
 be able to sell them for a sensible price

I read that GM wants to keep the Design part of Lotus but lose the car
production And I seem to remember that the main problem with the Elan
was caused by GMs insistence that the Elan be redesigned significantly
for the US market which caused major design  production headaches 

   I think there is a legal clause in the RR name regardless of who owns it
   it must be a British companyowner  ie BA can sell the company but not
   the name

  I dont believe that BA have anything to do with RR  Its a seperate
  company from the RR AeroEngine company 
 
 Its Vickers who own Rolls Royce cars 

Quite true  brain fade on my part
