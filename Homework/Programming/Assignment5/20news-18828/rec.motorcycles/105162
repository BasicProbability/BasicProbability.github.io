	Interesting  All I can say is that I havent seen any wear in the
1000 miles Ive used the stuff on the Ninja and the bike stays soooo clean


On a related note since UPS lost my Chain Wax and Im still using PJ1Goo
I found some great stuff to clean chain spooge of wheels  Its called
Goo Gone and cleaned the spooge off my rear wheel faster than the Simple
Green cleaned the bug guts off my headlight  Wonderful stuff  I recommend
that we officially delcare it a DoD Wonder Spooge tm product
