I found some great stuff to clean chain spooge of wheels  Its called
Goo Gone and cleaned the spooge off my rear wheel faster than the Simple
Green cleaned the bug guts off my headlight  Wonderful stuff  I recommend
that we officially delcare it a DoD Wonder Spooge tm product

I think you can get that at most head shops  Im not kidding although
it seems more appropriate for them to be selling Simple Green
