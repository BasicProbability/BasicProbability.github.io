ed1  All of us that argue about gyroscopes etc throughly understand
edthe technique of countersteering

meIncluding all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way
methrough a corner

edWell all the way through a decreasingradius corner anyway

Maybe they are riding around an everdecreasing circle of lies which
eventually leads to the truth



meThe official line here though I do have my doubts about it is that the
mefront brake is applied first followed by the rear brake the idea being
methat you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place 

If thats the official line taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to that also dont teach countersteering I have to
question the quality of the classes 

Me too though unfortunately the Official Line is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence The examiners
guidelines are laid down by the government and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them It surprises me that none of the
rider groups here either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass that the front brake must be applied before the rear that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time instead of just
when it is justified  theres probably a few more too which I cant
think of for the moment If the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
to include more of the realworld survival skills and less of the 
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now then the accident figures
would imho reduce still further

Dont think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though
