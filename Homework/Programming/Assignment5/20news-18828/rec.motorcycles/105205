 I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment
of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson  yes he has not left the 
country yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR750 
shows that  the light switch is a three position switch 

My CB750 does it too  The Switch Continuity section of the wiring diagram
looks something like this

	HL L  H
        xx     Low
        xxx  N
        xx  High

And my 78 CX500 too  I first thought it was the wiring diagram that didnt
fit MY machine
