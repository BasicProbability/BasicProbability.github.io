Subject Re Posted Gif of BMW R100S

 	If any would care to see any more closeups or different angles I can
 	post others to abp also I would be happy to submit one to cerritos
 	if someone wants to write me and tell me how

I would prefer a picture with you in it  Since most motorcycles dont post
and are rather similar looking ie all R100Ss are more alike than they are
different it is the people that are ultimately more interesting
