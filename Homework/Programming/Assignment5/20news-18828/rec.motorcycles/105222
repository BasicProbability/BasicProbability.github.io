I am in hte market for a new bike been without for a few years
The two main bikes Im looking at seriously are
The Yamaha Virago 535 and the Honda Shadow VLX 583 
I am leaning towards the Yamaha for its shaft drive the Honda is Chain
Insurance in Fla is more costly than I thought so I am staying in this
power range Thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences

A friend of mine whos probably reading this right now just bought a new
Yamaha Virago 750  After spending 12 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts had to remove the right peg loosen
the brake pedal c c Ive pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oilfilter
for me  Compared to the 5minute change he was used to for his Honda this
is just a design flawoversight in my eyes
