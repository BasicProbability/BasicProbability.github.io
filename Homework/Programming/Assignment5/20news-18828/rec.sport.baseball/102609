Subject Re ESPN and Expansion

I was watching Peter Gammons on ESPN last night and hes got me a little
confused

While talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit
from the fringe players theyll be facing McGriff hitting 50 home runs
Sheffield getting 150 rbis and Glavine winning 25 games  This was
of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball
has expanded early 60s late 60s late 70s

What really confused me though was the mention of AL players who would
do well next year  Specifically Roger Clemens winning 25 games and the
likes of McGwire and Gonzalez hitting 50 home runs

My question is  How in the hell will the RockiesMarlins help the AL  The
last time I looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues  Did I
miss something

I wondered the same thing  When he first mentioned it I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over  And then in the
examples from other years he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded

So since stats NEVER lie   I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that normally they would not have had there not been expansion

Make sense
