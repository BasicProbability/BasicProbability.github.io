Subject Opening Day of 1990

The Os just lost to the Rangers a few minutes ago I was not too happy about
the pitching of Rick Sutcliffe 6 runs in 6 innings 5 in the 3 This puts
me in remembering the 1990 Os season After 89 we didnt do much over
winter and we wound up in 5th Now I know that Mussina McDonald and Rhodes
are better pitching prospects than Ballard and Milacki but are any other
Oriole fans scared out there

PS Other scores as of now
Cincy over Montreal 21 I think
FLORIDA IS LEADING LA 63 IN THE 8TH
Braves vs Cubs 10 in the 8th Futility of Cubs batting haunting them
Yanks beat the Tribe I believe
