Since I havent been able to keep up with baseball much this season I
have a few questions about my favorite team the Minnesota Twins

1  How good does their rotation look  The last I heard the order is
Tapani Erikson Mahomes Banks and some guy Ive never heard of 
sounds pretty pathetic to me

Well maybe it will be  Banks is a 24 yearold prospect who hasnt 
matured as quickly as they would have liked  Mahomes is a 22 yearold 
who is very highly touted  Tapani and Erickson are also young and 
have looked very good this spring  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies formerly of Houston and SD and Mike Trombley  Deshaies 
hasnt looked very good this spring so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley although they hadnt wanted 3 starters this unproven 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley


2  Who is playing short and third

Well Scott Leius is the shortstop  He played mostly 3B last year but 
was a SS in the minors and moved back after Gagne left to KC  3B is 
split maybe between Pagliarulo who has had a great spring and Terry 
Jorgenson a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 
years  Im not sure how the time will be divided but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here  I like Jorgenson but I fear they 
might give too much time to Pags
 
3  Hows Winfield doing

Sorry cant help you here

Dennis
