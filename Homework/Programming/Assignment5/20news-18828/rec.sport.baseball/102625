jayson stark i trhink thats him fits perfectly in this category

anyone who writes dean palmer has 2 homers   at this pace hell
 have 324 home runs should be shot

Bob I think that Stark does this sort of thing as a joke not as a
serious prediction  I dont really see why we should shoot him for
that  The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming
how great the Royals chances are in the AL West since all evidence
indicates that they arent joking and actually believe it
