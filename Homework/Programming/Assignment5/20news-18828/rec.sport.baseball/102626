  That brings up an interesting point Anyone else catch ESPNs piece about
prospects and the relationship between age career length MVPs and Hall of
Fame members It was part of their preseason special 

Wow  ESPN can repeat elevenyearold Bill James research  Literally
Check the 1982 Abstract  

  It was the most impressive thing Ive seen on ESPN in recent memory 

Perhaps in 2004 theyll be as reliable as an average SDCN

  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight 

Oops maybe not
