Personally I think that Alomar is all hype He is producing incredibly now
but in the long run he will never put up the numbers that Sandberg has For
THIS moment Alomar may be the best but overall Sandberg wins out by a long
shot

When Sandberg was Alomars age he was putting up 261 seasons with no power
Alomars 1992 OBA is 25 points higher than Sandbergs career high  Alomars
career high in doubles and triples is higher than Sandbergs  Sandberg is
still better than Alomar but only because Alomar hasnt reached his full
potential yet  Alomars got a 25 yearheadstart on Sandberg he has 862
hits Sandberg didnt have 862 hits until he was 26 and is likely to
put up better career numbers than Sandberg in everything except home runs
Hell pass Sandberg in stolen bases sometime in 1995

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases  What competition did 
Alomar have  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken and the same year as Boggs
Gwynn and the other magicians  So less attention was given to Sandberg 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre  Besides the 
numbers dont count  National league pitchers are much better pitchers
