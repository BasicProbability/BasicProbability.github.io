Will Clark
Matt Williams
Robbie Thompson
Rod BeckAll came up through the Giants system

Geez  Everyone comes up with Clark Williams Thompson  These guys
were all up in 1987  Thats ancient history  So in the last 6 years
noone right  Beck doesnt count  I said 2 solid years

BTW Manwaring lead the ML last season in throwing out baserunners He is
an excellent defensive catcher I agree that his offensive skills are
limited but he does seem to be improving on them

Lets see what he does wo the help of a pitchout every other pitch
As I remember even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under
Roger Craig who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown
out  Of course he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too
I am not a big fan of Manwaring
