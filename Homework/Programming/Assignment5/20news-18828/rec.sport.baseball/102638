briefly since im off to sleep

mles work pretty well for AA nd AAA players

players who are 22 and younger will tend to have explosions
 in their numbers whether mMLEs or not in the next 2 years

players who are 26 and OLDER at those levels generally have
 inflated MLEs

theyre about as reliable as having major league stats for a player
