Subject Re Best Second Baseman

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases  What competition did 
Alomar have  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken and the same year as Boggs
Gwynn and the other magicians  So less attention was given to Sandberg 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre  Besides the 
numbers dont count  National league pitchers are much better pitchers 

Youre right Thomas Gonzalez Sheffield and Griffey dont even begin
to compare with Ripken Boggs and Gwynn so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible  So was his sophomore year

National League pitchers are much better pitchers  That certainly explains
Sheffields 1993 hm  Are you confusing have ERAs that are 040 lower
because they dont face DHs with much better
