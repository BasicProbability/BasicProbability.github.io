Subject Re ESPN and Expansion

I was watching Peter Gammons on ESPN last night and hes got me a little
confused

While talking about expansion he started mentioning people who might benefit
from the fringe players theyll be facing McGriff hitting 50 home runs
Sheffield getting 150 rbis and Glavine winning 25 games  This was
of course all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball
has expanded early 60s late 60s late 70s

What really confused me though was the mention of AL players who would
do well next year  Specifically Roger Clemens winning 25 games and the
likes of McGwire and Gonzalez hitting 50 home runs

My question is  How in the hell will the RockiesMarlins help the AL  The
last time I looked there wasnt a lot of talent jumping leagues  Did I
miss something

Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about
baseball than the average mailbox  Okay Im overstating  Still the man 
actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this
year did not pitch in the majors last year

Huh

IMO this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the 
other expansion drafts had since the talent was diluted over both leagues
In Gammons defense because the talent drain came from the AL as well some
increase will be seen  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump
in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season  Hes still
full of it
