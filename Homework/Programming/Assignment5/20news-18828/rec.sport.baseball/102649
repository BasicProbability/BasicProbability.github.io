ive said the braves would improve by injury as well  heres how

javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson
ryan klasko is a better firstbaseman than bream
 chipper jones is a better shortstop than anyone the braves
 put out there

mel nieves is better than nixonsanders

thats how it FORCES them to play the young guys

 I continue to be amazed at these comments  While Lopez might some
 day be a better catcher than Olson I find it totally amazing for
 you to suggest that this 22 yearold with three seasons of professional
 baseball is now better than Olson a fiveyear MLB veteran who is
 noted for his ability to call a game and who has a betterthanaverage
 arm  Oh perhaps you are talking about hitting  Well sure Lopez
 might hit better  Perhaps he probably will
 
 But has there ever in the history of baseball been a 22yearold or
 younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
 catchers in terms of defense and brought a 247 bat  Wasnt it 

Yes Ivan Rodriguez last year  Batted 260 and threw out 51 of the
baserunners  Not too shabby for a rookie from AA  20 years old last
year

 Sandy Alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year
 Not  Wasnt it Benito Santiago who was supposed to be that good
 in his rookie year  Not
 
 I can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get
 the point  You and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the 
 seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies  Perhaps 
 just perhaps  the management team of the pennantwinning Braves
 knows something more than you do  And perhaps what they know is
 that very very few 21 and 22year old rookies come up to the majors
 and make an impact
