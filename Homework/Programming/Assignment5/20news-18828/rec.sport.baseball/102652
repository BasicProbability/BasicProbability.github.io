	I totally agree with each point you made  Jose Viscaino looked
like a single A hitter up there  Who swings on 31 count with Maddux 
pitching and your teams down by a run and you havent touched the ball all 
day

Oh this is an easy trivia question  The answer is any Cub not named
Sandberg or Grace

      I also think too much is made of that leftyrighty thing  Watching
the Cubs games I get the feeling Steve Stone knows a lot more about what
the Cubs should be doing than Lefebre does  Harry said it best when he
stated after another terrible Vizcaino at bat we cant wait til
Sandberg returns

 
David M Nieporent     Only one thing wrong with theory
nieporntphoenix        Is stupid  Is stupidest theory I ever heard
