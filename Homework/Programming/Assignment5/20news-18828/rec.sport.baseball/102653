Orioles vs Texas at Camden Yards April 5 Opening Day

Batting 9th for Texas playing Second Base

	BILLY  RIPKEN

The hometown crowd gave their favorite ex2nd Baseman a 2minute standing
ovation as Billy wearing flashy shades took the cheers smiling and
waving

	Consummate role player in the words of PA caller Jon Miller
Tim Hulett failed to receive similar cheers when announced  Mainly because
he didnt have the courtesy to show up

Wasnt Hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball
while running bases  I heard something about him recieving stiches and a
possible broken nose  Is he at the park

	Fernando was warmly received good to see that

Lets see how they feel when hes 0 and 4 with a 49 ERA  I have my
doubts about Fernando

	FYI when Cal was announced Jon Miller says
	It seems like yesterday when this young manbegan a consecutive
game streak  10time AllStar 2 time MVP 2 time gold glover our
future Hall of Fame shortsop batting 3rd Cal Ripken  The Standing O
lasted about 15 seconds  145 less than Billy  Blargh

Well when a fan favorite gets dumped hes gonna get an outstanding
ovation on his first return  Lets add up the ovations Cal has recieved
over the years during the game and compare that to Billy

BTW Sutcliffes getting knocked around pretty good  Rangers up 5  1 in
the bottom of the fourth
