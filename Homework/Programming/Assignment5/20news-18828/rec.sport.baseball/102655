I AM DOING A POSTITION PAPER ON THE DESIGNATED HITTER RULE ANY INFORMATION
OR EVEN OPINIONS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECITATED 00ECGILLESPIE MAGIC

Should be rescinded  The rules say baseball is a game between two teams of 
nine players each  Lets keep it that way

Not any more the rules dont say that  So thats a pretty dumb argument
