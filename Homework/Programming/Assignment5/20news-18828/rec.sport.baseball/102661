And I thought Mota didnt really start pinchhitting for a 
living until after 1973

Depends on what you mean by for a living  1974 was the year he led the
league in pinchhit at bats with 50 but hed been getting a lot of PH ABs
earlier than that and was never a fulltime player  2035 PH ABs early in
his career 1520 a year just before going to the Dodgers and 3050 in the
peak years

Were talking about a guy with a 20year career as an outfielder a 300
career batting average and 1130 or so career hits
