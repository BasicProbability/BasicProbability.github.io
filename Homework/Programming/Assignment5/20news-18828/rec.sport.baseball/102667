Subject 15day 30day 60day disabled list questions


 Ive a curiousity 

  Whenever a person is put on the 15day 30day or 60day 
 the person is on the list longer than the specificed time

  Ive seen a person on the 15day for maybe 4 months last year I dont
 remember what

 I just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications
