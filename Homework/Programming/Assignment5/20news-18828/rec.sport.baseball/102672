 Stay in school  You have a lot to learn
 
 Learn what  I know that 3 million dollars is A LOT of money  I  
know 
 Rickey Henderson doesnt have a career out of baseball  I know if  
he 
 didnt have baseball he wouldnt be making near the money he is  
now
 

And Michael Jackson Jack Nicholson and Bill Cosby wouldnt be 
making near as much money if they werent entertainers So whats
your point

 I just dont understand how some athlete who only plays a sport  
for a 
 living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough
 
 If nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one  
hurting
 The As will still win without him

Will they  You cant usually take away one of the teams best
players and still expect them to win  Or do you think the 
Pirates will continue to win without Barry Bonds

 
 Remeber many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their  
athletic 
 ability  NOTHING  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard  
working
 citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay

So Again Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens and much more than Rickey Henderson for that
matter 

 
 I dont have a problem with them making millions  My problem is  
when the
 say they arent being paid enough when they already get 3  
millionalso
 their numbers get worse

The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career when they
are on the decline There are exceptions of course Dave Parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose
