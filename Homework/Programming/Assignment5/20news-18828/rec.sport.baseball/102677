Being a baseball fan and a fan of the above mentioned band I was
wondering if anyone could clue me in on whether the Dead or members
of sang the national anthem at todays Giant opener

I would imagine that it is a bit too early for anyone to know but
an answer would be greatly appreciated

It is my understanding that the Dead will sing the NA at the Giants
home opener on Mon 412 The Giants are opening today in St Louis
