Subject Re 15day 30day 60day disabled list questions

  Whenever a person is put on the 15day 30day or 60day 
 the person is on the list longer than the specificed time

  Ive seen a person on the 15day for maybe 4 months last year I dont
 remember what

 I just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications

I believe we are down to two  the 15day and the 60day  I dont remember 
a 30day but rather a 21day  Anyways its gone now  The period length 
is a minimum not a maximum  You can keep a guy on the 15day for as long 
as you want IF hes still certified as injured  The player must be 
periodically reevaluated to determine if hes still injured thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers  If you get someone qualified for the 60day 
that reduces the frequency of reevaluations  There is no longer I 
believe any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL  When 
there was you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists
