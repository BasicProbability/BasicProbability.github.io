 I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect
 I have
 for Jim LeFebvre after seeing todays Cubs game 
 						A dishard Cub fan


Yes I also wonder if they can win with this manager
I never believed managers had that much to do with winning
until I saw how much they had to do with losing

I like the Mariners a lot but my heart belongs to the CubsYou can imagine
my frustration when I saw the Cubs nabbing LeFebvreARHGGHRGHH
