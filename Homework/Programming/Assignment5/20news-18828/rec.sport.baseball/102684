 im watching a cubsrockies spring training game and i thought youd
 all like to know the particular way that harry caray butchers maldonado
 
 it seems to be malndalnado

But I like the way he butchers Andres Galarragas name

It comes out like gahlah rrrraggggah

And dont forget his frequent references to the great SF Giant star
Bobby Bonds

What about Thaaammy Thotha I for one was really sorry to hear that the
Cubs had sent Heathcliff Slocumb to the minors
