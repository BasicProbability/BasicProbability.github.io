anyone who writes dean palmer has 2 homers   at this pace hell
 have 324 home runs should be shot



Now on the other hand Juan Gonzales probably DOES have a shot at
324 HRs  

The Dodgers after one inning of play have committed one error  At this rate
theyll have 1455 errors this season

Well maybe Im right this time
