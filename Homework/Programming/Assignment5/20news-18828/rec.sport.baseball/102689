    The NYYankees are now one game closer to the ALEast pennant  They 
clobbered Cleveland 91 on a fine pitching performance by Key and two 
homeruns by Tartabullfirst MLbaseball to go out this season and a three 

How many home runs by Tartabull  Just 1 right you must be thinking
of Dean Palmer or Juan Gonzalez both of Texas who each had 2 homers

run homer by Nokes  For all of you who didnt pick Boggs in your pools 
tough break he had a couple hits and drove in a couple runswith many more 

I dont know how many to follow but he was 1 for 4

 GO YANKS Mattingly for gglove and MVP and Abbot for Cy Young

Spare us please
