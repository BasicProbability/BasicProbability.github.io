Look at all that Teal  BLEAH

Indeed if the color teal on a teams uniforms is any indication of the
future the Marlins are in dire trouble Refer to the San Jose Sharks for
proof But I have hope for the Marlins I was a sometime member of the
Rene Lachemann fan club at the Oakland Coliseum and have a deep respect
for the guy Hes a gem And of course Walt Weiss gives that franchise
class But yeah whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity
of style and imagination Ugghhh
