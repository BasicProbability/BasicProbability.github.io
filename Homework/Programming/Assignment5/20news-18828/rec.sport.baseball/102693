Subject Re Young Catchers

Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of
approx 40 posts going back to The Braves could be better off
if an injury happens I may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame

1  Back at the beginning of Spring Training I though
Lopez would make the squad easily  Olson was still
recovering from his lateseason injury knee I believe
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before June  And then Berryhill was dinged up

I was looking forward to this because I believe that Lopez
can hit AND field the position  Before last season he was
the Braves Defensive Catcher prospect while Brian Deak was
the Braves Offensive Catcher prospect  Besides Olson
and Berryhill couldnt hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box and dont walk enough to be useful

But Olson recovered quickly Berryhill recovered and the Braves went
with the two vets  I still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season he wouldnt have gotten his job back

2  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around
After all ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher
California and Seattle come to mind  Certainly trying to
move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work
Plus youd have to eat that salary which isnt huge but isnt
tiddleywinks either I think Olsons at about 800000 Berryhill
at 450000 but thats only what I recall

3  Yes I think arbitrationeligibility may have a role to
play in this also  What is it that 56 of the 2year players
arent eligible for arbitration   Only the 16 that were on the roster
the longest are eligible  Of course the system may change
but the extent of that change is not yet known  From a business
standpoint it may make sense to keep Lopez down until Junethe
first time OlsonBerryhill go on the DL

4  I am still disappointed that Lopez isnt on the team
I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves
and the truth is that Id rather see our best team on the field
which IMO includes Lopez

Of coursetoday we play the Cubs  Hopefully we wont need him 

As for the SchuerholzCox conversation I imagine it went
like this  Remember theyve BOTH been GMs
the following is not meant to be read by the humorimpaired

Cox  OK weve sent Jones down  His fielding could be a
little smoother  Besides Blauser can hit OK and his fielding
is better than it used to be

Schuerholz  Well well have to send Nieves down too  Deion
just wont sign that baseball only contract  We cant count
on him in October so we have to keep Nixon around for the
defense  Besides Gormans not ready to give up on
Billy Hatcher yet  Once Hatchers gone AND Deion signs
we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez  That ought to
give us some pitching depth in 1995

Cox  Yep thatll be nice  Too bad Deion wont sign
OK Ill look for Nieves when Justice starts having
BerryBerryer back problems again  Now what about
Klesko

Schuerholz  Well weve still got to fork out another 15 mil
for Bream  If we keep Klesko we either lose the money
or Cabrera  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell
but somehow he doesnt seem to be the same GM  First
Jeffries for Jose and now Whiten for Clark  If he
gets rid of Brian Jordan then Id HAVE to believe that he
and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings

Cox  OK keep trying on Bream and Ill wait til the trading
deadline for my HunterKlesko platoon  Maybe I can get a few
extra atbats for Cabrera while we wait  Try California
if Snow starts slowly maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid
And if that doesnt work then perhaps Sids knees
could be persuaded to act up  Theres always the
15day DL  Mwahahahaha

Schuerholz  What about Caraballo

Cox  Well hes not that much better than Lemke  Maybe if he starts
in Richmond hell start walking more  Besides if hes going to be
arbitrationeligible better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks

Schuerholz  Now lets see  That leaves Lopez

Cox  NOOOOO  I gotta keep Lopez  Sure I didnt think Olson
would recover this quickly  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into
running into him again

Schuerholz  Nope Lopez has gotta go  You know that hell get
3 million in arbitration  May as well put it off that one
extra year  Besides until Olsons shown his stuff a little
bit I cant trade him  Besides Berryhills a lefthanded
hitter  You know how rare that is

Cox  Dont you mean a lefthanded whiffer  Pretty common
if you ask me  I mean he made Pat Borders look good in
the World Series  PAT BORDERS

Schuerholz  Hey youre the one who wouldnt write Lopez
into the lineup

Cox  Well youre the one who went out and got me Jeff
Reardon  Besides I thought Lopez wouldnt be used
to our pitching staffs stuff  He got some time with
them this springlooked pretty good  Come on surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate

Schuerholz  Yeah but which stiff  Whichever one we keep
will be hurt by May

Cox  OK OK you made your point  Keep them both  Surely
one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest  Then I
can call up Lopez and then we can win 110 games  The Pennant
THE WORLD SERIES  Ill be up there with John McGraw  Casey
Stengel  Earl Weaver  Oh they laughed at me in Toronto
but have you ever had to deal with George Bell  Ill finally
get my just reward  Mwahahaha

Schuerholz  Easy Bobby  Have you been taking those
happy pills left around by Chuck Tanner  Whyd you
ever hire that guy anyhow

Cox  Dont ask me ask Ted
