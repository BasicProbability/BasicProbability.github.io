Subject Cubs behind Marlins How

Ive noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubshow

First Base

Grace vs DestradeCould Destrade be the second coming of Cecil
Fielder I doubt it If Destrade performs to the height of expectations
then even otherwise edge to Cubs

Second Base

Sandberg vs BarberieNo contest Sandberg will be back May 1 Edge
to Cubsa big edge

Shortstop

Vizcaino vs WeissVizcaino is excellent defensively but is an
automatic out at bat Weiss isnt much better with the stick Even

Third Base

Dave Magadan vs BuechelleMagadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter
Buechelle has more power and is better defensively I think Edge to
Florida

Catcher 

Santiago vs WilkinsWilkins is OK but Santiago is better Edge to
Marlins

Left Field

Conine vs MaldonadoWow 4 for 4 yesterdayI know Conine has potential
I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years Until he actually proves
himself I give Maldonado the edge however like at 1B this is position
where Florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year

Center

Scott Pose vs WilsonMayEdge to May even if Wilson Hopefully the
Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like May
isnt Ken Griffey Jr but he will hit 275 with 15 homers if he plays
full time

Right

Felix vs SosaFelix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP So does
Sosa but Sosa also has speed and a good glove Edge to Cubs

Starters

Aquino Armstrong Hammond A lot of fifth starters here The Cubs wont
remind anyone of the Brave staff but MorganCastilloGuzmanHibbard
is average to OKbetter than the Marline Edge to Cubs

Middle Relief

Even The Cubs have some decent middlemen and so do the Marlins
Carpenter anf Klink or decent but so are Assenmacher and McElroy

Closer

A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins Meyers is decent but
no Harvey Of course the Cubs may have a few more games to save
Look for 30 saves 5 blown from Meyers and 25 saves 3 blown with
a better ERA for Harvey Edge Florida

Overall an edge to Chicago
Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything of course
