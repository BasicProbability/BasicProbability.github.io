Subject Joe Robbie Stadium NOT FOR BASEBALL
Date 6 Apr 93 025027 GMT
Did anyone notice the words NOT FOR BASEBALL printed on the picture
of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA
Today Any reason given for this


I would assume that the words I saw the picture indicated that those 
SEATS will not be available for baseball games  If you look at the picture 
of the diamond in the stadium in relation to the areas marked NOT FOR 
BASEBALL those seats just look terrible for watching baseball   Now if 
they should happen to reach the postseason I would imagine that they 
would consider opening some of those seats up but that is surely a worry 
of the future

In the champion people see what theyd like to be  In the loser
 they see what they actually are and they treat him with scorn

Sugary condiments secure initial pleasure but fermented grain is
 decidedly more parsimonious of time
