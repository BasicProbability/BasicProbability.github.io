     The NYYankees are now one game closer to the ALEast pennant   
They 
 clobbered Cleveland 91 on a fine pitching performance by Key and two 
 homeruns by Tartabullfirst MLbaseball to go out this season and a  
three 
 run homer by Nokes  For all of you who didnt pick Boggs in your pools 
 tough break he had a couple hits and drove in a couple runswith many  
more 
 to follow  The Yanks beat an up and coming team of youngsters in the 
 Indians  The Yankees only need to win 95 more games to get the  
division
  GO YANKS Mattingly for gglove and MVP and Abbot for Cy Young
