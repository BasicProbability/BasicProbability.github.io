  ARGH Here is where you are obviously dead wrong Not since the Yankees 
  of the 20s and 30s has a team been so nicely setup as this yearsand 
  years to come Braves I dont think that the AllStar team will be able  
 This may be an appropriate comparison
 The 192931 Yankees finshed 2nd 3rd and 2nd finshing 
 18 16 and 1312 games out of first 
 In 193334 and 35 they also finished second  though they were only
 7 7 and 3 games out
 Even great teams can lose  Thats why they play the season
 on the other hand Im still picking the Braves to go all the way

 Um surely you didnt intend to compare the 93 Reds with the
 29 Philidelphia As  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to
 a team that was as good as the 2628 Yankees while the
 Yankees had aged some from their peak years  Ruth and Gehrig
 couldnt play every position simultaneously
 
 IMO given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season
 that the Braves will be closer to their peak while the Reds
 have slightly passed their peak
 
 Also if youre going to compare Braves and Yankees a more appropriate
 comparison to the 93 Braves might be the 23 Yankees  
 After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series
  both teams wonwill win the Series this year despite the
 heroics of some old fart on the other team 
 Casey Stengel Dave Winfield

Perhaps so I was only responding to the Yankees of the 20s and 30s 
part of the comment If those teams were a sure thing and lost 
then its probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another 
team not that I did
