Subject Re Info needed for Cleveland tickets

 Im going to be in Cleveland Thursday April 15 to Sunday April 18
 Does anybody know if the Tribe will be in town on those dates and
 if so whore they playing and if tickets are available

The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th
There are ALWAYS tickets available Though they are playing Toronto
and many Toronto fans make the trip to Cleveland as it is easier to
get tickets in Cleveland than in Toronto  Either way I seriously
doubt they will sell out until the end of the season
