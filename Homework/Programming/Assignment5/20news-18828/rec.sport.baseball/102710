 Heres one I remember sort of
 Yogis asleep in a hotel room late at night and gets a call from someone
 After he answers the phone the person at the other end asks if he woke Yogi
 up Yogi answered No the phone did

One of my favorites came back in the seventies when two
streakers interupted a game Yogi was at dashing across the
field unclad  Later someone who wasnt present asked Yogi
if they were men or women  He replied I couldnt tell
they had bags over their heads
