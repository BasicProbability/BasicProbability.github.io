We know that very very few players at this age make much of an impact
in the bigs especially when they havent even played AAA ball  

Yes  But this is irrelevant  Youre talking about averages when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on

Do you really have that much information on him  Really

I dont personally but Clay just posted it  Yes we do  

Unfortunately it shows that Lopez wasnt as good an example as Nieves would
have been since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years which I didnt have access to

The point remains though knowing a guys minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history if you know how to read it

Why isnt Lopez likely to hit that well  He hit that well last year after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an
absolute scale than Olson or Berryhill did  By a lot

I dont know  You tell me  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLEs in their rookie season  Were talking about
1993 you know

The MLE is not a projection its an equivalence  Its a this is how
well he hit last year in major league terms rating  So in essence he
has already reached it  I would guess Bob  Clay that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons  Maybe
more than half since all of these players are young and improving

If that were your purpose maybe  Offerman spent 1992 getting 
acclimated if you will  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season  

Did they  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
and last place but no more

Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant

Sure they didnt have anyone better  I suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really
in contention 

The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample but rather that he
hadnt done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him
down until he gets warmed up

For a stathead Im amazed that you put any credence in spring
training  

If youd read what I wrote youd be less amazed  Nowhere do I claim to put
any credence in spring training  Quite the contrary I said that Lopez hadnt
done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training
could interpret as failure  Just because I think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesnt mean that Bobby Cox does its just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down

The kid will improve playing at AAA 

Just like Keith Mitchell did

Wait a minute  I missed something here  

Keith Mitchell did very very well at AA AAA and the majors over a season
then did very very poorly for a year in AAA
