 When the Giants protected Mike Benjamin career average 160 ovre pitcher
 Pat Rapp there were surprised looks in the Bay Area
 
 Benjamins stats 333364571 42 ab 14 H 4 doubles 2 dingers
 
 And Rapps even been sent down to AAA  So its even better than that
 eh
 
 Of course the protected list was done by the OLD regime not the new so
 this is Rosens baby not Quinns
 
 And Ill tell you what Lets look at this again at the end of the season
 and say in three years and see who the genius is One of the more
 braindead decisions by the OldGiants IMHO Even if Benjamin DOES improve
 markedly over the past and his hitting is better hes never going to be
 more than a utilitybackup IF Rapp might turn into a topflight arm in
 another year

I think the next time I post something like this I obviously need to make
the sarcasm a bit more obvious
