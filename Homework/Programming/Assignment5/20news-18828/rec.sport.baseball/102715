 Am I the only person who thinks the Reds sleeveless uniforms are
 ugly  Yet another reason why they wont win the NL West 
 

 If uniforms really were a deciding factor in pennant races the 79 Pirates
 would have never won anything those have to be the ugliest uniforms Ive
 ever seen particular the allyellow set

My vote goes for the 75 Indians with their allred uniforms
Boog Powell once said he felt like a big red blood clot
