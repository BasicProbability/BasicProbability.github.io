Heres an interesting quote from Bill Veek from Get that Nigger off
the Field
        Josh Gibson was at minimum two Yogi Berras
Speaking of Yogi anybody know any good Yogiisms
Mike Curious George Stultz

Heres one I remember sort of
Yogis asleep in a hotel room late at night and gets a call from someone
After he answers the phone the person at the other end asks if he woke Yogi
up Yogi answered No the phone did
