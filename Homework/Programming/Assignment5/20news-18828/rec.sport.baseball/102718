Subject Joe Robbie Stadium NOT FOR BASEBALL

Did anyone notice the words NOT FOR BASEBALL printed on the picture
of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA
Today Any reason given for this

Also I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in
the preview On 82289 Rickey Henderson became Nolans 5000th strikeout
On 61190 he pitched his 6th nohitter against Oakland I believe the
last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson And on 5191 Nolan
pitched his 7th nohitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base which overshadowed it It seems that Nolan is having a lot of
publicity at Rickeys expense IMO Rickey deserves it and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what Ive seen on it lately They are
both great players but IMO Nolan has outclassed Rickey both in playing
and more importantly in attitude Just my thoughts
