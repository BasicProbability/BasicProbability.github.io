As for rushing  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and I dont
believe there is then wouldnt you rather waste Lopezs 22year old good
season than his 23year old very good season or his 24yearold excellent
season  The sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to
use

Can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors lets for
arguments sake define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger and performing below
expectations whose career was damaged by this rushing  Im serious I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better but
Id like to look at players for whom this theory didnt work if there are
any  Id prefer players within the last 10 years or so because then I can
look up their minor league stats  Its important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected as opposed to players who were hyped and failed but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers  

Lets kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed although
there doesnt seem to have been any damage to his career  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21 and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22 and still underperformed  However the next year at
age 24 his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job
and has been there ever since  Its really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was
performed quite well in AAA during this time rather than being rushed
Cleveland might have been better off I suppose because they might have
been less likely to give up on him

Yes if you bring a player up early hes likely going to struggle  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling and starts
performing up to expectations
