Stay in school  You have a lot to learn

Learn what  I know that 3 million dollars is A LOT of money  I know 
Rickey Henderson doesnt have a career out of baseball  I know if he 
didnt have baseball he wouldnt be making near the money he is now

I just dont understand how some athlete who only plays a sport for a 
living for millions of dollars say he is not being paid enough

If nobody will sign him for his asking price he will be the one hurting
The As will still win without him

Remeber many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their athletic 
ability  NOTHING  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard working
citizens and they are complaining of not enough pay

I dont have a problem with them making millions  My problem is when the
say they arent being paid enough when they already get 3 millionalso
their numbers get worse
