Subject Re Young Catchers

Most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs  Those are the arguments against Lopez for the
Braves for this year

Now  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out
runners  

	This is the crux of the argument to me at least  Both the
SDCN and the nonSDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catchers
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present  You can talk about how
important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls
in the dirt  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catchers rank in defense  

	Looking at Lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher  As far as I
can tell he doesnt have any particular problem in his mechanics
such as Sasser  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time  I cant see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors  

	All were left with is the calling the game aspect  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavines pitches is to catch Tom Glavine  Similarly I wouldnt
be supprised if the pitchers claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez

	Now since Lopez cant learn how to handle the major league
pitchers while hes in AAA and since he doesnt have any glaring
problem in his mechanics what is he going to learn in AAA that he
cant learn just as well while in the majors
