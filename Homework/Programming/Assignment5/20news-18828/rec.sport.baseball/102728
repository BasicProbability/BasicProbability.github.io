Now Keith Mitchell  As I recall no stat books handy  surprise
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991  He did so well that he was
returned to the minors where he didnt do very well at all  Now
his career is in jeopardy  So how does he fit in with your 
point  Good MLEs in AA  Moved him right to the big club  Now
hes one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball
Duh

Methinks you recall wrong Mitchell hit close to 300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion He was then I think left
off the playoff roster and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down 

he struggled last year no doubt but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion Id much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on
the Cards
