I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an OriolesRed Sox game in  
Baltimore on Saturday July 31st  I havent been to the new park
and I was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips  
or anything helpful about the place so that I can enjoy every moment spent
there
For instance what time do the gates open  Do we see the Orioles take BP
When will the Red Sox take BP  Anything you can tell me would be 
appreciated  Thank you in advance 
Please respond to my email address
I know its still threeandahalf months away but Im psyched
