Youd think that an expansion team would be filled with youngns not guys
like Murphy Galaragga B Smith

It depends  If you can get your old veterans cheap and if they can perform
at a higher level than your young talent can now why not the talent 
develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer
If the veterans are gone in a year or two  that should be just about right

Maybe someone should tell those renegade front office people in Denver 

Open question  which was more important to the expansion clubs the expansion
draft or the regular draft  Theyve had one of each I think
