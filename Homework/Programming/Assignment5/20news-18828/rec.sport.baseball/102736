morgan and guzman will have eras 1 run higher than last year and
 the cubs will be idiots and not pitch harkey as much as hibbard
 castillo wont be good i think hes a stud pitcher

       This season so far Morgan and Guzman helped to lead the Cubs
       at top in ERA even better than THE rotation at Atlanta
       Cubs ERA at 0056 while Braves at 0059 We know it is early
       in the season we Cubs fans have learned how to enjoy the
       short triumph while it is still there
