 During the same time span the Braves developed John Smoltz Tom Glavine
 Steve Avery David Justice Ron Gant and Jeff Blauser among others
 
  Avery I believe came from the Phillies  Jeff Blauser

Avery was the 2 overall pick by the Braves behind Mark Lewis I think in
1988  John Smoltz came over to the Braves from the Tigers but was developed
by the Braves  Jeff Blauser isnt a bad player
