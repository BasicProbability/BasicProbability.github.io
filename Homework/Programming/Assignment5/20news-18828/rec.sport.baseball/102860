Subject Marlin fans
From csc2imdcabellvcuedu Ian M Derby


I was watching the DodgersMarlins game yesterday and a couple of
things impressed me  

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami it had a summer
atmosphere in early spring for baseball  In comparison Wrigley Field
in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
bundled up fans  

The second and most important was the fans  I like these guysgals
I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball
It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins  The way they were cheering I thought it was the
AFC playoffs  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities  

Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion
teams bring back some excitement  Well find out Friday how Denver
Bronco fans respond 

Phillies are 20 I better say it now before my opportunity passes
