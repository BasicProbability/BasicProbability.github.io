Subject Re FLORIDA SUCKS
From csc2imdcabellvcuedu Ian M Derby


This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary  VERY
scary  Dont get me wrong Im a Phillies fan but as late as last
year they looked helpless  The funny thing was they did have a lot
of injuries in 92 spring training that basically killed their
chances  Of course dont forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the
first or second game
