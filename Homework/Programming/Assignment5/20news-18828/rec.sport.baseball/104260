Subject The 1964 Phillies deja vu
From csc2imdcabellvcuedu Ian M Derby


After reading my local paper today I found out that the Phillies
started the 1964 season at 102  I am not as old as 1964 but Ive
heard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that
season They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in
midAugust  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the
Cardinals took the division  15 games ahead and lost it I
hope this season is MUCH different
