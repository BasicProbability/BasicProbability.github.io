Weird thing  Leading 204 going into the top of the ninth Sparky
	      used his ace closer Henneman  The tigers have 8 relievers
	      and at least 6 were restedavailable  Does Sparky trust
	      them that little 

I think he just wanted to get Henneman some work because the 
Tigers had days off both the day before and the day after
