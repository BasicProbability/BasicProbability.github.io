This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary  VERY
scary  Dont get me wrong Im a Phillies fan but as late as last
year they looked helpless  The funny thing was they did have a lot
of injuries in 92 spring training that basically killed their
chances  Of course dont forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the
first or second game

First game first at bat
