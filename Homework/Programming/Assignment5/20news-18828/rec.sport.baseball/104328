Didnt Bob Horner go straight from Arizona State Univ
to the Atlanta Braves I remember he had one great
month hitting dingers and then the next I heard
he was in Japan

A month  Well he did have a short careercompared to what one might
have expected for such a highly touted prospectdue to being injury prone
overweight and having no work ethic  But he certainly did not
suffer from being rushed to the bigs
