In a previous article 002251waxeacadiauca JASON WALTER WORKS says

    The NYYankees are now one game closer to the ALEast pennant  They 
clobbered Cleveland 91 on a fine pitching performance by Key and two 
homeruns by Tartabullfirst MLbaseball to go out this season and a three 
run homer by Nokes  For all of you who didnt pick Boggs in your pools 
tough break he had a couple hits and drove in a couple runswith many more 
to follow  The Yanks beat an up and coming team of youngsters in the 
Indians  The Yankees only need to win 95 more games to get the division
 GO YANKS Mattingly for gglove and MVP and Abbot for Cy Young
