 pitchers who are doing well are
 more likely to be taken out of the game in the nl than they are in the al
 so it seems to me that the al not the nl promotes pitchers duels

On what basis do you make this statement

                                Q Sean

are you serious pitchers are pinchhit for in the nl  they are not in the
nl  if a pitcher is cranking in the al he will stay in the game  if he
is cranking in the nl he may not  ESPECIALLY if its a pitchers duel
and his team needs an extra run
