Subject Re Brien Taylor Where is he

Last year Brein Taylor was in A ball probably at Tampa in the
Florida State League  I believe he began this year in AA which
is Albany  Hopefully George wont rush him and hell be
allowed to progress at his own rate to AAA and then to the
Bronx  This guy is the real thing
