And now the not so pleasant surprises

	2Tartabull The book on Tartabull was keep him healthy and
	  hell produce Well he hasnt done too much so far Sure hes
	  hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt
	  gotten any of the big RBIs that your cleanup man is supposed
	  to give you Then again he had a slow start last year once he
	  got off the DL that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew
See you in the Series

Lets see April 15th less than 30 at bats and you claim that he 
hasnt done too much so far

Cut this guy some slack Danny will produce this year Its scary to think
just how much hell produce if he were to stay healthy all year

The Yanks have a lot going for them this year good starting rotation good
bullpen good defense and a good lineup Also I like Buck Showalter Frank
Howard on 1st is also a good move Everything sounds good so far 

If the Yanks stay healthy they have a good chance at winning the pennant This 
is the most fun Ive had watching the Yanks since 78
