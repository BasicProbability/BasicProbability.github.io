Subject Old Predictions to laugh at


Oops  I came across this file from last year  Thought you might
enjoy some of these thoughts  The predictions were made on the
date indicated  They are largely out of order



June 11 1992

What have I done  I computed the expected winning percentage for
each team from their OBP total bases and runs allowed  I use the
basic RC formula and the pythagorean projection  I then compare this
with their actual winning percentage  All stats through June 7

Team           OBP    TB    RA     W     L    XWP  Diff
baltimore    0351   768   199    33    21  0647   36
boston       0334   580   176    26    25  0548   38
toronto      0319   750   221    34    22  0540    68
new york     0327   759   237    28    26  0523    5
milwaukee    0325   692   226    28    25  0498    31
detroit      0328   782   285    24    31  0448   11
cleveland    0316   688   274    22    34  0386     7

minnesota    0353   797   237    30    24  0585   29
oakland      0350   719   236    32    23  0532    50
texas        0324   815   281    33    26  0469    90
chicago      0325   601   212    25    27  0459    22
california   0307   664   231    22    32  0438   30
kansas city  0310   656   239    22    32  0420   13
seattle      0310   726   290    22    33  0376    24

You all know how things turned out  The Orioles Red Sox and Yankees
all disappeared  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half

The Rangers predictably took a dive  That shouldnt have surprised
anybody  Meanwhile as predicted the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals  They clearly didnt deserve the 2233 record in
June  The White Sox and As upped their game a bit while the Twins
dropped off a little  But for the most part things were as expected

Okay so there were a few blatant errors  But for a predictive
calculation I thought this did pretty well


From CAVGEOEYaleVMYCCYaleEdu Tue Mar 31 163634 1992
1 The Braves insert Kent Mercker into the starting rotation
sometime this year 1992  Bielecki is traded or released Lei
brandt becomes the fifth starter and the best bullpen in baseball
has Pena Berenguer Stanton Wohlers Freeman and Pete Smith who
spotstarts as well

Hm  Pete Smith made the rotation instead of Mercker  And Bielecki
wasnt released until the end of the year  I wont comment on the
bullpen  Jeff Reardon  

2 Blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end
of May  Bream goes on the DL and Klesko goes on a nice hitting
honeymoon a la Gregg Jefferies in 1988 platooning with Hunter
Mitchell wins the center field job a bit later AllStar break and
Nixon stays on as a valuable pinchrunner  Lonnie is released unless
the Braves find a taker in a trade

Right on Blauser  Wrong on Bream and Mitchell  A bit early on
Lonnie as with Bielecki  Didnt pick Sanders  Did anybody 

3 Managers to be fired this year 1992 in chronological order
Fregosi Showalter Valentine Riddoch

Three of them went right  Showalter is still around and likely to
stick it seems



From mattelAutotrolCOMmattelautotrolcom Tue Mar 31 170422 1992
1 Bonds gets traded from Bucs for some young talent

Nope  They won the division and so kept him for a shot at the
playoffs

2 Mets win division

  Well they didnt finish last

3 Atlanta repeats in the West

Got that one right

4 Yankees surprise everyone but finish second behind Toronto

Nope

5 Dwight Gooden wins 20 but is surpassed by Saberhagen who wins 22

I guess this is why you picked the Mets to win huh

6 Roger Clemens is injured early in the season

Tsk Tsk  Not nice to predict something like this

7 Strawberry fails to hit even 20 home runs and is often injured
8 Due to 7 Dodgers drop out of race

You got that right



And my response

From tedward Tue Mar 31 175742 1992

Hmph  Can tell you are a Mets fan  Do you mind if I make some counter
predictions against yours  They follow
2 Mets come in third behind Pittsburgh and Montreal

Okay so the Mets finished fifth  But I got the Pirates and Expos
right

4 The Yankees offense and pitching flounders dropping them to fourth
   place in the AL East  Boston wins 95 games the division the pennant
   and the World Series

First half  Dead on  Second half  Ummm  Im a Sox fan go easy
on me

5 Dwight Gooden rushes his comeback gets blown out and goes on the DL from
   May through midJuly
   Saberhagen runs a 500 record WFAN criticizes the Mets for giving away
   that great talent Jefferies who has a solid year in KC

So I got my predictions for Gooden and Saberhagen reversed    I
was at least close and was right about Jefferies  Though I dont
know  HAS WFAN criticized the Jefferies trade

6 Roger Clemens wins another CY as well as 20 games

Close  No cigar

 I will streak naked down Forbes avenue if HoJo does not muster more than
 a 792 OPS  Something is wrong with that projection

Some predictions need no introduction

From tedwardcscornelledu
Do you care to put your prediction down for posterity  You predict
Mark Grace will get 90 RBIs  I say you are out of your mind  That
is almost impossible for a 10HR type guy batting behind Dawson  Who
kills most of the rallies he doesnt finish

	Why do you say that Mark has driven in 82 90 and 79 89
Last year Mark was batting second primarily and it was his worse year
average wise Since he is batting either 3rd or 5th this year I predict 
he will be back up to his previous standards I think he will be better
90 rbis is not that much of a stretch

Sometimes us statheads get lucky  Grace didnt hit behind Dawson
the entire season but he also finished with only 79 RBIs



From nss3midwayuchicagoedu Tue May 19 220906 1992

The most ballsy prediction ever

Mark McGwire will hit 61 or more HRs this year

Nope  He slowed down and the injury finished him off  Didnt
even reach 50  But a ballsy prediction nonetheless



From ECAXRONMARSLERCNASAGOV Thu May 21 164221 1992
1 Baltimore will not fade  They will not win the division this year
    but they will finish within five games  I find the prospect of two
    Orioles winning 20 each easier to comprehend than that of two Sox
    No offense  I think their pitching is about as good as the division
    has to offer

The Orioles finished seven games out  None of them won 20 though
Mussina might have had a chance with better relief and more starts

2 Nobody else in the division is worth a darn  They all finish a minimum
    of fifteen games out the Tribe 30  Thats another reason to watch
    Baltimore this year and next  they wont waste many of those games 
    against the rest of the division

Except for the Brewers who you probably forgot you were right  The
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre  The Yankees and Indians
led with 76 wins the Red Sox trailed with 73 wins  None were
horrible but four were five or more games below 500

Right  That was me  I never said the Jays were a cinch to clinch it
but I said that Milwaukee will be more of a threat than Baltimore  I
do think that Toronto should win it but after 87 I dont consider
anything a cinch unless you have something like a 4 game lead with 3
games to go  I do think that the Jays have the best talented team in
the AL East and if we had a good or even average manager we might
have a bigger lead right now  I also think that the Orioles will not
play much better than 500 baseball for the rest of the season

You win



From kingcogsciUCSDEDU Thu Nov 14 143345 1991

In article 1991Nov130604139187cscornelledu you write
7 Indians	the first and only 0162 season ever  

Prediction  The Cleveland indians will win 70 or more games next year

You were right



From stvjasmeteorwiscedu Fri Sep 13 011552 1991

1 Jose Rijo will win the 1992 Cy Young award IF he is healthy enough to go
at least 210 IP Who would have thought he would try to steal a base Why
risk such an injury

He had 211 IP but didnt win the Cy Young  Maddux surprised all

2 The Orioles will win 88 games in at least 3 of the next 6 years
probably the last 3 and their pitching staff will have a team ERA
among the best 4 in the AL in at least 3 of the next 6 years but not
necessarily all the same years as they win 88 This one will take a
long time to verify

I dont think I want to wait that long  But they won 89 games last
year and they were fifth in the league in ERA  Not a bad start

4 Ben McDonald will not challenge for an ERA title in the next 2
years nor will he have 18 victories either year By challenge I
mean FINISH among the leaders being among the leaders BEFORE the
season is done doesnt count  He will probably never be the pitcher
he was hyped to be but is still a decent starter to have

Looks like it  He wasnt bad last year just too consistent to be an
ace  So far this year looks like more of the same

5 The Phillies will give up many fewer walks ifwhen they get rid of their
bullpen coach Ryan I am not predicting when or whether they will get rid
of him and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust 
before seeing the radical change They would have a fine pitching staff if 
they would just steal Ray Miller away from Pittsburg The White Sox seem to
have the same problem but not as bad

I honestly cant say  Did they get rid of him  Their BB totals were
down last year

7 Ricky Jordan will have 90 rbi IF he starts 145 games hitting in
the 3 or 4 or 5 spot in any lineup or the 6 spot in a lineup with very
good OBP in the 45 hitters This applies for each of the next 3
years

I just dont think hes that good

12 Billy Ripken will never again hit over 240 with 400 AB

  So far so good  Im definitely not waiting to check this one



From panixspiracmcl2NYUEDU Fri Sep 13 123808 1991

No matter what Lou Gorman and his scouts say Paul Quantrill will
never ever be an adequate major league starter  Never  I have never
seen a starting pitcher who can only strike out 3 per 9 innings at AAA
be successful in the majors

Current plans seem to be to use Quantrill in long relief  He has a
rubber arm and unusual delivery  He might be decent in that role

      MVP  92
AL  Frank Thomas

      Division Winners  92
AL East  Baltimore Orioles
AL West  Chicago White Sox
AL Pennant  Chicago White Sox
NL East  St Louis Cardinals

NL Pennant  Cincinatti Reds

Wrong on all of the above  Hal Morris 



And my favorites

From tedward Sun Oct 20 235257 1991

Belle will not walk as many as 50 times in 1992
Belle will hit more HR than he has walks in 1992

Belle hit 34 HR last year walking 52 times but five of those were
intentional  Okay so I exaggerate  But I might have been right



From trnstrdevjhuapledu Tue Mar 31 152528 1992

 Are the Os going to sign Cal of is Elis wallet welded shut outgoing 
 money only wide open for incoming cash 8

My prediction which you may make note of Valentine   is that Eli Jacobs
will defer any serious negotiations on Cal Ripkens contract until the 92
season is over  Eli will give Cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble
a bit from last years pace before coming forth with an offer

Despite claims that OPCY was designed to Cals strength my feeling is that
the 411 foot leftcenter canyon will cut down on Cals power stats

After all its hard to credibly to offer 34 millionyear to an
AllStar game MVPAL MVPGold Glove shortstopbaseball deity  
but itd be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously
declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full
season ago

Of course if Cal does match his 91 numbers then Eli is going to be faced
with a rather huge and expensive problem

How much did Cal sign for  When did he sign  If I remember
correctly he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season



And finally

From jpalmeruwovaxuwoca Thu Sep 12 103558 1991

Generally because of expansion in 1993 there will be a lot of
mediocre talent hanging around Much of it will not make it as the
expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their
teams My specific predictions

As of April 7 1993

Jim Acker and Cory Snider will be selling aluminum siding

Snyder is still in SF  Acker is gone

Neither Charlie Kerfeld nor Vance Lovelace presently in Tiger AA but
formerly big leaguers will be playing professional ball

They arent in the majors

Nor will Dave Rozema who says hes keeping in shape with a hope for
another shot with expansion

Never heard of him

Shawn Hare and Jody Hurst will be in the major leagues
They are outfielders in the Tiger minor league system

I dont think they are in the majors

Ron Hassey will be a minor league manager with the Yankees

Dunno what happened to him

It will be byebye for Balboni

If hes still around hes stuck in the minors

Bo Jackson will not be a starter

Hm  With Raines out Bo looks to get a lot of PT

Gary Huckaby will have moved to Alaska permanently theyre on the
net 



and Dave Kirsch will return to Canada to live

Hm



Thanks for listening
Valentine
