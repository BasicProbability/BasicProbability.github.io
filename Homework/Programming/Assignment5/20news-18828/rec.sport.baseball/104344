Why are the Red Sox in first place  Eight games into the season they
already have two wins each from Clemens and Viola  Clemens starts
again tonight on three days rest

Whats up  Are the Sox going with a fourman rotation  Is this why
Hesketh was used in relief last night

Hm

Cheers
Valentine
PS I was wrong  The Sox have already scored 18 runs in two games
this week  They should reach 25 without trouble  I still think its
a fluke
