Spanky isnt very good defensively anymore hes an offensive liability and
judging from his outburst this winter after the Bucs failed to sign Drabek
hes a jerk with his head in the sand Tommy Prince on the other hand cant
hit In the paper Simmons was citing the case of Tom Pagnozzi who never hit
in the minors or majors but suddenly somehow learned how 

Geez Dal must have slipped something into Teds drink sometime  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and hes now 27 years old I think  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors  Ill bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I dont have
another brain cramp and forget  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors  As I recall the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit decent fielding  When he got to the 
majors and didnt hit as well as expected not as much playing time he 
became Exhibit 312 in Nichols Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher  Its not clear he ever learned to
hit  His four years with more than 100 AB

No power lessthanleagueaverage walks peak year when he turned 28 
now declining  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors its not
a rosy picture

BTW Im still unhappy with moving Zeile who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi except that he was
a much much better hitter to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a wellabove average hitter
as an average or below average fielding catcher
