Subject Re Astros Are Back

Keeping in line with the pessimists on the net Ill hold off on the Astros
being all the way back  They could indeed contend but that would count on
  1 Atlanta encountering some unforeseen problems such as injuries or keeping
     up their early season abysmal hitting

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect  They dont have a real closer  although
Mike Stanton 4 saves has been used in that role  Didnt Stanton start off
great last year and then falter  Despite this your point is well taken
Atlanta doesnt seem to have the same personality as a NY team thus is 
unlikely to selfdestruct  For Houston to take em Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries particularly to their starting rotation


  2 Astros relief corps holding together  If Doug Jones keeps his changeup
     effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective then its passable
     Theres no reasonable lefthanded help and the middle relief is iffy
     Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role but
     hes been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway  
     Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money so they let him
     go  Doug Jones can lose his touch  he went from Clevelands allstar
     closer to the minors in a pretty short span

  From what I understand Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
club  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houstons success  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West 

lousey spring
     closer to the minors in a pretty short span


      Right  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling
      bullpen


     bit of shakiness at the fifth starter slot but thats basically normal
  4 Taubensee Anthony Gonzalez and Cedeno fulfilling some hitting potential
     Anthony appears to be about there Taubensees swing looks a lot better
     this year solid knock against Expos last night Gonzalez is showing 
     some early power and Cedeno still has the loopiest swing this side of
     Tim Wallach

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far  Biggio and Finley just arent doing their job of getting
      on base  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finleys job  Biggio concerns me since he usually
      starts the season very strong


                                     

     On a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next years uniform  There is talk that their road uniform will be
blech traditional grey with the word HOUSTON written across the
chest  If Im not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange shiver  McLanes favorite color is red so
     Im really upset the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible  Id like to see the uniform of the mid1980s return  They
may not have been pretty but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball  and I liked it

end of the bargain remember two years ago a little relief goes a long way
then they COULD win 90 games  But I doubt it  Ill project them at 85 wins
