Also in particular a colleague of mine is looking for any information he
can find on Moe Berg catcherlinguistespion of WW2  Any references or
anecdotes for that matter would be appreciated

Moe Berg my hero  We were just talking about him on Monday at the
Yankee game  Well theres a book about him thats just been reissued
I think the title is Moe Berg Athlete Scholar Spy by Tom Sewell
and two other people whose names I forget  Sewell wrote the chapter
on Berg in Danny Pearys book Cult Baseball Players this is a good
source for some of the more famous anecdotes about Berg  Also excellent
is the section on him in Bill Gilberts book They Also Served about
baseball during WWII  Im told Bergs spy activities are mentioned in
the recent book Heisenbergs War

His sister also wrote a book about Moe that she selfpublished The 
title is something like My Brother Morris Berg Its mainly some of
her memories and page after page of Xerox copies of pictures and letters
that Moe had saved Copies are kinda hard to find but the Smith Baseball
Library has one for those in Minneapolis

We have one here at Bergs alma mater class of 1923  Its kind of 
a sour thing she disapproved of the job that Sewell et al had done
