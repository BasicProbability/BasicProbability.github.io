Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball

	Hes not the greatest  this is true

For anyone who didnt see Sundays game

	I saw it

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey both right handers

	Lankford was hurt although the announcer said he told Torre he
	could pinch hit if they needed him to

Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Hell
is he thinking

	I wondered the same thing  But giving Joe the benefit of the 
	doubt Id say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that
	he didnt trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
	speed on the bases so pinch run him  Alicea I was completely
	confused about  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that
	particular pitcher  I dont know  Anybody got an idea

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench  Gilkey hit over 300 last year
what does he have to do to start The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league

	Well so far I havent seen much to say Whiten shouldnt be playing
	but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play 
	Jordan ahead of him  That I dont quite understand

Furthermore in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home 

	Yup I looked for this on the replay too  If Im Joe Torre Im
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one  Hes
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe  a hot hitter  
	coming up  theres no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign 
	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands  
	Its his job to watch the play develop  he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw  That seemed inexcusable in my book  
	BTW I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation  On the 
	replay theres Dent waving him around  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem  The Cards werent good base runners at all last year 
	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching


I cant take this anymore

	Well Im still hanging in there

	GO REDBIRDS  WOOF WOOF
