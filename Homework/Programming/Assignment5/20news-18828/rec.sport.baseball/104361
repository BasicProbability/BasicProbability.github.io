Oops  I came across this file from last year  Thought you might
enjoy some of these thoughts  The predictions were made on the
date indicated  They are largely out of order

much crap deleted

3 Managers to be fired this year 1992 in chronological order
Fregosi Showalter Valentine Riddoch

Three of them went right  Showalter is still around and likely to
stick it seems

DEAD WRONG  Last time I checked Jim Fregosi was still managing the
Phillies and doing quite a fine job thank youbest record in
baseball at 81

MY PREDICTION FOR 1993
Jim Fregosi will win manager of the year in the NL

dont flame meflame the bum who thinks he got fired last year
PAY ATTENTION KIDDO
