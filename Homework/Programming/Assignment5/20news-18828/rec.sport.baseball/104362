Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME

Steve Tomassi writes

     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Dont you think he deserves it
I
 
mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as

is Lee Smith ha then why dont we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell

Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie

Murray and Jeff Reardon

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving

Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards
marginal

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there Theyre both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal

     Lets be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
so

liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if
something

isnt done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential

candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to

the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan



Q Steve

	Whats the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount  Both have hung
around for years and continue to post great stats  Why shouldnt Dave Kingman
get into the Hall  Or Murray Evens Reardon and others  What the hell do
you have to do  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should
be in the hall  God  Pretty soon youll be saying that Cal Ripken doesnt
deserve to be in the Hall  Then Ill flame you
