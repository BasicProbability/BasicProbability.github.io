 Didnt Bob Horner go straight from Arizona State Univ
 to the Atlanta Braves I remember he had one great
 month hitting dingers and then the next I heard
 he was in Japan
 A month  Well he did have a short careercompared to what one might
 have expected for such a highly touted prospectdue to being injury prone
 overweight and having no work ethic  But he certainly did not
 suffer from being rushed to the bigs

Sorry Len this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs
Being overweight and having no work ethic leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose might have been corrected in Richmond  Did you intend a 
smiley after your comment

This brings back the long suffering memories of prechop Braves fans who
kept being promised the Bob Horner  Dale Murphy back to back power slam  Who
could stop that  Guess well never know

PS  Rocky fans are there any yet  Is Dale getting any playing time out
there  I plan to be at the game on June 28th theyll have to play him then
