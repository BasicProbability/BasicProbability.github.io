 Hi All
 
 Does anyone know who were the 4 pitchers for the 1961 Orioles 
 that were referred to as the Kiddy Corp because they were so young

Steve Barber  22   1812
Chuck Estrada 23   159
Jack Fisher   22   1013
Milt Pappas   22   139


	This list brings to mind possible the worst trade since Babe for
	NONO NANNETTE ie Milt Pappas for Frank Robinson I think in
	1965  Robinson proceeded to win the triple crown in 1966 and
	may have beaten out Yaz in 67 but was injured on a slide into 
	second when he collided with the mighty Al Weis Chisox
