Subject Scoring runs Was Re Notes on Jays vs Indians Series


In article 8966bluecispittedu dtatepittedu David M Tate writes

 Uh right  You also forgot that you cant get an RBI barring a HR with
 nobody on base  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR

Actually for the Padres this year so far its 23  They are 5th in
the league in HRs and ALL have been solo shots

Pythagorean projection puts them at 360 winning percentage
or 58104  Need some pitching help fast

Good news though is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
wo any pain  Threw 80 pitches yesterday  Should be back
in a couple of weeks  Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees
for Militello
