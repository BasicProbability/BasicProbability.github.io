Some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 1993
edition of the Bronx Bombers so far

First the pleasant

	1Spike Owen  All through spring training this guy was 
	  looking like the second coming of Mike Gallego but with
	  even worse hitting Now the guy is third in the major leagues
	  in BA and hes ranked pretty high in total hits and runs
	  scored I know its still early in the season but he and 
	  Pat Kelly more on him in a minute have provided a lot of 
	  spark at the bottom of the order thats given the big guys
	  Mattingly Tartabull ONeill plenty of RBI opportunities
	  Lets hope he keeps this up

	2Pat Kelly The guy is finally showing some of the ability
	  that led Stick Michael to label him a star for the 90s
	  I wouldnt go that far but Kelly looks infinitely improved
	  at bat I guess the tips he took from Boggs in spring training
	  really paid off Huh And here I thought Boggs would never
	  do anything to help anybody besides himself And his glove
	  like always has been terrific he and Mattingly comprise the
	  best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball IMHO

	3Paul ONeill We had to get rid of Roberto Kelly partly 
	  because he was under too much pressure in NY to be the next
	  Barry Bonds he wont do that in Cincy either and partly
	  because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up
	  in the second half of the year I just felt that we couldve
	  gotten more for him than ONeill Well so far ONeill is
	  turning out just fine He looks like he should be able to
	  duplicate if not surpass Mel Halls numbers from last year
	  and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around Tartabull
	  Now if only Buck would play him against lefties some more to 
	  see what he can do

	4Wickman A friend made a comparison between Wickman and Jack
	  Morris  they never have impressive stats but they always
	  find some way to win although Morris seems to be losing that
	  ability I figured that Wickman would be the least important
	  part of the Steve Sax trade best trade since we got that Ruth
	  guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever But I like what
	  Ive seen so far He doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job done

	5Key Whats going on here Key was just supposed to provide
	  the rotation with some stability you know shore up the left
	  side provide experience get maybe 15 wins and here this guy
	  is dominating everybody he faces Who needs Maddux or Cone 02
	  Ill take Key any day

And now the not so pleasant surprises

	1Spike Owen Sure hes hitting like crazy but the guy cannot
	  field to save his life And they said he was brought in to
	  provide defense Velarde Stankiewicz and even Silvestri
	  are better defensively than Owen

        Remember  its still early Look for his offense to tail off and his
defense to improve hopefully He has that rep because I heard that either
last year or over the last 5 years or something like that  he has the third
highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops  behind CR and
Tony Im not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all Fernandez I do agree
though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far

	2Tartabull The book on Tartabull was keep him healthy and
	  hell produce Well he hasnt done too much so far Sure hes
	  hit a few homers but those were all solo shots and he hasnt
	  gotten any of the big RBIs that your cleanup man is supposed
	  to give you Then again he had a slow start last year once he
	  got off the DL that is and turned into a oneman wrecking crew
	  late in the year so well see

	3The Bullpen UGHWhat happened We were supposed to have
	  one of the most solid pens in the majors Meanwhile the pen
	  has already blown three saves maybe more  I havent checked
	  The great HoweFarr leftyrighty tandem Farrs ERA is in the
	  20s or 30s and Howes isinfinite I didnt think such
	  a thing was possible but it is Hopefully theyll get their
	  acts together or else Bucks gonna burn out the starters
	  for fear that the bullpenll blow a lead

In the immortal words of the Scooter Holy Cow Seaver That Johnny Key
guy can pitch cant he

See you in the Series
