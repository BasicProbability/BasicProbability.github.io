Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball
brian a very distressed cardinal fan

 
NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball  Ive never seen a guy who
can waste talent like he can  One of the best rawtalent staffs in the league
and hes still finding a way to lose  Ill be surprised if he makes it through
the next 2 weeks unless drastic improvement is made
 
An even more frustrated Royals fan
