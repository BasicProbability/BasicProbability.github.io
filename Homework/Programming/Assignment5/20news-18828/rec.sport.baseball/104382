Why are the Red Sox in first place  Eight games into the season they
already have two wins each from Clemens and Viola  Clemens starts
again tonight on three days rest
 
Whats up  Are the Sox going with a fourman rotation  Is this why
Hesketh was used in relief last night

Clemens is going on his normal four days rest last pitched Saturday 
Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon his first outing
since an aborted 113 inning start 6 days before so he should be plenty
rested to go in his expected turn this Saturday as the 5th starter  Not
that this is a good thing of course  Id like to see a wellmanaged
fourman rotation with this team
