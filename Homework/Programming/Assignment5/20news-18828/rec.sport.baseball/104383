Just wondering  A friend and I were talking the other day and
we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We werent able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and

Its Stankiewicz not Stankowitz and hes not Jewish  hes Polish
by the way the correct pronunciation  according to Stanky himself
is stonKEVitch all the sportscasters get it wrong

maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help

The only other Jewish ballplayer I can think of is Ron Blomberg who is
best known as being the first DH to appear in a major league ballgame
