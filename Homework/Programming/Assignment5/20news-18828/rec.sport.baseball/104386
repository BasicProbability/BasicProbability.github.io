 This certainly passes the common sense test for me but is there any
 statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what
 percent is fielding 
 
 Not yet I wish there were  Its much more difficult to tease these apart
 than to tease apart scoring runs and preventing runs  

And thus we come to one of the true beauties of baseball these things along
with many others will never be separated Almost everything in baseball is
situational and interdependent This is what allows us to carry on all the
arguments that we have If everything could be explained and balanced on a
statistical basis none of the wonder and mystery would be left Why we might
have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself
