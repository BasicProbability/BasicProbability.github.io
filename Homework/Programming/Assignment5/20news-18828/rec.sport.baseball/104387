 Yesterday April 14th a friend and I were discussing the theory put
 forth by a local sports radio station personality that the
 Commissionerless baseball owners had snuck a live ball into this years
 baseball games in an effort to increase home run numbers and attract
 fans 

Its always possible but if this is the case I think that there is some
blatant discrimination going on here Clearly Selig is allowing the opposition
to use pre1920 baseballs against the Dodgers
   
 Well guess who stepped up to the plate for his first career grand slam
 last night against the Jays  None other than my boy  It was truly a
 sight to behold

And almost more impressive was that he also got an intentional walk
