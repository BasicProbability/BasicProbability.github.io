   Well officially its the Braves At least up until they started winning
   it was Are they still officially 
   If so why and how did they receive this label

my understanding was that ted turner owner of the braves started running
his tv station nationwide and started running all of his teams games on
his nationwide tv station he dubbed his team americas team  that is
the only team at least at the time all of whose games could be seen
across america

now wor is nationwide out of beautiful secaucus but not all mets games
are on wor  wgn chicago and wsbk boston are two other superstations
at least they are on the east coast  i dont know how many
cubssoxsox games they show
