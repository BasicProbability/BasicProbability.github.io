There is a book that you can find in sale catalogues occasionally
called Jewish Baseball Stars and baseball mavin Peter Bjarkman has
compiled a pretty definitive list of Jewish ballplayers in the bigs  

I wish I hadnt sold my copy of Jewish Baseball Stars  Its a Short Shelf
ie the one on top of the toilet tank Special  The writing in that 
books is so astonishingly awful  every sportswriting cliche taken to
the nth degree and then mangled  that its funny

Rusinow is the author I think
