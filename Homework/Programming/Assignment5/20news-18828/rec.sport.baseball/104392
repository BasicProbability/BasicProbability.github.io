Subject Re Phills vs Pirates

I hate to be the burden of bad news but I think I will this time  

The Phillies usually play at either 705 PM or 735 PM Eastern Time for
weekdays  On Sundays the time is usually 135 PM Eastern Time

Boise is in Idaho  Idaho is in part of the Mountain Time Zone and in part
of the Pacific Time Zone  The times that were given were for Mountain Time
Zone starts

Please check a map in case I am wrong  But I am certain that Boise is in the
Mountain Time Zone


Thanks for listening
