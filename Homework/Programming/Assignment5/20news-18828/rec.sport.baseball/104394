 One phrase for you YOU
 Thanks
 
 Perhaps its time to start recsportbaseballgraffiti where the kiddies
 can go yell taunts and insults at each other and leave the rest of us in
 peace

Well Sherri Id agree with you except that most kiddies have more sense than
to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults

I try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools
they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use
computers but Im telling you its gotten to the point that I dont even edit
the files anymore just read them and throw out the trash  And thanks to all
you people that think its wonderful to include a swear word or two in your
signature files thats really nice  I have to read the whole article and
then toss it out because of the sig  Dont get me wrong I know all the words you
do and Ive even made up some of my own or I wouldnt be able to edit them out 
but this just doesnt seem to be the place a public forum to spew foul language
sorry

Thanks to all you people that keep in mind there might be some decent young
people interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup  They enjoy
your articles

Phil
