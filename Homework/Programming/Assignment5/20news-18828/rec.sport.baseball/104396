   Well officially its the Braves At least up until they started winning
   it was Are they still officially 
   If so why and how did they receive this label

Probably because everyone that is everyone who has cable can watch
every Braves game They are the only team that has all of its games
broadcast nationwide And if you dont like your local team or you dont
have a local team the Braves can kind of become your local team because
you can watch them every day
