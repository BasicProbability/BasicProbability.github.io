Subject Sandberg UpdateWont be long now


Hi all you Ryno fans and those interested
Todays Chicago Tribune had this written in it today in regards to
Ryne Sandberg

Ryne Sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken
left hand and could be back in the lineup by May 1 manager Jim
Lefebvre said Friday
Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his 
gloved hand
 Im not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up said
Lefebvre   Hes a fast healer and he doesnt like being on the 
disabled list  Hes been running since he was hurt March 5 and
is in the best shape of his life  May 1 is his target date for
getting back in the lineup

Hold on to your hats Cub fansmore later as information
presents itself

Jeffery
