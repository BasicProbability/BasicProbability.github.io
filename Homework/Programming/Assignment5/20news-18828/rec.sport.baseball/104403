The Royals are darkness  They are the void of our time
When they play shame descends upon the land like a cold front
from Canada   They are a humiliation to all who have lived and
all who shall ever live   They are utterly and completely
doomed
Other than that I guess theyre OK

	Oh lighten up  What depresses me is that they might actually 
finish last which I believe hasnt happened since their second season in 
1970  Never mind that Gubizca is 02 with a 1650 ERA Gardner at 750
our main recent acquisitions Lind McReynolds Jose are averaging 210
David Cone is 02 about how he was doing in KC before joining the Mets 
several years ago our hitting sucks and our pitching has collapsed 
and weve won one game at home theyve won more games in their first ten
games than last year and Brian McRae is actually batting over the 
Mendoza line
