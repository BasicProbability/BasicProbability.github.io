  The Wizards 1988 is the second highest year ever  Still very good
but I dont like the way his numbers have declined every year  In a few
years may be a defensive liability

Thats rich Ozzie Smith a defensive liability

Why not  Brooks Robinson is a defensive liability too and Ted
Williams is a weak hitter  Even great players decline as they age
