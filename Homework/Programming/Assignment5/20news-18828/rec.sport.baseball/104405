  Is the Chicago Tribune baseball coverage any good  Does the New York Times
  have daily coverageboxscores
 
 I dont know about the Tribune but the Times has daily coverage and  
boxscores
 Of course they have special emphasis on the Yankees and Mets

Beware  The original poster looks to be from Louisville and chances are  
Louisville gets the edition of the NYTimes that is printed in Chicago for the  
MidWest  This edition has boxscores only on Monday and Sunday and an  
extremely skimpy sports section few game summaries mostly just color  
stories
