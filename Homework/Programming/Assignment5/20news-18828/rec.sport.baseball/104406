Smith Ozzie           742  717  697  672  664   0701
  The Wizards 1988 is the second highest year ever  Still very good
but I dont like the way his numbers have declined every year  In a few
years may be a defensive liability

Thats rich Ozzie Smith a defensive liability

Why  Do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until
he reaches his seventythird birthday or something  Why is it such a
strange concept that a fortyoneyearold Ozzie Smith might be a defensive
liability in 1996
