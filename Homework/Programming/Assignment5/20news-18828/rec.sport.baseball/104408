  The Wizards 1988 is the second highest year ever  Still very good
but I dont like the way his numbers have declined every year  In a few
years may be a defensive liability

Thats rich Ozzie Smith a defensive liability

Why  Do you suppose hes immune to the ravages of time  Hes 37  
In a few years hell be 40  He doesnt get to as many grounders as
he used to and will get to fewer still as his legs go as they do
on every human so far

Remember Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his
career too  Ditto Mickey Mantle  Ditto just about everyone else who 
played into their late 30s
