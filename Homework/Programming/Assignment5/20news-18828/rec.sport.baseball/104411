Whats up with Kevin Rogers of San Francisco  I thought he was slated to be
the fifth starter but hes only gotten a few relief appearences  Are they
going with four starters for now or is someone else the fifth

                                                             Thanks

Giants have a five man rotation of  John Burkett Trevor Wilson
Bill Swift Jeff Brantley and Bud BlackDave Burba  Black has
been put on the 15 day disables and Dave Burba will take his starts
