One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the
split probably somewhere around 495 and 05

 Id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 455 or
 even 4010 Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
 identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and
 even if you dont let Roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot
 more than the Oleruds by going firsttothird more often No offense
 Gordon

I wouldnt give baserunning that much value

The above effect is clear but there are other effects as well  If
Olerud hits a double any runner on first will score if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap the runner on first may need to hold
at third  Thus Oleruds doubles have more advancement value than
Alomars  Of course Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams  No
team in the 1950s ran much but some teams certainly had faster players
than others  Still the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950s for all teams  

Bill James gives the 19551958 Senators as an example  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner and in 1957 stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created
