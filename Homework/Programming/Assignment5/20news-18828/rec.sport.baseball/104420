Ive recently been working on project to determine the greatest
players at their respective postions  My sources are Total Baseball
James Historical Abstract The Ballplayers biography word of
mouth and my own biased opinions

Feel free to comment suggest flame whateverbut I tried
to be as objective as possible using statistical data not inlcuded
for timeconviences sake  I judged on Rel BA Adj OPS Total Average
fielding rangeruns total player rating Total Baseball stolen bases
for curiositys sake TPR150 g and years playedMVP

3B
 1 Mike Schmidt
 2 Ed Matthews
One t in Eddie Mathews
 3 George Brett
 4 Wade Boggs
 5 Ron Santo
 6 Brooks Robinson
 7 Frank Baker
 8 Darrell Evans
 9 Pie Traynor
10 Ray Dandridge

How can Brooks be  6  I think he would at least be ahead of Ron Santo

Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting  Their average
seasons using their combined average 656 AB  BB per 162 games

         Years  AB  H  R  2B 3B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS
Santo    1410 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 277 366 464 830
Robinson 1755 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 267 325 401 726

Fielding we have per 162 games at third

         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT
Santo    1315  149  348  30  24  954
Robinson 1772  152  350  35  15  971

Even if Robinsons extra 3 putouts 2 assists and 5 DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field that doesnt make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate not to mention the fewer
total bases  The difference of 104 in OPS should be decreased by about
025 to account for Wrigley but a 079 difference is still considerable
The Thorn  Palmer ratings are

           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total
           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating
Santo         123          284        14       137      417
Robinson      105           52         5       151      198 263
Usual disclaimers about TPs FR apply but they really shouldnt be
way off the mark in this comparison  At least its better than fielding
percentage Carney Lansford has a 966  10th best alltime but 225 FR
dead last of all time  Also since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level Robinson should be
awarded an extra 65 or so for playing 653 more games  He had a great
career but I would prefer Santos plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack
Thats a similar story Hacks far better hitting outweighs Traynors
superior fielding  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices IMHO of course though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view

CF
 7 Andre Dawson

Shouldnt that be right field
