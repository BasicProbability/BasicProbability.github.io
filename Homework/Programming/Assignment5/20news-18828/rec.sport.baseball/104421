One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the
split probably somewhere around 495 and 05

 Id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 455 or
 even 4010 Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
 identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and
 even if you dont let Roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot
 more than the Oleruds by going firsttothird more often No offense
 Gordon

I wouldnt give baserunning that much value

I meant to comment on this at the time

Theres just no way baserunning could be that important  if it was
runs created wouldnt be nearly as accurate as it is  

Runs Created is usually about 9095 accurate on a team level and
theres a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent
