Has anyone heard anything about Mel Hall this season  Id heard he wasnt
with the Yankees any more  What happened to him

				Doug Dolven

Mel is alive and well and playing in Japan The Yanks let him go because
he was asking for too much money and because they thought that they were
going to get Barry Bonds making Hall obsolete Oopsie Well at least
they got ONeill to replace the Melman
