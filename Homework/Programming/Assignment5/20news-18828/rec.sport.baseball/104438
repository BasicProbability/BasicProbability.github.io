	The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
out of nowhere to contend  The 69 Mets and 89 Orioles are prime examples
not the Cubs 

Sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent
over 162 games

I would amend your definition to

underdog  a team expected to lose but which wins thanks to underestimated
           talent

OK the Mets and Os are good examples but what about the 90 Reds  Do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the As  I know people who
didnt even think theyd win a game let alone win the Series  We proved 
them wrong though didnt we

As for this year ignore their record now  Theyve had a rocky start and
that has nothing to do with Colorado  They shall rise again  The hunt for
a Reds October continues with all due respect to WLW  Bye
