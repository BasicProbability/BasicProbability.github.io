Subject Rockies need some relief

Once again the Rockies bullpen fell apart  Andy Ashby pitched six somewhat
shaky innings giving up just one run  Then game the dreaded relief  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs one each I believe in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity  Final was 42 vs Expos

Despite their problems in the pen I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly  Going into todays game the had the leagues leading
hitter and RBI man Galarraga two of the leaders in stolen bases Young
and Cole and increasingly strong starting pitching
