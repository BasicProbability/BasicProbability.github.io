 Today Frank Viola and rest of pitcher staff of Boston Red Sox shutout Chicago
 White Sox 40  It is Red Sox 9th win of this season
 
 So far Red Sox won all the games Roger and Frank V pitched 60 and 33
 when other three starters were pitching  Tomorrow Dopson will pitch again
 have a good first start and rocky second start  I wonder that Bosox can
 play over 500 ball without Roger and Frank V
 

As long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox will
play better than 500 baseball

Or the Red Sox can hire former East German swimming coaches to
train them at the fine art of body building The Red Sox
can use Chinese women swimmers as a reference

With the HAWK the Red Sox definitely have a chance for the
east this year He brings class work ethic and leadership to
the park each day And he has a burning desire to play in the
World Series

Future HallofFamer Andre Dawson will kick butt in Boston
