	Oh lighten up  What depresses me is that they might actually 
finish last which I believe hasnt happened since their second season in 
1970
	nope The Royals are the only team in the majors that have not
     finished in last place        Of course this doesnt include 
     the marlins and the rockies but they have a good chance at 
     finishing last also
