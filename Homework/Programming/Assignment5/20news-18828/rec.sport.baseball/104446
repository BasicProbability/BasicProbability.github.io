Jack Morris starts have been like his playoff starts  He has an ERA of
1718 in his 3 starts

What does luck have to do with a 1718 ERA  He was lucky to get 21 wins
last year but he had an ERA of 404 with a team that scored a lot of
runs  I would be happy if he could still pitch with an ERA of 404 but
he seems to be suffering from a total callapse  

Bad pitchers are more prone to this total collapse than good pitchers
They are closer to the chasm of mediocrity  The smallest push and
they completely lose their grip

     But good ones can collapse somewhat then come back the next year
Burleigh Grimes went from 20 wins and an ERA of 3 or so in 24 to 1319 and
an ERA around 4 in 25  He pitched well for several more years  Carlton
won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 2710 record Source Bill James

     And lets not forget John Tudor who started 15 and finished 216 in
1985  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at
the start of the season

He gave up early runs
in his 92 games and would get stronger as the game went on thus giving
up few runs in the last going  He stays in the game and gets the win
How else would he have pitched so many innings

Yup  He used to dig himself a hole then get it together and stick in
until the run support eventually came through  This year he just
hasnt gotten it together

     If I recall he had a 450 ERA in the 1st half and a 350 ERA in the
2nd half of last year  
     Hmmm 21 runs in 11 innings  Suppose he starts 30 more games and winds
up w200 innings pitched  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
innings hell have a 475 ERA or so at the end of the year I think I have
his totals right This is going to be hard to come back from

Jack may be finished  It is time to retire or be released if he does
not return to his form from last year

His 5 million contract is an awful lot to eat

     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone  My 2nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts
Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL  Or will Danny Cox who went 3 or 4
scoreless innings against the Tribe today start for Morris  He looks like
a really good one  Gaston is scrambling to find starters Id imagine
Luckily the Jays have a very good offense
     I dont think they would dare release him before the end of the year
Hell just be replaced by Stewart or Cox
