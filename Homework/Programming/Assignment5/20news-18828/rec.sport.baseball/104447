Subject Reds snap 5game losing streak RedReport 418

Kevin Mitchells sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 23 comefrombehind victory over 
New York Hernandez ran for pinchhitter Cecil Espy who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right moved to second on Bob Kellys infield sneaker
down the thirdbase line and to third on Jeff Bransons wellplaced bunta 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense

Cincinnati trailed 20 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings a fourthinning leadoff double
by Vince Coleman  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short  Orselak was pinchhitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kelloggs inside strike by drawing the line really he
should know better than that  Murray and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed

The Mets fifth started with a Howard Johnsons firstpitch homer  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kents
single then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was surprise misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple Catcher Hundleys grounder to the drawnin Branson
failed to bring Thompson in then the play of the game occured

Saberhagen was due up so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze  They called it perfectly
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pughs firstpitch pitch out and the threat ended
Isnt the NATIONAL LEAGUE great

The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game  After Barry Larkins
ground out Mitchell Chris Sabo and Randy Milligan got backtobacktoback
singlesthe third scoring Mitchell  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too lateWilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonillas threerun dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cincis season  Bonilla ended
up walking and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities  The win went
to Steve Foster 12 who got in what must be an egoboosting two perfect innings
work striking out three  Saberhagen 21 got the lossthough Im a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth  Ill take it though

The Reds are now 39 still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today  The Mets are 65
