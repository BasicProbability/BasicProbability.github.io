   	The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
   out of nowhere to contend  The 69 Mets and 89 Orioles are prime examples
   not the Cubs 

   Sorry but it is virtually impossible to win a division with no talent
   over 162 games

Well with players certainly  However it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent  Cf Blue Jays 1992
