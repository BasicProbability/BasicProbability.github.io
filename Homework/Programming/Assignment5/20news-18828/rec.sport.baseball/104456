    What position does Mike Lansing play  I cannot seem to find it 
  anywhere  Thanks1

Currently hes all over  He played 2nd when Deshields was out  He was
shifted to third when Delino came back  And today he played SS for a cold
Wil Cordero  

His natural positions seem to be in the middle infield but they will seemingly
find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot

                                                                  P Tierney
