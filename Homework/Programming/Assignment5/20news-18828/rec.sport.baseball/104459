Has Jack lost a bit of his edge What is the worst start Jack Morris has had

Uh Jack lost his edge about 5 years ago and has had only one above
average year in the last 5

Again goes to prove that it is better to be good than lucky  You can
count on good tomorrow  Lucky seems to be prone to bad starts and a
bad finish last year 

Yes I am enjoying every last run he gives up  Who was it who said
Morris was a better signing than Viola

Cheers
Valentine

Hey Valentine I dont see Boston with any world series rings on their
fingers  Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
future  Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best 
signing  And dont tell me Boston will win this year  They wont 
even be in the top 4 in the division more like 6th
