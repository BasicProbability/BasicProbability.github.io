Later in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter  What the Helll
is he thinking

If memory serves me well Alicea hit it and damn near tied the game
Torre obviously knows his players better than you do 


See yall at the ballyard
