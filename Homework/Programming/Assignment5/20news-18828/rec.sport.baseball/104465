Subject Militello update

HEY All you Yankee fans whove been knocking my prediction of Baltimore
You flooded my mailbox with cries of Militellos good Militellos good

Where is he I noticed he got skipped over after that oh so strong first
outing  Hes not by any chance in Columbus  now is he  Please dont tell
me youre relying on this guy to be the fourth not the fifth but the 
fourth starter on this brittle pitching staff  

As for the Os its still early


See yall at the ballyard
Go Braves
