 I do not read Klapischs news columns regularly but I
 do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator
 that enjoys hopefully for only professional reasons to drumb
 up a news story even if there isnt one there  Now as far as
 the confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago I almost
 totally blame Bonilla  No matter what a member of the press
 does and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might
 be that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a
 journalist  

Bonilla wasnt threatening anyone  He just wanted to give him the dollar 
tour
