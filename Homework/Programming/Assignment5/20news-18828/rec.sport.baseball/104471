From  Austin Jacobs
Subject BOB KNEPPER WAS DAMN RIGHT

Dont you GUYS think so  I mean cmon  What the heck are women doing
even THINKING of getting into baseball  They cause so many problems  Just
look at Lisa Olson  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New
England Patriots locker room  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL  I
just dont think women belong in a mans sport  Before you smart guys
flame me for this I know the given example was about football  Who cares
 It still applies to other MALE sports  How can we have women umpires 
Jeez  Look at Pam Postema  Just because shes a woman everybody on the
face of the earth thinks its great that shes getting an opportunity to
ump  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of
roast beef youd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires
Besides she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a
foul tip off of Wade Boggs bat Or Jose Oquendos bat Either way there
are too many complications
