So far Simmons looks like a total idiot

5 Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation I
cant understand his and managements fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers Even if they do whats the use He is aright hander like Slaught
Not a very smart platoon Also I am blaming Leyland in this case since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffsSLaught
should have played in all 7 games he has a good average against right handed
pitching Didnt Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasnt very fit last year

Sorry but this is the biggest load of bunk Ive seen in a while 
a The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now
Nobody was even vaguely interested
b Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince
who was out of options
c LaVallieres release had nothing to do with him being through He
was released because in the event of an injury to Slaught
LaValliere is no longer capable they believe of being the everyday
catcher

Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties
the offense should actually improve with this move
