HEY All you Yankee fans whove been knocking my prediction of Baltimore
You flooded my mailbox with cries of Militellos good Militellos good

Where is he I noticed he got skipped over after that oh so strong first
outing

About as good as Mussinas better than Sutcliffes and McDonalds

  Hes not by any chance in Columbus  now is he 
Hes in the bullpen Steinbrenner is in charge after all

 Please dont tell
me youre relying on this guy to be the fourth not the fifth but the 
fourth starter on this brittle pitching staff  

Hes got the talent to be the 4th starter now and evetually the ace
He was a higher ranked and generally better prospect than Arthur
Rhodes who happens to be well hey the Orioles 4th starter


As for the Os its still early

As for Militello its still early
