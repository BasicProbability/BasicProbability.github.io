 Isnt it funny that  a white person calls comeone a nigger and gets banned 
 for a year but a black person calls someone a faggot and there is no 
 consequence

Ted youre missing a vital point  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices  Bonilla
on the other hand was found to have mentioned this one word a single time
 If he had been known to go around criticizing homosexuals it would be a
different story  Furthermore he is merely an athlete  He doesnt have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do  Dave Pallone the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea  He like you thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball  Pallone is hoping for a years suspension  In my opinion
thats downright ludicrous  As Howie Rose on WFAN said if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions then youd probably have enough people remaining
to play a threeonthree game  Now honestly if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article I
would think that youd reconsider your thoughts
