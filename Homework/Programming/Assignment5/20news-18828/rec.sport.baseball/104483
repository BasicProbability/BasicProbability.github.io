I try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary       
schools
they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use
computers but Im telling you its gotten to the point that I dont even
edit
the files anymore just read them and throw out the trash  And thanks to
all

signature files thats really nice  I have to read the whole article and
then toss it out because of the sig
