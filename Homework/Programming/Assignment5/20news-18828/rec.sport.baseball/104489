Hey Valentine I dont see Boston with any world series rings on their
fingers

Yah  So

Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
future

He certainly didnt earn his last one  HOW many games did he blow
in the World Series  All of the ones he started

Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best signing

Oh yes  Definitely  Therefore Morris is better than Clemens

Dont give me that shit  If Boston had Alomar Olerud Henke and
Ward while Toronto had Rivera Jack Clark Jeff Reardon things would
have looked a little different last fall  Give credit where credit is
due  This lavishing of praise on Morris makes me sick

And dont tell me Boston will win this year  They wont 
even be in the top 4 in the division more like 6th

Im willing to bet they dont finish sixth  Im also willing to bet
they dont finish first  And if you give me 32 odds Im willing to
bet that they finish ahead of the Blue Jays

Valentine
