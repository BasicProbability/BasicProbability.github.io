the only really valid retort to Valentine is werent the Red Sox trying
to get Morris too oh sure they said Viola was their first choice
afterwards but what should we have expected they would say

Lou wanted Morris all along  The idiot  Giving the man 40 million
to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the
safety off  The only question is how many shots he will get off
before somebody is wise enough to take it away

 And dont tell me Boston will win this year  They wont 
 even be in the top 4 in the division more like 6th

if this is true it wont be for lack of contribution by Viola so who cares

I dont see why people expect Boston to finish sixth  The bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied  Boston in seventh place had
73 wins  The Yankees and Indians tied for fourth place had 76 wins

Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than
the Indians or Tigers  Basically the Red Sox are stronger this year
at 1B DH SS LF and RF  They have healthier starting pitchers so
far at least and better relievers  I see no reason why they
shouldnt win 85 games  Meanwhile the Indians are in shambles and
the Tigers still have no pitching  They will win some 203
blowouts but they will lose an awful lot of 75 games too

MAYBE the Sox will play poorly win 78 games and finish fifth
But I think third or fourth place is more likely

Cheers
Valentine
