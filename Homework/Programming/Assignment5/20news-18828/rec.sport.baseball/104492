Why did I get sucked into this

Dont you GUYS think so  I mean cmon  What the heck are women doing
even THINKING of getting into baseball  They cause so many problems  Just

Assuming youre serious I guess youd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS dont think so I would guess that a tiny fraction
of 1 of the folks reading your post agree with it I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it

Im not going to go through your points one at a time because 
after all not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball

Im only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema the
AAA umpire who sued is suing baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she wasnt promoted to the majors

Jeez  Look at Pam Postema  Just because shes a woman everybody on the
face of the earth thinks its great that shes getting an opportunity to
ump  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of
roast beef youd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires

Ive never seen her ump a game I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire

But I have seen her on talk shows And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if thats how she sees
the role of umpires in the game well I wouldnt promote her
either

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out hell Joe Lundy could do that Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game keep the game moving and keep the
players from trying to kill each other 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people That disqualifies most
of us both men and women And if Ms Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook then I think that disqualifies her as well Umpires
need to command the game command of the rulebook is secondary
