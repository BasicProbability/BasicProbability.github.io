So far Simmons looks like a total idiot

Whatever you say  I think its just 12 games into the season myself so
Im going to wait a bit before calling names

2 I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week Now Ottos latest debacle has restored Simmons
reputation Now he looks like he is back in his 92 form when he had the
ALs highest ERA among starters Four our sakenot Teds sake I hope he
pitches with a 35 ERA for the rest of the season Yeah right

I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him  On the other hand I expect him to
release Otto if he doesnt turn things around pretty fast  BTW
Ottos game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22 which points out
a problem with the method since Ottos performance was infinitely bad
and excruciatingly prolonged

3 Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing They are still doing decently
But considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse 

I think Merceds rookie year was a bit flukey but arent you willing to
give him some more at bats and Tomlin a few more starts before acting
so gloomy

4 Walk Well he seems to be on the losing end tonight BUt I still think 
that Walk desrved his contract

No he didnt  Walk is a time bomb  He has no stuff whatsoever and when
the league finally realizes this it wont be pretty at all

8 The Rookie batters Well Young has surprised me a bit with his
instant impact Other than that their excellent performance hasnt
been too much of a surprise I think we should thank Doughty for that

Dont be so fast  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors
Meanwhile Im not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
sixyear free agent before the 1992 season

9 Rookie Pitchers Worse than expected especially Cooke

Twice through the rotation and youve given up  Yikes

10 Slaught How come he wasnt given a contract extension last year 
Now his value has increased immensely

But so has his age at least in baseball terms  The useful halflife
of a 34 yearold injuryprone catcher cant be much longer than a year

11 Lonnie Smith Well Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount

But he wanted to be a Dodger and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992  I dont think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him

Lets see Eric can hit better He can run better He can field better
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith 

He certainly wasnt last year

Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this yearhe wont be an asset 
He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field

Hey thats the Skates Smith package deal  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or baserunning particularly at this stage is
a real weirdo

12 Management BIG BIG ZERO Sauer has yet to make a forceful argument
in favor of revenue sharing He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay

If thats the goal of the team ownership than I dont see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy  I dont know what he has or
hasnt said about revenue sharing so I cant comment there

13 Alex Cole fiasco 
 stuff deleted
Ironically the biggest accomplishment of Simmons tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap Too bad that he gave him away in the
expansion draft

Its annoying but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King it was probably unavoidable  Meanwhile I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year drafting well in 1992 letting the rookies show something
in 1993  Foley Smith and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts which means that even if fail it hasnt done serious damage to
the Bucs future

14 Compensatory draft picks for Bonds Forget it The pirates can rant 
and rave they will not get those picks As of now the issue is still 
being appealed

Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case  I
never heard the outcome of this  When will the final verdict be in on
this

Now if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots
nothing else will

Im not sure who was the idiot in this case so I dont know who to
blame  It might have been Doug Danforth after all  In fact I
seriously suspect it was Doug Danforth who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet

btwIve wondered whether my latest posts have been getting
offsite so if somebody known to impersonate ee cummings can see
this would he drop me a short note
