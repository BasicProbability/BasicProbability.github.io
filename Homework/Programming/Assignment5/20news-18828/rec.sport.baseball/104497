 I would like to make everyone aware that in winning the NL West the Atlanta
 Braves did not lead wiretowire  Through games of 41493 the Houston
 Astros are percentage points ahead of the unbeatable Braves

And they deserve to be if for no other reason than salvaging a little of the
honor of the NL West The supposed strongest division in baseball lost 6 of 7
to the East yesterday with only the Astros prevailing
