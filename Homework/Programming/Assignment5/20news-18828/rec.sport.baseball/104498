We wont really be able to say anything for at least another couple of
weeks  But so far it looks like a homerific season  Might the umps
be squeezing the strike zone



Watching the Braves on TBS I would have said that the strike zone
in the NL has expanded this season  Specifically it appears that
the strike zone has moved above the belt  Yeah the announcers
have commented on that also but it was also my perception

However the strike zone hasnt climbed all the way up to
the letters  Its more like a little ways under the letters

Any other perceptions out there

Judging by the way the Reds pitchers have performed thus far it
appears to me that the zone has been squeezed to the size of a grape
