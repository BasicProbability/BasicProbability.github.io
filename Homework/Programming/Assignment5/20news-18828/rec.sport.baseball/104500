	1Spike Owen Sure hes hitting like crazy but the guy cannot
	  field to save his life And they said he was brought in to
	  provide defense Velarde Stankiewicz and even Silvestri
	  are better defensively than Owen

Remember  its still early Look for his offense to tail off and
his defense to improve hopefully He has that rep because I heard
that either last year or over the last 5 years or something like
that  he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league
shortstops  behind CR and Tony Im not gonna help this sorry Mets
team at all Fernandez I do agree though that he has not looked all
that impressive in the field thus far

Owen only has one error so far I believe  That seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches  He will have a fine
fielding percentage like always  The problem is that he doesnt
reach anything that isnt hit straight at him

This wouldnt be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura  But the third baseman for the Yankees
is Wade Boggs who should have moved across the diamond last year

Ive only seen one game Abbotts first start but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott
