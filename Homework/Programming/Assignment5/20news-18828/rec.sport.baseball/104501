or second starter  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound the other teams score less runs  The team that scores the most 
runs wins  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves 

Not clear to me at all  Id certainly rather have a team who was winning
41 games than 21 games  In the 21 game luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the 41 game
