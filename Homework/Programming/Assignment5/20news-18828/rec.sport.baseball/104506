 Some pleasant and then some not so pleasant surprises about the 1993
 edition of the Bronx Bombers so far
 
 	4Wickman A friend made a comparison between Wickman and Jack
 	  Morris  they never have impressive stats but they always
 	  find some way to win although Morris seems to be losing that
 	  ability I figured that Wickman would be the least important
 	  part of the Steve Sax trade best trade since we got that Ruth
 	  guy maybe winding up as a good middle reliever But I like  
what
 	  Ive seen so far He doesnt pitch pretty but he gets the job  
done
 



     Actually I kind of liked the Abott trade We did trade the rookie of  
the year SNOW but with Don mattingly at first for another 8 years Why  
bother
