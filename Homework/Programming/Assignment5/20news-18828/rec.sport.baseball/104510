Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME

In article 1993Apr150932315148newsyaleedu  Steve Tomassi writes
     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Dont you think he deserves it
I mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as is Lee Smith ha then why dont we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell
Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon

	Oh yeah  Dave Winfieldmarginal player  Guy didnt hit a lick had
negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power  Dave Winfield
now entering his I believe 20th big league season is still a damn decent
hitter  Admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime
he had a powerful arm and great range  Take a look at the stats  I dont 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players  Kingman was a onedimension power hitterhe couldnt field
he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if I remember right his
OBP wasnt THAT hideous and for those who consider such things important
was a absoluteprimodick  
	Eddie Murray  Yup only the best 1st baseman of the 80s  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in 1983 it seems that he wasnt overrated by the media  
	Lee Smith  Hmmmm This ones actually pretty close  Hes had a s
solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
Wrigley Fenway  Id have to take a closer look at the stats its been 
a while but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers
simply racking up a lot of saves doesnt mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch too  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and for a month
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF IMHO
	Darrell Evans  Nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like
Ted Simmons IMHO but not a HOFer

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards
marginal

	Lemme ask you this  Who the hell playing the game ISNT marginal

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there Theyre both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal
Lets be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors so
liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if something

	Now wait a goddamn minute here  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop  His defense was SO good that hes won something along
the lines of 10 Gold Gloves  Again Gold Gloves are mediotbiased and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzies more
recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early
80s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career  Ozzies
offense you ask  Good OBP great speed numbers in a park which for most of his
career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against Tom Niedenfuer
 but still a definite asset offensively
	Yount  3000 hits MVP at two different positions uhhuh a real
stiff  His 82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks as far as
SS numbers go  Hes a clear HOFer IMHO

isnt done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When 
certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential 
candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

	Well as far as Garvey goes youre right  Garvey is a mediot 
candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one
at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of
a tree stump  Garvey shouldnt be in the HOF
	SkyJack  Ive said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris ability to win which is nothing more than Morris ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs  At this point Morris is an
average pitcher although from his early returns in 93 he may be damned 
close to done  But in all fairness Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80s for upanddown Tiger teams  While 1984 was obviously a great year
for Detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but
not favorites  Morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of HOF
consideration  
	Ryan  Of course but be careful  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time  After all Nolan never won a Cy  Damn hes 
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years  His WL record is mediocre
Of course Nolans a HOFer
	Puck  Probably although hes got to play reasonably well for a few
more years 10 years even good ones arent enough to make the HOF most
likely  That said I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden  Hes very popular in the media and with fans and
legitimately has been one of the best CFs in the game since he joined the
league  Ive always liked the guy and I hope he does make it  And in the
end I think the Puck will make it in  But really its too early to sell

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it 
or not I never tire of it  Its an interesting subject  Heres an off
the top of my head list of potential HOFers from each team  I probably
left a couple of guys off so feel free to follow up  I wont consider ANYONE
who started playing after about 1985 again too early to tell Note these
are all active players Im not counting recent retirees

Baltimore  Cal Ripken should be a lock by now even if Gehrigs record stands
Boston Roger Clemens might be a lock already which is amazing Dawson 
Detroit Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker possibilities
Milwaukee Robin Yount discussed earlier
New York Wade Boggs possibly Mattingly long shot
Toronto Paul Molitor and Jack Morris possibilities

Kansas City George Brett lock
Minnesota Kirby too early to tell Winfield lock
Oakland Eckersley lock McGwire too early Rickey lock Welch LONG shot
Texas The Mighty Nolan Too early to consider Canseco or Strange 

Cubs Sandberg lock
St Louis Ozzie lock Lee Smith probably
New York Murray almost a lock Saberhagen obviously hes got to regain
				  	      past form
And most certainly NOT Vince Coleman despite what hell tell you 

Los Angeles Butler Strawberry and Hershiser are all long shots
San Diego Tony Gwynn pretty good shot
Colorado Dale Murphy a good shot Ryan Bowen just to see if youre awake

	Before I get flames this is an offthetopofthehead list theres
probably a few deserving candidates that I left off and I didnt include
Barry Bonds Will Clark Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher Frank Thomas Canseco
McGriff etc because I only considered guys who started playing before
1985

	Email or post I almost fear what I may have started here


Bruce Hasch                haschjhuvmshcfjhuedu        Sell the team Eli
