Heres my analysis of Jose Canseco circa Sep 92 and Jose Canseco
circa June 1986

1  Hes bulked up too much  Period  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds
    not gain more bulk

Ive been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the As conditioning
guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his backAlthough I dont for one second believe Jose used steroidshis
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their framesee Jeff
Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example and IMHO Jose is too big for his
frame


2  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED  Conservatively Id say hes
    lost 47 of his bat speed and thats a HUGE amount of speed

I cant imagine how to estimate bat speed but its pretty obvious that
Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit likely due to his back


3  That open stance is KILLING him   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is
    released  Downing could do this without significant head movement 
    Canseco cant  Also note that Canseco doesnt always close his
    stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes
    theyre fully closed  Without a good starting point its hard
    to make adjustments in your swing

I dont know he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the As and had no problems with it then It might be that preback
problems he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused but now hes lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him The old saying if youre hot its a trigger mechanism if youre
cold its a hitch 

First minimize movement before the swing  Close and widen the stance
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing  Hopefully this
will cut down on the time I need to swing and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely

The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance hes comfortable
with for more than a few months He changes his stance so much he loses
track of where the strike zone is In Wednesdays night game he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
hes changed his stance so much

Im also a bit concerned that because hes got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns hell become competitive swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse LaRussa always said that Cansecos famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits
