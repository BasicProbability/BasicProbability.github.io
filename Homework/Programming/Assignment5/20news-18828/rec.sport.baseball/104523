 I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauchs
 ineptitude in managing the pitching staff  Down the stretch he
 abused Jim Bunning Chris Short and Robin Roberts I think those
 are the three pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some
 time  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season
 obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm  Oh
 well

Roberts was long gone  he was probably an Oriole in 1964  Or maybe a
Colt 45  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey the previous years ace
Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter

They were indeed 65 up with 12 to go but they won their final two
games after the horrid 10loss streak  The final game victory
Bunnings 19th win if memory serves kept the Reds from tying for the
title they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards with the
Giants another game back  The Mets couldnt hold an early lead
against the Cards that final Sunday or there would have been a 3way
tie  Too bad they couldnt have saved some of the 15 or so runs they
scored on Saturday when they crushed St Louis
