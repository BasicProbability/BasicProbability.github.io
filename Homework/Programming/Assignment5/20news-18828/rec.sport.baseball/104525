NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball

I havent seen enough Royals games to judge his tactics so you may have
a point here  But

Ive never seen a guy who can waste talent like he can  One of the best
rawtalent staffs in the league and hes still finding a way to lose

IMO the Royals dont have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae
suddenly began channeling for John McGraw  OK they have some decent
pitchers  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind
and McReynolds and McRae and an overthehill Brett youre not going
to finish 500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him

Id say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck
