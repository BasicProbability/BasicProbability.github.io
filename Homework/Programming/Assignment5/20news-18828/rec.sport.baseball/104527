Does any one out there listen to WFAN  For those of you who do
not know what I am talking about it is an all sports radio
staion in New York  On a clear night the signal reaches up and
down the East coast  In particular I want to know how Len
Berman and Mike Lupicas show is  I go to school in Virginia
so I cant listen when there are on during the day  Just
wondering

Youre right about the signal being strong I live in West Philadelphia
and I can get FAN almost perfectly Its a sports fans dream especially
if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while hes
away at school As for Lupica  Berman its turned out to be Lupica
then Berman Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show so Ed
Coleman and Dave Sims old fourhour slot was broken down into two
seperate twohour show  Lupica from 1012 and Berman from 122 And they
both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave  COME BACK GUYS


The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station but doesnt come close to
the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio 610 WIP in Philadelphia  The signal
might not be as powerful but then again only stations in New York
feel obligated to pollute everyone elses airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day  WIP took two of your
best sports jockeys too Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks  610
WIP is rockin with sports talk from 530 AM till midnight check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia  If Im not
mistaken WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation


Like I said I live in Philly so I can hear FAN andor WIP whenever I
want But I cannot stand WIP And it isnt because I loathe the Philly
sports teams  the Phillies are my favorite NL team Yanks are favorite
AL and the Eagles arent too bad either There are two big problems

	1Total emphasis on the home teams especially the Eagles Unlike
	  the FAN hosts who can at least answer a question about an
	  outoftown team if a caller asks the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesnt play on
	  Broad Street Also FANs periodic sports updates every 20
	  minutes gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country Its very rare to hear an outoftown score
	  being reported on WIP

	2The hosts With the exception of Jody MacDonald who I miss
	  from his days at FAN none of the hosts really seems to have
	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good onair presence
	  The worst is Gary Cobb who seems to have been hired solely
	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles

Anyway thats my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle
