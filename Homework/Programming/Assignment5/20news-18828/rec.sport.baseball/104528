  Guess which line is which
  	BA	OBP	SLG	AB	H	2B	3B	HR	BB
  X	310	405	427	571	177	27	8	8	87
  Y	312	354	455	657	205	32	1	20	35


I just love how the Alomar fans left RBIs off this list  Give me a break

  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
on the team To a large extent If Frank Thomas hit first hed lose a LOT
of RBIs and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive
in 100 runs Doesnt happen that oftenvery unlikely with Devon Whites
300 OBP in front of you
