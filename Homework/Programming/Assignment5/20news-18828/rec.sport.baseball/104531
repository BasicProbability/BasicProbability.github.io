From texdudecs1bradleyedu Philip Allen
Subject Ryan rumor

This just in

Nolan Ryan hurt his right knee in the 4th inning of the RangersOrioles
game last night  Hell be having arthoscopic surgery that will at best
keep him on the DL for two to five weeks

Just when I had almost convinced myself that the Rangers rotation would
stay healthy this year
