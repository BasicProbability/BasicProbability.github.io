I feel as if I might be causing some bad karma by doing this but I just have
to know
 
Is the Ack man still in organized baseball 

	Glad you asked  The Ackman and nine of his relatives are currently
impersonating the Baltimore Orioles pitching staff  Personally I believe 
that the Evil Ackers kidnapped the real Os staff and are currently in the
process of impersonating Mussina Sutcliffe McDonald Olson 

	No no no The Ack man is apparently an alien lifeform much
like the pod people from planet Mars who can take on any form the
ability remains the same however The Ackpeople have been spotted on
many teams to date but it appears that the Orioles staff mentioned
above and the Expos bullpen Barnes Walton Fassero Gardiner and
Rojas have been the prime target Apparently John Wetteland was roughed
up by the Ackpeople during spring training due to the fact that his
system rejected the takeover and has been on the DL ever since Contact
the authorities This evil plot must be stopped the Ackpeople can
keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman though I enjoy watching Toronto fans
suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal
