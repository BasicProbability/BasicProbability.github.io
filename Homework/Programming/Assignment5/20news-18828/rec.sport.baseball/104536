Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball
brian a very distressed cardinal fan
NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball  Ive never seen a guy who
can waste talent like he can  One of the best rawtalent staffs in the league
and hes still finding a way to lose  Ill be surprised if he makes it through
the next 2 weeks unless drastic improvement is made
 
KC news was doing a report on that  They said that McRae is
really a batting coach and not a manager  But for some reason
he took the job  Whatever the reason the Royals need a new
manager nowwhile it is too late
