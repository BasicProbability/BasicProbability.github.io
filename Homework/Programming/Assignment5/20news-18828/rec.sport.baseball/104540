second basemen in history He probably didnt even have as good a season as
Alomar last year

Guess which line is which
	BA	OBP	SLG	AB	H	2B	3B	HR	BB
X	310	405	427	571	177	27	8	8	87
Y	312	354	455	657	205	32	1	20	35

The walks should give it away  OBPs in general somewhat more valuable than
slugging and Alomars edge in OBP was quite a bit larger than Baergas edge
in slugging

Im no SDCN but whats more valuable

28 hits w5 more doubles 12 more HRs   OR
7 more triples and 52 BBs  Lets not forget the 39 extra SBs How many CS

Of course the 28 hits and 12 homers are more valuable

But dont forget the 58 outs  You cant have it both ways Baergas higher
raw numbers are due to him having more playing time and thus he had more
hits and homers but dont forget the cost of those outs

BTW just to answer your question Alomar had 49 SB and 9 CS Baerga had
10 SB and 2 CS which gives a minute plus on Alomars side

Something else to consider

Alomars HR splits were 500363 SLG 444369 OBP Baergas was 486424
and 392318 Pretty clearly Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park

Id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now TP
rated Baerga higher actually
