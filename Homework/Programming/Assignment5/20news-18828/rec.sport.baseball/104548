 reference to history because he certainly didnt have the best season for    
 second basemen in history He probably didnt even have as good a season as
 Alomar last year
   
 What  Do you have some measure like popularity in Toronto doesnt count
 that you are basing this statement on
 
 Uh yes  Baerga has a lot of flash but Alomar was the better hitter
 last year
 
 BATTERS        BA   SLG   OBP   G  AB   R   H  TB 2B 3B HR RBI  BB  SO SB CS  E

 ALOMARR     310  427  405 152 571 105 177 244 27  8  8  76  87  52 49  9  5
 

This is fascinating  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP

 Hmmmwhat about walks and SB Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and
beat him in SLG by a lesser margin Even putting aside any other factors
a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with
a 28 point edge in SLG The issue has been studied before and I doubt you
could come up with any convincing argument the other way
 People see the batting average and the HR but they dont really know  
their value is worth unless theyve studied the issue closely The fact is that
Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar while Baerga was making outs
Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter Winfield etal
