     Actually I kind of liked the Abott trade We did trade the rookie of  
the year SNOW but with Don mattingly at first for another 8 years Why  
bother

Id be willing to make two wagers
1 Snow doesnt win ROY
2 Mattingly is out of baseball within five years

Im skeptical of the first because I dont think Snow is that good a
player and he is on a losing team

Im skeptical of the second because of his back  Mattingly is 32 this
year and how many players play until they are 40  Not too many and
most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 32

Could be wrong on either or both but I think thats the smart way to
bet

Cheers
