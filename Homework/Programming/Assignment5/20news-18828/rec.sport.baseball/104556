My point RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is And no stat or lack
of can tell me there are no clutch hitters Maybe no stat CAN tell me
either but some people are I just know it 8

I was hoping somebody would mention clutch  Clutch  Baerga  The
two words simply do not go together  With runners in scoring
position Baerga batted 308366418 last year  This doesnt quite
suck but most batters hit better in this situation

Alomar  He hit 354439517 with runners in scoring position

The difference  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB  Baerga had 81
RBIs in 182 such AB  Baerga got 25 more chances yet succeeded only
20 more times

Frankly I dont believe in clutch  But if I did my vote would
go to Alomar for MVP let alone best 2B in the AL
