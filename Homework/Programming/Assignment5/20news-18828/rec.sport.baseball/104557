Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME

Steve Tomassi writes


     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Dont you think he deserves it
I
mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as
is Lee Smith ha then why dont we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell
Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie
Murray and Jeff Reardon

Unfortunately you seem to lack the ability to rate players  Dave
Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of
Fame  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players
of all time  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since 1960 with the possible exception of Gossage

On the other hand Kingman probably isnt one of the best 750 players
of all time

And Reardon though a good pitcher isnt in Smiths class career wise

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving
Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards
marginal

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there Theyre both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal

Were talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here  There probably
arent 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two

     Lets be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
so
liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if
something
isnt done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When
certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
candidates the absurdity is apparent

Garvey sucked  Morris while a very good pitcher simply doesnt
belong near Cooperstown

 Gee can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

If Puckett and Ryan okay no if there get into to the Hall they will be 
marginal Hall of Famers unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer

To put this in perspective heres a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention  In parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it
While no one would claim these are perfect rankings they should give
you a good value of these guys careers as compared to average players

Robin Yount 430 41
Ozzie Smith 421 45
Dave Winfield 403 53
Eddie Murray 375 68
Darrel Evans 352 80
Kirby Puckett 243 180
Nolan Ryan 216 219
Jack Morris 118 478
Dave Kingman 04 
Steve Garvey 58

To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall
Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 350 64 are in the Hall
of Fame The ones who arent include 4 19th century players Ron Santo Bobby
Grich and Bob Johnson

Of those eligible who score between 300 and 349 15 of 25 are in  Of
those eligible who score between 250 and 299 24 of 44 are in
