Subject Re Phillies A New Ballpark in Future

In a Philadelphia Inquirer a few days ago it was reported that there were
two 2 plans for a new Phillies stadium  the alreadymentioned 30th
Street Station proposal and a location near Broad Street and Race Street
I think  I cant remember the exact details but the stadium would be
build practically downtown  There is a small lot that could be used
according to the paper  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble
because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to
accomodate the stadium  I dont have an opinion just yet just letting
everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now
Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon however because
nobody wants to pay for it
