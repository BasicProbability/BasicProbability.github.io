Subject Re The 1964 Phillies deja vu

Previously I wrote

Yeah the Phillies played over their heads almost the whole year
but it all caught up to them in one 10game streak I am as old as
1964 man and I was a big Phillies fan at the time age 13
September 64 is still a painful thing to remember But I can tell you
that the Phillies never led the league by 15 that year Going by memory
alone I believe their biggest lead was 7 12 games and they were
6 12 ahead when the famous 10game losing streak began a streak
during which it seemed that they found just about every way to lose
known to man Anyway I think they rebounded just before the end and
won their last couple games and were still in the thing until the
final day but finished tied with the Giants one game out And didnt
the Dodgers or somebody else finish two games back That has to be
one of the closest last minute scrambles ever

OK you guys stirred up my childhood memories so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate at least as
far as the Phillies record goes On September 1 1964 this was the
top of the NL standings

                 W     L    GB
Philadelphia    79    51    
Cincinnati      74    57    5 12
St Louis       72    59    7 12
San Francisco   73    60    7 12

This is a gamebygame description of the remainder of the Phillies
season

            Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals

Well so far so good for the Phillies But now it all falls apart 

921  01   Cincinnati      5 12     Mahaffey 129
            Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place

925 5712 Milwaukee       1 12     Short Boozer 34
            Cards now 2 12 back in 3rd Giants 3 12 in 4th

            Phils lose 7 12 games in 7 days Reds take over 1st
             Cardinals 1 12 back in 3rd

929  24   St Louis      1 12     Bennett 1214
            Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st
930  58   St Louis      2 12     Bunning 188
            Cardinals take 12 game lead over Reds
101  43   Cincinnati     1 12     Short Roebuck 53
            Phillies halt 10game losing streak Cards lead Reds by 12 game
102  Did not play Cards lose to Mets Reds tied for 1st Phils 1 game back
103  100  Cincinnati     1         Bunning 198
            Cards beat Mets take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies

Whew what a finish And the final standings were

                 W     L    GB
St Louis       93    69    
Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesnt appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused at least by the fourman rotation standard of
the day until well along into the 10game losing streak at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 100 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant Bunning pitched
a complete game sixhitter striking out five and walking one It
would be inetersting to see though how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1 while they didnt play substantially more games than
the other teams the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch
