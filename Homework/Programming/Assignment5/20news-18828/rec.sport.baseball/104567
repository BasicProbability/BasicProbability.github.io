I would email this to you but my mailserver doesnt recognize you or
something

Anyway the worst pitcher on the Yanks If you mean currently on the team
then I have to go with Scott Im a schizophrenicNo Im NOT
Kamienicki Sure occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings
but then he starts to go insane A sure sign that hes losing his stuff
and his mind is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters
and yell at himself

The worst alltime Yanks pitcher  Gotta go with Ed New York I have to
pitch in gulp New York Whitson Nuff said


Im outta here like Vladimir
