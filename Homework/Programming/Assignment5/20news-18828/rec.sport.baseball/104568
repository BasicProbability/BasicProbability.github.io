Subject Re Sandberg Runs RBIs was Re Notes on Jays vs Indians Series

In article C5JqByM7Anewsrichbnrca brattcrchh7a9NoSubdomainNoDomain John Bratt writes
RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  You
can talk about OBP and SLG all you want but the fact remains

	The team that scores more runs wins the game
	

Flame Away

So what does that have to do with RBIs  The team with the most RBIs
doesnt necessarily win the game

Yes runs are the most important statistice  for a team  So why does
every newspaper rank team offense by batting average

But for an individual player runs and RBIs are contextdependent and tell
us very little about the player himself and more about his teammates and
position in the batting order
