Ron Hassey will be a minor league manager with the Yankees

Dunno what happened to him

Maybe I can help you Hes a major league coach with the Rockies
So above prediction is doubly wrong

My prediction The Red SoxCubs Series and VikingsBroncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
year

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 350

And the Rangers fade will not begin untilAugust Theyll give way
to the Angels But still challenge to the end

Really Not making any of this up If I am may God strike me down ZZZZZZT



Thanks for listening
Valentine
