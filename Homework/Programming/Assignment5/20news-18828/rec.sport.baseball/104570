Subject PHILS NL EAST NOT SO WEAK

I Love it how all of these people are blaming the Phillies success 
on a weak division  Why dont we look at the record of the teams in 
each division READ InterDivisional Play well see that the East 
is really kicking the shit out of the West  I know it is early but 
that is all we have to go on  Atlanta is just so strong with their 
188 BA Cincinnati is 27 coming off a sweep at Veterans Stadium in 
Philadelphia and Houston was swept in its first three games by the 
Phillies in the Astrodome  That my Western Division friends shows 
that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you 
think

PHILS ALL THE WAY IN 93
BRAVES HIT LIKE A AAA CLUB
REDS NEED MARGE
