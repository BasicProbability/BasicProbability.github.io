 For those of you who like both Bob and baseball check out the
 current Village Voice April 13 p141  John Lammers and Hart 
 Seely have written The Bob Dylan Baseball Abstract and they have
 covered every team in both leagues
 
 Example 
 Colorado  An the silent bats will shatter  From the scores between
 the lines  For theyre one too many castoffs  And a thousand runs
 behind
