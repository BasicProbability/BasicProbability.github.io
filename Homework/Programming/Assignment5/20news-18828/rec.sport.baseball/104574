Does anybody in the Pittsburgh area know why Mike LaValliere was released
Last year I kept saying that Slaught should get the bulk of the playing time
that he was clearly the better player at this point but Leyland insisted on
keeping a pretty strict platoon  And now he is released  That doesnt
make any sense to me

Greg

    The story goes like this

       Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didnt want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely

      Dont feel too bad for him  Hes still gonna get theat 4000000
over the next two years  hell be able to do most of what he wants to
do
