Was going over some videos last night


And you wrote an excellent report about it


1  Hes bulked up too much  Period  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds
    not gain more bulk

2  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED  Conservatively Id say hes
    lost 47 of his bat speed and thats a HUGE amount of speed

3  That open stance is KILLING him   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing  way open to start then closes up as ball is
    released  Downing could do this without significant head movement 
    Canseco cant  Also note that Canseco doesnt always close his
    stance the same way  sometimes his hips are open sometimes
    theyre fully closed  Without a good starting point its hard
    to make adjustments in your swing


I understand from an unreliable source that Canseco was considered
expendable by the As when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance  The As brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated if not caused by having a wide open
stance closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
thats a paraphrase of what I remember

In any event Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance and the As began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power



Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch
so that Id never have to work again Id restructure my entire swing

Apparently you sound like LaRussa

Second drop 20 pounds  Cut out the weight work

The As also objected about this


If Cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems hell be out of baseball in three years  If not he could
still hit 600 HR

Again Im just repeating something I heard  But possibly the cause
and effect is the reverse of that
