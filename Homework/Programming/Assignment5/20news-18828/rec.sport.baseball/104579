Subject The Bob Dylan Baseball Abstract


Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice which
is not noted for its sports coverage but occasionally the print some
interesting features  This year the predictionsteam analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics  I
dont have the article in front of me so Ill only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to  I could dig up more
if there is interest

Yankess to the tune of Subterranean Homesick Blues

Howe is in the basement mixing up the medicine
George is on the pavement thinking bout the government
Wade Boggs in a trench coat bat out paid off
Says hes got a bad back wants to get it laid off
Look out kids its somethin you did
Dont know when but its Columbus again

Mets to the tune of Like a Rolling Stone

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime didnt you
People said Beware Cone hes bound to roam
But you thought they were just kidding you
You used to laugh about 
The Strawberry that was headin out
But now you dont talk so loud
Now you dont seem so proud
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal

Phillies to the tune of Highway 61

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun
Just keep them off of Highway 61

Giants to the tune of The Ballad of Rubin Hurricane Carter

This is the story of the Magowan
The man St Petersburg came to pan
For something that he never done
Hes sit in the owners box but one
Day he could have the Tampian of the world
