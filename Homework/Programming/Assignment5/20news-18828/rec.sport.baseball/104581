Id be willing to make two wagers
1 Snow doesnt win ROY
2 Mattingly is out of baseball within five years

Im skeptical of the first because I dont think Snow is that good a
player and he is on a losing team


I dont have a history handy but I dont recall that the preponderance
of ROYs come from winning teams  In fact I think team performance is
generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins
Am I wrong

And he is not necessarily on a losing team  While the Angels staff
is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank
you  Snow is playing great  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments
Easley appears fine but even if hes not Flora is ready to come up
Between Gonzales and Gruber theyll manage the hot corner  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady  Even Myers and Orton are contributing

Personally I think they can finish over 500 which makes them a 
winning team

Im skeptical of the second because of his back  Mattingly is 32 this
year and how many players play until they are 40  Not too many and
most of them didnt have chronic back problems when they were 32

Could be wrong on either or both but I think thats the smart way to
bet

Cheers
Valentine
