Subject Re DAVE KINGMAN FOR THE HALL OF FAME


Im no Kingman fan  Just thought Id point out that hes the
only player in history to have five threeHR games  Joe Carter
has four  Eddie Murray three  McCovey and Gehrig also three
Ruth Mays Foxx and Dawson two each

I dont think Reggies WS game counts else I believe he would 
also have had two
