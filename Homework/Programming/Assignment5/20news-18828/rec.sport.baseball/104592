I dont have a history handy but I dont recall that the preponderance
of ROYs come from winning teams  In fact I think team performance is
generally irrelevant as almost always the most deserving candidate wins
Am I wrong

Not really though I wouldnt personally say the most deserving
candidate wins  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid
season and there have been several duds in recent years  But this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else  I wonder  If
Amaral hits like he is capable of will he receive ROTY votes  Hes
only 31 he could have a long career ahead of him  

And he is not necessarily on a losing team  While the Angels staff
is still very weak their everyday lineup is doing quite well thank
you  Snow is playing great  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments
Easley appears fine but even if hes not Flora is ready to come up
Between Gonzales and Gruber theyll manage the hot corner  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady  Even Myers and Orton are contributing

Personally I think they can finish over 500 which makes them a 
winning team

I think they are a seconddivision team  They should finish ahead of
the Royals Mariners and possibly Athletics  But I dont think
theyll be above 500  I think the East is stronger this year

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible  This
year their offense is better but their pitching is still pretty bad
Even if Finley returns to form he wont replace what they lost in
Abbott  Sanderson  Farrell  I dont believe it

And while their BA may be good and they have decent speed their
offense lacks punch  They dont have any bona fide power hitters
Salmon Snow Davis and Curtis  None with more than 20 HR
potential

PS Which AL team had the most steals last week  Those gogo Tigers
The mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more
balance in their lineup  You see they were scoring too many runs
too consistently  Gotta run more to break that up
