  baseball players past and present  We werent able to come up
  with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
  maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
  it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
  humor us  Thanks for your help
  
 
 
 John Lowenstein is definately NOT Jewish  Many in Baltimore thought he  
was
 especially after he told the Baltimore Jewish Times sobut later he
 admitted that it was a joke


Stanky is NOT Jewish at least I doubt it A lot of jewish people dont  
have Jewish names
