 Not clear to me at all  Id certainly rather have a team who was winning
 41 games than 21 games  In the 21 game luck is going to play a much
 bigger role than in the 41 game 

But you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to
one run

Yeah but whats your point  You still need the offense to score more runs
than you allow too  

The Braves do have a fine pitching staff  But thats still only half the
game
