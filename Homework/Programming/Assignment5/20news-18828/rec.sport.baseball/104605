       Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didnt want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely

Tom Prince is a 28 year old nohit catcher  Think of him as a young Dann
Bilardello  I cant begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of
losing this guy whos been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons  The Pirates
released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options then
eventually sent Prince down anyway and he cleared waivers without a peep
Hes another year older and still cant hit why do they think he wouldnt
clear waivers now  Why would they care
