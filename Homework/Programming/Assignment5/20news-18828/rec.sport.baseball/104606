Subject Re New Home for the Bosox


 I agree though Id also be happy with a stadium that looks
 like new Comiskey The new park was also made for baseball
 Unlike Three Rivers the Vet Riverfront etc its not a
 football park in which they also play baseball
 
While were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget Shea which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets  Jets  It was the first
stadium I think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football

Of course with the Jets gone to Jersey and a truly good football
stadium the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where
because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the
action  The Mets announcersKiner  Murphy in particularhave
always hyped it as beautiful Shea
Stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is
