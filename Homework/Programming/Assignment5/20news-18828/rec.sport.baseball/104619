  He probably didnt even have as good a season as
 Alomar last year

 Uh yes  Baerga has a lot of flash but Alomar was the better hitter
 last year
 
stats deleted  weve all seen them by now
This is fascinating  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last 
year and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that Baerga
had a better year  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP

I nominate this last bit for AntiStathead Quote of the Week

Alomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensive
category while Baerga who studied in the Joe Carter School of OutBurning
has more impressive mediot stats largely due to opportunities rather
than quality

The lines are fairly close in value but edge to Alomar

Now Baerga aint chopped liver but Alomar is still the man to beat among
AL second basemen
