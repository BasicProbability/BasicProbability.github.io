Subject proposed catcher resub rule

A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster
but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used  He is only
insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher
is injured during a game     So to free up this roster
spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever why not
invoke a catcher resubstitution rule

If the last roster catcher on a team is
injured during a game the team is permitted
to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
a catcher who has previously been yanked from
the game   

Given this rule a team wouldnt need 3 roster
catchers  The 3rd catcher could be playing
in AAA or be a nonroster bullpen catcher
