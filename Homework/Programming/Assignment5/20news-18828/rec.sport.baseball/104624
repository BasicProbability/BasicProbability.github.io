 Hey guys who is this Jack Morris fella 




 















ONLY JOKING  But try to lighten up will ya  The seasons only just 
started and everyones apoplectic If all you statheads out there are trying to
justify how Morris is doing at the moment just remember that were talking
about a very small sample size There is a helluva long way to go so sit back
and enjoy the ride
