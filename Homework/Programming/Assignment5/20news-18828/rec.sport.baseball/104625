   Does anyone else think that this weekends fourgame series was a
 really strange one
 
 Yeah it was real strange if you think the Braves should be awarded the
 NL West title without actually having to play the games

  I didnt say that  Did you say that  Wow I cant believe that
anyone would think that the Braves or any other team for that matter
should get the title for free  What a dolt that person would be if
that was what they thought  Incredible
