As a touter of Braves prospects all I can say is that IMO
someone on the Braves roster is about to become Pipped
It may not even be Hunter  But I think theyll have a
problem getting Klesko out of the lineup once hes in

Well this may be good news  If Klesko hits Id look for Bream to be
traded if possible or released since Bream is also a lefthander  Hope
Klesko hits

According to the Atlanta paper Bream will be the fulltime first baseman
with Klesko used as a lateinning defensive replacement if Bream is lifted
for a pinchrunner Hed have to hit a homer in his first AB or win the
game or do some other amazing thing to be rewarded with a start so he could
even attempt to push Hunter or Bream out of the lineup
