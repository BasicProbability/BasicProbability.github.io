However what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games
You are the first person  nonmediot  I have seen endorse this policy
I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the
ESPN crowd  and other announcers  bitching about it  I have never
been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and
shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a ticket I dont mind
a game that last more than 210  I really dont understand it

I agree with Nick  Whats the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball theres that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games especially when
its coming from TV people has to something to do with advertising
Probably time wasted in the middle of an inning say by a batter
stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves or by a pitcher
walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts could
otherwise be sold as advertising time
