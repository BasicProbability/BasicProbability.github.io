However what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games

I agree with Nick  Whats the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball theres that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write but
neither of you two sound as though you have kids and you may not have
spouses either

Consider a night game starting at 705 PM EST  It was 735 last year
but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back
I go and Im into it until 11 PM minimum  Extra innings could put me
well past midnight  Even without extra innings if the score is beyond
21 I cant see my family that night at all  If the next day is a workday
I may have to bag that as well  Further the later the game goes the
colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie

All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game  If
you say you dont care about whether the game is sped up IMPO you are 
saying you dont care where the time goes and that the game is for people
who dont have families and dont have to get up for work the next day
