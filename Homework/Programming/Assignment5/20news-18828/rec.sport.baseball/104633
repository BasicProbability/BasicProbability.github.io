Devon White has not been in the Blue Jays line up
lately Does anybody know why he is not playing 
 
 During one of the games last week Wednesday both White and Sprauge
 were not playing because they had the flu  I guess White is probably
 still sick  I hope White gets back in the lineup soon watching
 Darrin Jackson play center is painful

I heard he had a strained abdominal muscle or something like that
