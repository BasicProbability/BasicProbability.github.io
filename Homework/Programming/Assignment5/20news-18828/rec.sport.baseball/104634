I suppose a foul ball machine like Brett Butler is pretty valuable
but Id rather watch and root for the lower OBP guys who can
actually hit the ball

Now this is a legitimate point  Baseball is entertainment and I have no
quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than
others regardless of their winvalue  Personally Im a huge fan of the
slugbunt I doubt its a highpercentage play but I get a big kick out of
it  I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun

Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarragas
inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt
paid to walk or is an RBI guy or whatever

And finally Id like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

Im not sure  I used to think this was true but more and more Im becoming
convinced that its the other way around among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot

Lets break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot


			Power			No Power

	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler
			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith
			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck
			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins
			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton
			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost
			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove
			   			   
			   			   
			   			   

	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen
			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston
			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas
			George Bell		Jose Lind
			Kirby Puckett		Devon White
	etc

As far as I can tell all the categories are full  It really looks like the
two are independent  Nobody could possibly be afraid of Craig Grebeck at
the plate and yet he walks quite a lot  Part of that undoubtedly is being
small of stature but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of 
target at least 3 times out of 6  Randy Milligan is an even better example
hes only shown noticeable power for one partial season but he walks all
over the place despite his huge strike zone
