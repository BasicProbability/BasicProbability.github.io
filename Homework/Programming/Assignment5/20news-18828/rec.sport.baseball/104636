that HED been thrown out  And Gant had a legitimate beef about
the 10 pitch that was called a strike  A reasonable umpire would
not have tried to FORCE Gant back into the box in that situation

A reasonable umpire would do as hes been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games  I for one am glad to see this happen and hope more
umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter wont get back in the box  

So what if the previous strike call was bogus  Its in the past it cant
be changed get back in there and deal with the next pitch  

Sorry Sherri but I cant agree with this particular incident  While
Im all for cutting down the number of chainrattles and other examples
of rampant Hargroving there was a difference here

1  Since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
So have pitchers and catchers  Usually nothing happens
Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing
complaints Hirschbeck was acting against expectations

2  Its not as if Gant was in Hirschbecks face  Gant said
something about the call stepped out of the box and turned away
from Hirschbeck  As a hitter alibet of little consequence but
with a decent eye whenever receiving the short end of the stick
on a questionable call Id want a moment or two out of the box
if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on
the experience of the last pitch  And if I was really angry
at the ump Id rather turn away and catch my breath than
turn to him and say something that might get me tossed
especially at a key moment in the game

When Gant turned away Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant
to step into the box  IMO at this point in time Hirschbeck
was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game
Gant wasnt dawdling he hadnt had a chance to dawdle  And Hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play  Gant resisted as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request and
Hirschbeck called for the pitch  At that point Cox came out on
the field the pitch was thrown and many other Braves left the
dugout  Cox was tossed protecting his player  I was pleasantly
surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game

Its a small sample size but based on what I saw in that game
Mark Hirschbeck has a hairtrigger temper and a need to play
God on the field  Not good qualities for an umpire  I will
keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the 
future in order to improve my sample size

IMO any game where you remember the name of the umpire was
a bad game for the umpire
