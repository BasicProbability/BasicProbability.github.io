1 The current roster of the Lynx

Someone on the minor league mailing list probably does 

2 Home game schedule of the Lynx

I do but I dont have time to type the whole thing in I dont mind looking
up specific date ranges or individual games when I can but there are
limits 

Besides this stuff is EASY to find Baseball America puts out a book called
the Directory Its 10US Has every teams data and schedule in it If I
WERE to type in the whole scheudle Id just be spending a lot of time
infringing on their copyright

Folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list
see the signature and folks who are tracking down team schedules should
chec out the BA Directory You can order it from 8008452726 I find it
indispenable
