No but I am for starting recsportsidiots for people who respond to 
obvious flamebait

Nah lets reserve recsportsidiots for people who POST
obvious flamebait like yourself

Funny  I didnt realize Mr Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v Pam Postema
in the first place  Thought it was someone named Jacobs

If someone posts something as controversial not to mention
idiotic as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup
someone should challenge the statement  

Why  If a statement is truly idiotic and is universally thought so
the challenge is a waste of panting  Further challenges that have
nothing yes nothing to do with baseball are wasting others time

You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks  Lets hear it in
some sort of categorical manner  Actually I question whether either
Knepper or Postema arent old news at this point although what I
have read of Postemas book is interesting

There is a school of thought that suggests that silence  consent  

I agree this far

Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life it certainly
SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion

Sez you

If youve been reading rsb lately youll find
that even elementary school children have had access
to our postings albeit in an edited form  Its making me
think a little more carefully about some of the things I post

That does not come out in what you say down the road here

In conclusion if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel
in some obscure newsgroup that I dont read fine  Hes got the
right to rant rave and drool all he wants to in the name
of free speech  But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read
then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal
to his drooling

Yo  Even elementary school children have had access to our postings
albeit in an edited form  You want them to hear you talk like this
Dont you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think
you like to do the same  Or do you want them to think youre some 
politically correct demagogue whos ohso sensitive  Hohum

Plus youre here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that
I dont read  What BS  You got a problem with what Jacobs says what
Knepper thinks all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas more
and better speech  Yours is the easy way out

As for Knepper ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of
them  You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isnt
preprepared  They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women they
pop some question about Postema  An interesting related question would 
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game  Off the top of my head
I guess no  If my guess is right Knepper popped off about something that
had nothing to do with him  and Postema gets a book for it and he doesnt

Now of course you dont have to read any of this
And if you want to cut down on flames then DONT POST FLAMEBAIT
You dont have to respond to flames either  Saves cyberspace

Now why didnt I think of that
