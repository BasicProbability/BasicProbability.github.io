Quick name a
lighthitting black outfielder or 1B who lasted 10 years in the bigs
I bet you can name two dozen white ones
Otis Nixon
Stole 300 bases  Ok hes still lighthitting but baseball managers dont
think so they think he like Omar Moreno before him is a perfect leadoff
man  Awesome defense

Well yeah On the other hand for the first few years of his career he
looked like Herb Washington Dan Gladden doesnt seem to suck defensively
either

Darnell Coles
Hes still around because of his 1986 when he hit 20 HR
Yeah and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career
Its actually not an uncommon phenomenon and how long a guy hangs around
based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a
racial basis

Billy Hatcher
Well see if hes still around in 1994 for his tenth year
Hey he plays for Lou Gorman doesnt he OK so its eight years

OK I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook but
only after the first 7 or 8 Oh and theres the alltime lighthitting
black outfielder Lou Brock Look it up And Curt Flood Cesar Geronimo
Cesar Cedeno 
Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease but he wasnt perceived as
lighthitting  Neither was Curt Flood  Cesar Cedeno was not light
hitting

Good point on Cedeno OTOH I havent seen that extensive list of 10year
Dan Gladdens either There really arent that many players altogether who
hang around for 10 years even if theyre reasonably good
