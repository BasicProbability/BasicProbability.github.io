Subject How to speed up games marginally realistic

You want to speed up ballgames

1  Enforce the two minutes between innings  As it is many fields are
    allowing THREE minutes between them  Fifteen seconds before 
    TV commercials are gone to Thirty or so before action begins upon
    the return to the game  Two minutes last out to first pitch or
    a ball is called

2  Dont grant time to batters just because they want it  They may get
    pissed at first but theyll get in line once anything the pitcher
    throws while theyre adjusting their wristbands is a strike

3  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current
    rule is too lenient and then enforce it  Fifteen seconds is more
    than enough time  If the pitch isnt released in 15 call it a ball
    and restart the clock

Baseball games take about 251 in the NL and just a shade under 3 hours
in the AL  Thats just too damn long  I dont like to PLAY in 3 hour
games much less WATCH a game for that long  My butt falls asleep and
if Im watching on TV Ill channel surf between pitches catching
colorized versions of Mr Ed Leave it to Beaver and Those Wacky
Nieporents on Nick at Nite
