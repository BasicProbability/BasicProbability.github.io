Just a refresherthe baseballs came on the field during Sundays
slugfest when a Giants patron refused to throw an Atlanta HR back

	The garbage started hitting the field well before the Sunday
game  It started on Thursday or Friday I cant recall which games I
didnt watch on TBS  Deion was getting pelted with trash the whole
time it seemed  The announcers talked about the change in the seating
in the bleachers and how that made it easier for the events that
transpired  I actually thought at the start of the Sunday slugfest that
since it was a Sunday daygame the crowd would be a little different
more refined  Surprise
