	Someone told me this game started at 1005 cdt  Is this true Who
in their right mind would go to a game on monday at 11AM

Keep in mind this was in Massachussetts  Today was Patriots Day a state
holiday  I think it might be a floating holiday but given that the
Marathon also happens the same day most people dont go in
