   However what is with this policy of trying to speed up the
 games  You are the first person  nonmediot  I have seen endorse
 this policy  I have no problem with the length of games at all and
 am tired of the ESPN crowd  and other announcers  bitching about
 it  I have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
 at their watches and shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a 
 ticket I dont mind a game that last more than 210  I really dont
 understand it  
 

Major League Baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans ie the football crowd   Invariably all the
arguments from people who dont like to watch baseball on TV say the
same thing  the games are too long and too boring  Baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider TV appeal  If you look at
it though baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games  The difference is that there is more action in that duration in
football games  Perhaps if there were more action in baseball games you
would get more of those fans to tune in  Anyway coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult
On soapbox Yet another reason to get a commisioner NOW since its obvious
that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in
Nebraska Off soapbox
