Its certainly not very easy  What I do is use frame advance on the tape
and simply count the frames  Five times and try to throw out any outliers
Its not perfect but its better than a blow to the head with a large
metal object

  Ah so you finally found a use for that super slomo and frame advance
other than scrutinizing Sorority Babes in Heat Congrats 

I wish I had FILMS instead of tapes preferably at 48fps rather than 24
but while Im at it Id like to have ten million dollars and be able
to eat anything I want and never gain any weight either

  Trust me youd have a helluva time manipulating them Besides if you
converted the film to video youd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
difference in frame rate unless youre an expert at doing 32 pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something 

Garys list of the ten slowest bats in baseball

  Hey no fair What about Fettucine Alfredo Griffin The guy practically
has to pivot the bat around along with his body 

Garys list of How the HELL can he hit like that

1  Julio Franco
2  Phil Plantier
9  Darren Daulton

  Daulton doesnt strike me as all that strange Hes a little bit quiet at 
the plate but like Franco gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane The first time I watched Julio Franco I didnt think anyone could
hit like that Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look every time he makes
contact its solid Hes got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while on the throne  Sure looks like it  

  How bout one to add to your list Travis Fryman The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing across his body He generates a lot of power but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips 

Garys list of Id give Dave Kirschs kidneys to have a swing like that

  Well theyre already spoken for by several people but  

  Id add Robbie Alomars name to the list among others I really like Dean
Palmers swing for some twisted reason as well as Pedro Munozs swing 

Thats all for now  Im looking at Derrick Mays tapes tonight along
with Troy Neels  That guy is a serious ox

  A thought about May It looks like theyve taught him to turn on the ball
IMHO hes going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that hes going to see lots of sinkerssliders
low and away Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and leftcenter IMHO youre going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month
