I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write but
neither of you two sound as though you have kids and you may not have
spouses either

I wonder why you say that  I dont see why having a spouse andor
kids would have anything to do with it  It might if you brought
your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get
to bed at a reasonable hour in which case Id probably decide
to take my kids to games on weekends as many people do or else
be prepared to leave the game early but from what you say later
on you dont bring your kids or your spouse to the game
As it happens I have a husband but no kids and my husband usually
attends games with me

Extra innings could put me
well past midnight  Even without extra innings if the score is beyond
21 I cant see my family that night at all  If the next day is a workday
I may have to bag that as well  

I can see its a problem if you dont bring your wife to the ballgame
but thats a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 12 hours  As far
as bagging work the next day I dont really understand why thats
necessary unless going to a game also means that you consume vast
quantities of beer I note that this is the case for many guys
If you dont think you can get up to go to work after a long evening
out then dont have long evenings out during the week

All that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game  If
you say you dont care about whether the game is sped up IMPO you are 
saying you dont care where the time goes and that the game is for people
who dont have families and dont have to get up for work the next day

Look if I pay between 800 and 2000 apiece for tickets plus 1000 
for parking plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston 
plus spending additional money on concessions etc at the ballpark then 
I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money
I cant afford to go to a lot of games  Hence going to a game is a
big deal like going to a play or an opera  Maybe you have more money than 
I do and can go to games all year long so its not such a big deal for you  
But Im not interested in having games sped up any more than I want to
have Die Walkure cut down to a convenient weeknight version of two
hours  If I felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere 
with my family life or my work life then Id choose to go to a weekend game

IMPO
