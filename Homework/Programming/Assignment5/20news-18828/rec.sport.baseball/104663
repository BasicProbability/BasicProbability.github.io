	Cox shouldve protested the game the second time the garbage got
thrown at his outfielders  He should also have protested the game at the
point where Ron Gant was assessed the second strike in the ninth on the
grounds that he Cox was on the field and time should have been called

Both protests would be denied of course  The umpires judgement
determines the garbage thing although I think the game should be
called but thats my personal opiniondoesnt matter  There
is time only when the ump says so the second argument is baseless
