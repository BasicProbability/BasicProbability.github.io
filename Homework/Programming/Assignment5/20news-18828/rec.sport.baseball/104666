Subject A modest request

I am finding the volume of stuff on recsportbaseball
overwhelming  ca 200 postsday  An effect of this is
that a backlog builds up and many posts get dumped from
my system  I could probably fix thatbut dont have the
time to read them all in any event  My guess is that mine
is a common problem  I have some ideas that would help

1  Each person generally post no more than one articleday
2  Limit the extent to which previous posts are reproduced
    in posts
3  Dont post mindless woofs or antiwoofs eg The
    Jays are best  or  The Jays suck
4  Dont respond to mindless posts eg  Jack Morris is
    a better pitcher than Frank Viola because hes won a 
    World Series  I know that you can use the n key to
    get by these posts but they bump interesting posts from
    my disk
5  use the goddamn shift key etc it makes your posts easier
    to read
