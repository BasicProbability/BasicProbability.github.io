 Sundays game exposed the weaknesses of both teams quite clearly
 and that the Braves are vulnerable
 
 Braves weaknesses
 aweak defense a couple of Bonds doubles and a bloop by
  Clayton wouldve been caught by a better outfield  
 bweak bullpen  ha ha their closers are Bedrosian and Howell

Not an astute observation  this is a strawbullpen  The lefties
Stanton  Mercker are strong and Wohlers is down learning a new pitch
The bullpen is fine probably superior

 coverreliance on Pendleton a Pendleton slump becomes a team slump
 

Also false  Gant Nixon Justice Hunter Blauser present a decent enough
offense  EVERYONE is slumping except Blauser not just Pendleton

BTW what is the story with Brian Hunter  Is he in the dog house
