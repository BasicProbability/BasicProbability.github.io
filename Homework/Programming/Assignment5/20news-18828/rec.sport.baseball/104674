   I suppose a foul ball machine like Brett Butler is pretty valuable
   but Id rather watch and root for the lower OBP guys who can
   actually hit the ball

And Id rather watch and root for a team that scores lots of runs
and wins games

Of course Im rooting for the Rockies and Andres anyway  But thats
for irrational hometown reaons  I also root for Frank Thomas
