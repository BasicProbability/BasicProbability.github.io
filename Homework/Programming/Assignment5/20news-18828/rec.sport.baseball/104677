Manuel Lee is better than Jeff Blauser

Again if you had Lee on your team last year you would be wearing a ring
this year

Erno

Eryes  If Manny Lee was on your team last year your team would have been
the Toronto Blue Jays

My team is the Albuquerque Leftturns  If Manny Lee were on my team I would
not be wearing a ring  Nor would he  If however I were on Manny Lees team

Again  If Manny Lee was on your team last year your team would not have been
the Albuquerque Leftturns  It would have been the Toronto Blue Jays

the Toronto Blue Jays I might well be wearing a ring  Not that thats such
a big dealeverybody got a WS ring from the Jays win

Thats the whole point isnt it  Clemens didnt get a ring but Morris did

In the same way the Blue Jays did not win because Jack Morris was on the team
Jack Morris won because he was on the Blue Jays  It was a team effort not
an individual one

Exactly  And Morris was part of the team  Would the Jays have won with 
Clemens  We will never know  But we do know that the Jays won with Morris
So how could you possibly say that Clemens had a better year  No pitcher
in baseball could have had a better year than Morris had last year
