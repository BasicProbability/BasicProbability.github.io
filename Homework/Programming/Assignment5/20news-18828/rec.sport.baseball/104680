Jackson is a bum  And I thought the Jays were smart to get rid of Gruber
Now we get equally bad  Im frustrated  Pat Gillick is over rated  Sure
he did some good moves in the past but releasing Wells although his
temper sucks but hes better than MorrisStewartDayley  If the Jays
were dumping salaries to keep 2mill Jackson Dayley should be the one to
go before Wells  Of course they dumped Dayley but its too late since

Dayleys salary was guarenteedwith Wells the Jays were only on the
hook for 25 of it

Give Jackson a breakhe lost about 10 pounds with that flu he had
when he was traded

Wells was already claimed by the Tigers 06 ERA with 2 wins  Also the
Jimmy Key and Winfield situations pissed the hell outta me  Would you see
a championship club wanting to repeat so badly wanted to have such a

I would rather have Molitor than WinfieldWinfield was just hogging
all the credit and he was trying to soak the Jays for a 3 year
guarenteed contract

great turnover  No way  Look at the Pittsburg Penguins  They got some
aging players but didnt make stupid trades to dump them cuz the fans love
those players and they are still the core of the team  Anyways I just
want to say that if the Jays go BELOW 500 this season I wont be
surprised  Im not jumping off the bandwagon Im just talking smart
baseball  No matter what Im still going to see most of the Jays games
even though Im damn frustrated


The Jays pitching can only get betterMolitor and Alomar havent hit
anything yetand the Jays are still over 500
