1 why would owners decrease ticket prices when they obviously get
   lots of people to pay the price theyre asking


I dont think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing
to pay the price  Im sure someone out there in netland has some
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
sold  But even if the trends are relatively flat you have to consider
what is happening on a teambyteam basis

When the TV money dries up franchises will be seeking to supplant the
lost revenues from alternative sources  One of the best sources may
be ticket sales

Example 1	The Dodgers

	The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales
	and probably believe that they have the ability to raise
	prices without hindering revenues  I certainly think that is
	true

Example 2	The Padres

	They will be lucky to average 10000 fans a game this year
	If they raise prices less  If they want to increase their
	overall revenue base the best thing they can do is put a
	winning team on the field  But given that wont happen it
	wont they can probably make more money by lowering ticket
	prices and running frequent promotions  Will they do that
	I have no idea  But they wont increase prices because it
	wont work for them


2 even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners
   decrease ticket prices that does not decrease the tv contract


The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place
Each teams market is somewhat different and each owner is going to
be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those
market forces  As a buiness manager I would never want to lower my
prices but sometimes that strategy is necessary and sometimes it works
You have to consider everything if you want continued success
