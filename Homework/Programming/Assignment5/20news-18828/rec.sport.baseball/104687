Havent been to many As games have you

Theres also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if Im
watching them on the tube and if Im going there in person  For me going
to an As game has become a major commitment of time one that Im not
willing to make that often  the length of their games is costing the As
revenue from me

I stopped going to As games some years ago while I still lived inthe
Bay Area for exactly this reason  I believe the length of their games
has been institutionalized by LaRussaDuncan  They encourage their
pitchers to be overly deliberate to throw to first often to study
the catchers signals and so on  And almost every As hitter takes
a step out of the box after every pitch  This is not imo a coincidence
This is planned  And I hate it

As for the Gant situation I did not see the game or the replays  But
I do wonder  What if Gant had requested a time out  Would Hirschbeck
have been required to give it to him  Could he have denied the requst
For all he the ump knew Gant could have had dirt in his eye
