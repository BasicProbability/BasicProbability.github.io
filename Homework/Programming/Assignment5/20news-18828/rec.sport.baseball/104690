Subject Re Rockies spoonfeed game to Mets

Is it just me or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield  He 
misplayed Martinez flyout into a double against the Expos misplayed
Alous single into a triple Alou tagged out at 3rd after oversliding 
the bag and now he misplays another out into a 3 run tripleadd in his
wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player
