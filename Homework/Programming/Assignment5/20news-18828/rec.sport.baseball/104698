The Royals are darkness  They are the void of our time
When they play shame descends upon the land like a cold front
from Canada   They are a humiliation to all who have lived and
all who shall ever live   They are utterly and completely
doomed

Other than that I guess theyre OK

You must not be old enough to remember the As in KC
