Subject Moe Berg

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy name possibly
garbled by me an official historian for the CIA  She has won an Emmy
for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary which I know from nothing
but which sounds good  She said that among other things Berg was the 
principal spy for the OSS CIAs WWII precursor spying on Axis atomic
programs because of his physics background and language skills  She said
that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland and had 
instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb
research he concluded they were two years behind and didnt shoot him
I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb
program but I dont know how reliable this is  Unfortunately NPR didnt
mention any kind of a book shes writing  Id certainly buy it

In case youre wondering about baseball relevance Berg was a longtime
MLB backup catcher  He was a member of an MLB AllStar team that toured
Japan in 1934 presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because
he was one of the few Americans much less MLB players who spoke Japanese
Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids
according to McCarthy
