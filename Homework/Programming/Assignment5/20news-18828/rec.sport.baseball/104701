John Dopson pitched his first major league shutout as the 
Red Sox beat the White Sox 60 All 6 Sox runs came in 
the 6th inning which featured big hits from among others
Vaughan and Greenwell
The Sox are now 103

AND the first team in the majors to win 10 games Yes Itll never last but
God its good while its here

	Someone told me this game started at 1005 cdt  Is this true Who
in their right mind would go to a game on monday at 11AM

Well theres a holiday in Massachusetts called Patriots Day Three things
happen on Patriots Day almost all businesses are closed the Sox play a
morning game and they run the Boston Marathon
