And finally Id like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

This comes up periodically and I just dont get it Take for example Mark
McGwire He walked 90 times in 1993 If thats not a potential great example
of what youre talking about then I dont know what is Now lets look at
what happens when McGwire doesnt walk
  75 of the time he made an out
  10 of the time he hit a single
  5 of the time he hit a double
  10 of the time he hit a homer
Now youre pitching against McGwire Would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers
1 double 2 singles and 15 outs I would Why give him the base when you
can get him out 3 times out of 4
Then there are guys like Alex Cole who has a career 363 OBP even
though hes never had a batting average over 300 he did hit 300 in
227 AB in 1990 or hit a single home run Yep thats right hes
never hit a homer in 916 ABs through the end of 1992 Whod be
afraid to throw a strike to him
