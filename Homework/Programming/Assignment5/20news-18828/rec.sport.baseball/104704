Subject Red Sox Choke Contest

To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism I am having a 
contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox fall from their current 
heights  You must decide first whether the Sox will be at 500 again
at any time during this year  Then you must predict either

1 Their record the first time theyre at 500 if they are or

2 Their final record if they stay above 500 the rest of the year

So Valentines earlier prediction would go as 1313 resend it if you 
were serious Val

ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was
in 1952 when they finished 7678 in sixth place

So email me your guess either at barringcswashingtonedu or directly
replying to this post
