However what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games
You are the first person  nonmediot  I have seen endorse this policy
I have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the
ESPN crowd  and other announcers  bitching about it  I have never
been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and
shouting Hurry up  If I cough up big bucks for a ticket I dont mind
a game that last more than 210  I really dont understand it

I agree with Nick  Whats the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball theres that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

First a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball  The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches

And while its true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this
is only true when they dont become extralong  Quicklypitched games
can grab and hold your attention much better

Bring back the twohour baseball game  And the three and a half hour
golf game with it
