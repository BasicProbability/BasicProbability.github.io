Subject Re How to speed up games marginally realistic

Baseball games take about 251 in the NL and just a shade under 3 hours
in the AL  Thats just too damn long  I dont like to PLAY in 3 hour
games much less WATCH a game for that long  My butt falls asleep and
if Im watching on TV Ill channel surf between pitches catching
colorized versions of Mr Ed Leave it to Beaver and Those Wacky
Nieporents on Nick at Nite

But Gary for certain sofa tubers like myself this is an advantage  I
can watch the Pirates on KBL the Mets on WWOR the Braves on TBS and the
mediots on ESPN at the same time without missing anything  If something
impressive happens Ill catch the replay  

So I see essentially 4 games in 3 hours instead of 1 game in 2 hours
What a deal

Insert smileys as desired
