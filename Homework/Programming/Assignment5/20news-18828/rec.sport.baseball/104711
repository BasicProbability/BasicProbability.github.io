Subject Re Moe Berg

barringcswashingtonedu David Barrington writes

NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy name possibly
garbled by me an official historian for the CIA  She has won an Emmy
for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary which I know from nothing
but which sounds good  She said that among other things Berg was the 
principal spy for the OSS CIAs WWII precursor spying on Axis atomic
programs because of his physics background and language skills  She said
that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland and had 
instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb
research he concluded they were two years behind and didnt shoot him
I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb
program but I dont know how reliable this is  Unfortunately NPR didnt
mention any kind of a book shes writing  Id certainly buy it

There is a great book out called They Also Served which is about the 
ballplayers during WWII  There is some info on Berg in there  It also has 
info on Pete Gray one armed outfielder and other players of the era  Because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the
draft for medical reasons  There are some very interesting stories in the
book It is very well written and I would suggest reading it to anyone with an 
interest in baseball
