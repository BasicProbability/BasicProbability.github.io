 You want to speed up ballgames
  
 3  Mandate a rule permitting only N seconds between pitches the current
     rule is too lenient and then enforce it  Fifteen seconds is more
     than enough time  If the pitch isnt released in 15 call it a ball
     and restart the clock
 
I remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work  I dont remember
why they said that it did not work  Anyone remember this

Jody McDonnel on WIP in Phil has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable  How would a pitch clock work on throws to first

Another pair of suggestions
1 Remove the Balk rule  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
   no matter what the pitcher does

2 If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time X  3 to 5
   without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base
   as if walked

The nobalk seems to give the pitcher the advantage  The basewalk allows
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base

 Baseball games take about 251 in the NL and just a shade under 3 hours
 in the AL  Thats just too damn long  I dont like to PLAY in 3 hour
 games much less WATCH a game for that long  My butt falls asleep and
 if Im watching on TV Ill channel surf between pitches catching
 colorized versions of Mr Ed Leave it to Beaver and Those Wacky
 Nieporents on Nick at Nite

I too find myself surfing when I know that it will be enough time between
each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery
