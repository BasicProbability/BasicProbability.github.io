  Ok Roger heres a question for you  Say you are running an expansion
team  You dont HAVE a team at the moment but the draft is coming up  Who
are you going to pick guys who have won the most WS rings or guys who 
COULD contribute the most to your team  Say the Reds were dumb enough to 
not protect Larkin and the Jays didnt protect Alfredo  Who would you
pick

For an expansion team  Im pretty sure I would go with the rings as long
as their salaries and ages werent too high  I would want the fans to be 
able to identify the players  I would like a championship attitude in the 
clubhouse

As for Larkin and Griffin  Salaries aside I would have to consider which
player is likeliest to contribute to a WS victory  Past performance age and
attitude would all be integral to my decision  I certainly wouldnt just
haul out my copy of Gillete and pick Larkin as many others would  And
unlike many others who post to this group I hardly consider myself quali
fied to make those kinds of decisions

    I cant believe Im getting involved in this 

I have never been able to believe it about myself to tell you the truth
Its like banging your head against a stone wall

 

cordially as always                      maynardramseycslaurentianca
