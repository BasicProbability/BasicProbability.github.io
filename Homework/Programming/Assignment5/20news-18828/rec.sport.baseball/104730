1  Since time immemorial batters have complained about calls
So have pitchers and catchers
 
 However batters didnt use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree
 they do now  

  I really think that this is the key point  When I saw the incident on
Baseball Tonight Sunday I couldnt believe how far away from the plate
Gant went  Then he casually leaned against his bat  I dont blame the 
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch

  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the
field  What were they going to do attack the umpire  The only people
who shouldve been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches but NO players
I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team
