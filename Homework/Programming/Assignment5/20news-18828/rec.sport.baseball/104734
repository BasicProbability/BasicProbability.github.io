Being an old time Cardinal Fannow relocated to the NVA areaI can
recall that Harry was not at all popular with old man Busch who
as I understand it fired him and kicked him out of St Louis

I am not quite sure of the reasons but the old man was certainly
not enraptured by ole Harry

Bern ODell

I grew up listening to Harry Carey call the Cardinals games and
really liked himthen But as I recall he was fired because
he was too critical read honest when he was announcing He
dared to point out the Cards miscues and such At least this is
what I remember from when I was a kid
