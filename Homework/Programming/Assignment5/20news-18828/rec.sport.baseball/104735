Being an old time Cardinal Fannow relocated to the NVA areaI can
recall that Harry was not at all popular with old man Busch who
as I understand it fired him and kicked him out of St Louis

I am not quite sure of the reasons but the old man was certainly
not enraptured by ole Harry

  But maybe his wife was  

  I dont claim to know whether its true or not but a couple different
people totally unrelated have said Harry was relieved of his duties
because he had more than platonic relations with Augie Buschs wife
Judgement is left to the individual cuz I sure dont claim to be an
impeachable source in this case
