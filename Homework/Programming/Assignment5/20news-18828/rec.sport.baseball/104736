	The reason I bothered doing this DR stuff was to see if I could
determine the answer to the ageold question Is Jeff Blauser more
valuable than Rafael Belliard

Well it looks like just as Doug trumped Tim beating him to the net
with his defensive analyses so Tim has gotten in ahead of me

The way I was doing it was a little different Being me of course I
used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth
and I calculated both rate of performance fielding equivalent
average and total performance fielding equivalent runs But I
compared not to the average player but the replacement player and
heres why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the
system In the AL of 1992 the average SS is 329 runs above
replacement RAR cf 316 2B 288 3B 263 LF 260 RF 246
1B 169 We may quibble with the exact numbers but the order looks
substantially right

In the equivalent average I have always set league average to 235 I
had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of
180 the name of that replacement level hitter often as not is
Billy Ripken I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the
same distance from 235 as 180 but in the opposite direction as I
have set it up that makes for an eqa of 280 Yes I can add Runs
are proportional to eqa squared the difference between 180 squared
and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared and I rounded
off for simplicity An allreplacement fielding team would have
Randy Milligan at first 282 Willie Randolph 269 at second Leo
Gomez 279 at third Walt Weiss 269 at short Kevin Bass 271
in left HoJo 257 in center and Eric Anthony 277 in right Ugh

So the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and
fielding RAR I can rate them by total RAR or RAR per some number of
batting outs like 400 An average player has a total RAR of about 55
30 batting 25 fielding
