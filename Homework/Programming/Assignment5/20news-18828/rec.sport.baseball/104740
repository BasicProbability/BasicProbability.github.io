	Baltimore Baseblazers Where the hell did you come up with that The
Orioles are not a basestealing team except for Anderson Besides we would
never call them anything but the Baltimore Orioles Why The ballpark has
all these orthologically spelling error correct BALTIMORE ORIOLES all
over the place I bet you thought the bird is just an oriole Its not The
bird was named after Lord Baltimore when Maryland was founded Theyre
called Baltimore Orioles But the post is just a joke so why do I care what
a nonOs fan thinks of us But I still wonder where Baseblazers came from
San Diego Padres now theres a name that needs to be changed How is padre
being used As Father ie priest or father ie parents
