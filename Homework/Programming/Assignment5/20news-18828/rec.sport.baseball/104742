And finally Id like to point out that many high OBP guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them than because they have a great eye

Im not sure  I used to think this was true but more and more Im becoming
convinced that its the other way around among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot

Lets break down the four basic categories of hitter according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot


			Power			No Power

	Patient		Frank Thomas		Brett Butler
			Barry Bonds		Ozzie Smith
			Mark McGwire		Craig Grebeck
			Babe Ruth		Miller Huggins
			Ted Williams		Billy Hamilton
			Rickey Henderson	Eddie Joost
			Joe Morgan		Mike Hargrove
			   			   
			   			   
			   			   

	Impatient	Ernie Banks		Ozzie Guillen
			Dave Kingman		Shawon Dunston
			Joe Carter		Andres Thomas
			George Bell		Jose Lind
			Kirby Puckett		Devon White

Okay I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a
strike or two and try to get on base any way they can

So the No PowerImpatient guys have no excuse
The No PowerPatient guys are doing the right thing

Now the ImpatientPower guys how could you leave out the Big Cat
Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took
more pitches   Perhaps but I doubt it  If you tell Joe Carter
to go up there and take a few pitches he will draw more walks but
he also wont hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because
he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive

The PatientPower guys   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and
Rickey Henderson has a strike zone the size of Hitlers heart 
so they get their walks based on the small zone

Look at the other 5 guys Thomas Bonds McGwire Ruth and Williams  Wow
A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe
walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them
The pitchers would do better in my opinion by just coming after
them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch but pitchers
would rather nibble go 20 or 31 and then get hurt
