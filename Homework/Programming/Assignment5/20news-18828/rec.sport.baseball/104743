        If I were the manager Id argue that the runner was out of

Rule 709k states It is interference by a batter or runner when 
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base
 he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of
the foul line and in the umpires judgment interferes with the field
er taking the throw at first base

The key word in the rule is and A runner isnt out just for running
out of the baseline Hes out for interfering with the fielding of the
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first Because the catcher
opted to throw the ball over the batterrunners head theres no inter
ference



So what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw

The rule book certainly doesnt have a definiton or clarification so its
possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter
his throw to avoid hitting the batterrunner then again we have interference
You know it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justlyif the
catcher or the pitcher say Rob Dibble for example throws toward first
and hits the runner running inside the baseline the fielder takes the chance
of being ejected  Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or
your scenario above him

You should note that in our American Legion League which uses MLB rules we
interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference
per rule 709
