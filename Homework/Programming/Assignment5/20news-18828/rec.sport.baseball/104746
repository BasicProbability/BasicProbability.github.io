Subject Re How to speed up games marginally realistic

Pitchers are required to pitch or feint or attempt a pickoff
within 20 seconds after receiving the ball not 15

Pitchers are required to pitch their warmup throws within a
one minute time frame beginning after each half inning ends
not two minutes

And the reason why a reliever should be allowed warmups is
simple Different mound different catcher
