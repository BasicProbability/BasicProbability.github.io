1 why would owners decrease ticket prices when they obviously get
   lots of people to pay the price theyre asking
I dont think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing
to pay the price  Im sure someone out there in netland has some
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
sold  But even if the trends are relatively flat you have to consider
what is happening on a teambyteam basis

Attendance in 1992 was down By 3 From an alltime record in 1991
In people terms attendance was down by 310000 from 1991 to 1992 Two
franchises the Dodgers and Mets were down by 1100000 from 1991 to 1992
Had either of them not been entirely awful MLB would have set another
attendance record in 1992
