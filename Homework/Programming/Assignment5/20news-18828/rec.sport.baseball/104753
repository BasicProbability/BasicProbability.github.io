Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarragas
inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt
paid to walk or is an RBI guy or whatever

Alright thats enough Ive suffered with all kinds of insults as
typical for the net but give me a break Galarraga is currently
batting over 400 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing
enough walks  What would he have to do to please you guys bat 1000
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen
THEN I would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches My comment
that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes
batting 400 and leading the league in RBIs so what bloody difference
does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks Sheesh
