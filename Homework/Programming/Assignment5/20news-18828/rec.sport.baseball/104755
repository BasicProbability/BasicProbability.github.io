 HeyIve noticed that Luis Alicea is starting at 2nd for the Cardinals
 instead of Geronimo Pena  Is Pena hurt or was he just benched for poor
 performance  Anyone know

After a quick start Pena has been stuck in a rut  Torre gave Alicea
the start to try to get Pena out of whatever funk he is in  It has
worked in the past
