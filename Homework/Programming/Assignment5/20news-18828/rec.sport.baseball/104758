All of these divisions based on race religion etc make me sick
As they should  Isnt it nice that MLB is finally waking up to
their existence  Isnt it a shame that hiring practices on and off
the field have been discriminatory for so long  Quick name a
lighthitting black outfielder or 1B who lasted 10 years in the bigs
I bet you can name two dozen white ones
Otis Nixon
Darnell Coles
Henry Cotto

Manny Mota
Billy Hatcher
Herm Winningham
Lonnie Smith not light hitting but a horror in the field
Gary Redus
Dion James
Daryl Boston
Vince Coleman yeah hes finally started to have a decent OBP
Cecil Espy
Willie Wilson
Gary Pettis
Milt Thompson
Gary Varsho

OK I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook but
only after the first 7 or 8 Oh and theres the alltime lighthitting
black outfielder Lou Brock Look it up And Curt Flood Cesar Geronimo
Cesar Cedeno 

Note  These guys may not have reached 10 years yet but theyve got
to be close

Likewise for my list Oh and a prediction Milt Cuyler
