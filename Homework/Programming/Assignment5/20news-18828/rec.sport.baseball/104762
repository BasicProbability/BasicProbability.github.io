Why are we continuously putting down other universities Queens is not
as great as is makes itself out to be This place has only got a good rep
because its been here so long If someone would take the time to look around
and see how dissatisfied people are with the disorganization and the constant
misuse of the Bell Curve they could see that Queens needs some major
improvements I would personally start with hiring professors who can
actually teach not people who are here with the attitude that this place
would be okay if it wasnt for all the students running around

When did George Bell exBlue Jay learn to throw a curve
