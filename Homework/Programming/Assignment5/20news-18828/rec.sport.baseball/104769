2  Wade Boggs
    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot  But his career is 
    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop
    a long term solution ie Hensley Muelins Russ Davis Velarde
    Besides Wade just doesnt have any range  What a shame about
    Charlie Hayes huh

Actually according to the DA information posted by Sherri Boggs is superior
defensively to have  Heres their Defensive Averages for the last five
years compared to average at 3b AL

            1988        1989        1990        1991        1992
Boggs     6432    65947   55054   65333   63432
Hayes          60140   62218   60614   57428

If Hayes is a defensive standout at third hes done a good job in disguising
it  To put it another way compared to an average third baseman last year

Boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs turned 2 more double plays and
prevented 11 doubles

Hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits turned 6 more double plays and
prevented 4 doubles

  It is considered good to look wise especially when not 
   overburdened with information  J Golden Kimball
