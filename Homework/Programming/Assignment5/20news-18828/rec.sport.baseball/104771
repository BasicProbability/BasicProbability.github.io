I dont think it was that obvious at the time that Viola was better
Morris and Viola had comparable KIP ratios in 1991  Viola was coming
off an injury whereas Morris was healthy

At the time I didnt really want the Sox to sign either  I was more
than a little worried about Violas elbow

But you surely remember my shout of relief when after a week of
rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox they ended up with Viola
instead

Now Im even happier  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely

Also Morris was willing to sign for only two years
The Jays dont like to sign pitchers to longterm contracts which I think
is a sensible policy

How long did Viola sign for  Three years  I generally agree with
their policy of avoiding longterm contracts for pitchers  But I
think they enforce it rather too strictly  These days the premier
pitchers all sign three or four year deals  Which leaves the Jays
with Morris and Stewart  If the Jays want to compete for top free
agent pitchers they will have to accept greater risks

Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris  Are there any
automatic activation clauses  What is the buyout amountf

Cheers
