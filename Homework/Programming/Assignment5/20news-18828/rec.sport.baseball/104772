 I am not quite sure of the reasons but the old man was certainly
 not enraptured by ole Harry

   But maybe his wife was  

   I dont claim to know whether its true or not but a couple different
 people totally unrelated have said Harry was relieved of his duties
 because he had more than platonic relations with Augie Buschs wife
 Judgement is left to the individual cuz I sure dont claim to be an
 impeachable source in this case 

Among those who have said it well not quite SAID it but certainly
alluded to it is Bing Devine Redbird GM or some other administrator at
the time  I heard Bing speak about it at last years SABR National

BTW have we had a show of hands about who will be attending this years
SABR National in San Diego  Ill be there

Harry talks about this incident in his autobiography Holy Cow  
Unfortunately I can not clarify on this since 1 I read the book a couple
of years ago and 2 I do not have my book with me  

Anyway It is a pretty interesting book if you are a Harry or Cubs fan
