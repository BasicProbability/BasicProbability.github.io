   Another pair of suggestions
   1 Remove the Balk rule  It is the runners responsibility to stay safe
      no matter what the pitcher does

   2 If a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than X time X  3 to 5
      without successfully picking off the runner the runner advances a base
      as if walked

This last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably  Suppose the pitcher uses up N1 of his N pickoff
attempts  The runner can probably stretch his lead off the base
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time

Would this suggestion apply to pickoff attempts per pitch per
batter or per base runner on the same base
