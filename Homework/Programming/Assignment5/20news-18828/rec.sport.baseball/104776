Alright thats enough Ive suffered with all kinds of insults as
typical for the net but give me a break Galarraga is currently
batting over 400 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing
enough walks  What would he have to do to please you guys bat 1000
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team

Fine are you willing to bet that he will bat 400 the rest of the way

The point is that he has hurt the Rockies so far its that he will hurt
them eventually  Just as much as he hurt the Expos and the Cardinals the
past couple seasons

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen
THEN I would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches My comment

It has happened for the past 3 seasons where have you been

that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes
batting 400 and leading the league in RBIs so what bloody difference
does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks Sheesh

Well see come September  I have an outstanding bet with someone that
Galarragas OBP will be less than 300 on June 1
