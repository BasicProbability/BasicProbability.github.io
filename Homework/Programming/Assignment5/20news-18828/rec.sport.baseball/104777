  Does anyone else think that this weekends fourgame series was a
really strange one
 
yup I was wondering the whole time why the Braves most 
						    
talented outfielder Neon Deon was not starting  Heres 
  
	Whoa Arent you forgetting a couple of guys named Gant and Justice

a guy who can hit 300 20 hrs leadoff and steal 40
 
	He can lead off Hell probably steal 40 He might hit 300 Hell
never hit 20 homers I think you went 2 for 4 on this one
 
bases and they start guys like Nixon and Bream ahead
of him   I cant really see that advantage of Nixon
over Deon except that Nixon is a better defensive outfielder  
		       
	You said it all right there 

	Does anyone else out there not like Deon I think hes all hype
His 300 season last year was good but Im not convinced that he can do
it again It reminds me sorry of the year 1987 when Tim Wallach hit
30 or so homers and had 127 RBI It never even came close to happening 
again Of course maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business
and dont play it up for the attention Just my HO

Doug Roberts  Larry Walker is God Delino Deshields thinks he is
