Actually Im not sure that Philly won but they were ahead 27 in the bottom

of the eighth I was going to post the box score but since Cinci was playing
so criminally bad the pub I was at had to turn the game off

So heres whats up

Cincinnati had seven hits all singles by the end of the eighth  This makes
it six games with exactly ONE extra base hit

Cincinnati was 05 with runners in scoring position
Now if a team is going to be completely without power they absolutely
HAVE to hit in clutch situations

Cincinnati starter Tom Browning pitched 41 innings giving up 5 runs and 10 h
its
while striking out 5  He was surely the loser tonight
Reds starters while supposedly solid have won only one game this year
Of course the Reds have only won two

Cleanup batter Sabo went 04  Besides yesterdays homer hes SUCKED at the
plate

Dibble may not actually return Friday This may not mean anything since Cinci
may
not find themselves in a save situation for a while

Speaking of which The Reds have ha exactly one lead this week for oneand
ahalf innings after Chris dinger on Tuesday

Manager Tony Perez says the Reds are just not swinging the bat well right now
Good call Doggie

Well theres a big difference between just not swinging the bat well and
what the Reds are doing at the plateUUUGGGHHHH

  A Reds fan on the verge of a nervous breakdown

  Why is it that the prognosis on Kevin Mitchell is Out 23 days no matter
    what day you read it
                            Gary Burbank


  Ive told you before and Ill tell you again  The strong
   survive and the weak disappear  We do not intend
   to disappear
