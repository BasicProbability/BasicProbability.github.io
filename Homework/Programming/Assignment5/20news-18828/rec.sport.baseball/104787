I Love it how all of these people are blaming the Phillies success 
on a weak division  Why dont we look at the record of the teams in 
each division READ InterDivisional Play well see that the East 
is really kicking the shit out of the West  I know it is early but 
that is all we have to go on  Atlanta is just so strong with their 
188 BA Cincinnati is 27 coming off a sweep at Veterans Stadium in 
Philadelphia and Houston was swept in its first three games by the 
Phillies in the Astrodome  That my Western Division friends shows 
that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you 
think
 
  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  midseason Cmon the Phillies havent proved anything yet Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago They sucked They started having
  a good year but didnt get any respect until they actually won the
  division which is how it should be So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year not just a good 2 weeks they wont get any respect
  either BTW Atlantas 188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are Their record is 63 Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting 188 hahahaha And Atlantas hitting will
  improve dramatically  
  No Im not a Braves fan Just defending a good team
