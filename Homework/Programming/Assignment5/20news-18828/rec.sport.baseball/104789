Subject RBI RISP and SLG

Off and on over the last several months threads about RBIs and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can 
predict a players RBIs using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position RISP
that he bats with  In the Brock2 model Bill James calculated
predicted RBIs as RBI235Total Bases  Home Runs  This 
completely ignores the context which was all that Brock2 
could do since context was unknown to it  So I thought Id
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing RBIHome Runs to SLGRISP

Ive started with team data using data from the Eliass that
Ive picked up over the years when a I could afford them and
b I could stomach the thought of increasing Eliass profits
That gave me the years 19841986 1988 and 1990  I dont 
have team RBIs for 87 or I could add that year  If you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get 

RBIHome Runs  081SLGRISP

The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 086 which is
significant at a ridiculously high level  So I feel like the
fit is good at the team level  Ive no started to move on to 
the player level and have looked at 4 players Will Clark
Ozzie Smith Joe Carter and Don Mattingly  I hope to 
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year

It doesnt do too badly except the equation underpredicts the
low HR hitter Smith which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be Ozzie  The results

                           RBIHR
         Years        Actual   Predicted
Carter  848890     400       4026
Clark   87889092  269       2696
Mattly 848890     471       4608
Smith   848890     317       2806

I think we can make a case and I hope to make it stronger that
RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up
