Im no Kingman fan  Just thought Id point out that hes the
only player in history to have five threeHR games  Joe Carter
has four  Eddie Murray three  McCovey and Gehrig also three
Ruth Mays Foxx and Dawson two each


Didnt Mike Schmidt also do this at least three times  I can 
remember twice in Wrigley Field alonehe did it the same day
Kong did it in a 2322 shootout and he swatted four there one
day in April 76 the month he set the April record with 11 HRs
Anybody remember any of this  I was just a kid
