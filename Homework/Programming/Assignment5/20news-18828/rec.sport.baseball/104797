Most of the points you made about Lopez v BerryhillOlson have been
made by others and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of
Frank Thomas I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of
his supporters


Nope Theyre baseball management possible the most shortsighted 
collection of people in the nation Do you not believe this goes on
Mark Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
1990

See  This is essentially what everyone was doing    comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game  Im really looking forward
to seeing this cantmiss superstar now  As for Thomas I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 cant remember  But who did the Sox have at first
Calderon  Martinez  Kittle  The spot was there  The talent was
there  Sure I say go for it

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989 and I am not convinced that Olson
Berryhill are nearly as bad as KittleMartinez were

BTW I dont think Thomas was hurt by those three months





Or Cal Eldred wasnt really better than Ricky Bones last year

Well if we cant compare our guy to one of the best in the game
lets compare our decision to one of the most Boneshead right

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career  Frankly I dont know why he didnt
make the club in 1992  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a bigleague pitcher  No one   I repeat NO ONE  
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade  Though I guess
Mieske has a future

I take it back McIlvaine may have laughed louder



Youre mostly polite make defensible if flawed cases have wit and
have in the past admitted being wrong That does qualify you on rsb
Well make an SDCN out of you yet 


aw gee shucks  thanks guy  except I missed the part where SDCNs
admit theyre wrong
