Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the
BB DDD this year

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first
atbat this year went 394 feet if I remember right Ill have to check
my scorecard at home  I think thats the longest so far in the Kingdome
through the first stand five games there  A weak showing despite some
promising taterball candidates  Ben McDonald Rich DeLucia and the
rest of the Mariner bullpen  making appearances

Anyone have the tapemeasure value for Omar Vizquels grand slam in the
Skydome
