Subject Re Torre The worst manager

NoHal McRae is the worst manager in baseball  Ive never seen a guy who
can waste talent like he can  One of the best rawtalent staffs in the league
and hes still finding a way to lose  Ill be surprised if he makes it through
the next 2 weeks unless drastic improvement is made

Im confused  How is it Hal McRaes fault that he cant win with a team 
whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt  I mean lets be real  Kansas
City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end
up near 500 they have less offense than any other team in baseball even
if you count the expansion teams
