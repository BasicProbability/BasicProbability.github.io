One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorns Hidden Game is titled
Pitching is 44 of Baseball implying that fielding is 6  How do
they determine that  Beats me  its been a long long time since I
read it

This was my opinion the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game The
argument was

1 Defense or runs allowed is 50 of the game
2 Unearned runs amount to 12 of the runs allowed earned runs 88

3 Since unearned runs are the result of fielding not pitching and
earned runs are the product of pitching not fielding fielding is 12
of defense and pitching is 88 of defense
4 Caombining with 1 pitching is 44 of the game fielding 6

Pete is usually sharper than that My own feel is that fielding is in
the 2533 of defense range call it 3070 between fielding and
pitching

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning with the
split probably somewhere around 495 and 05

Id give baserunning a little more credit than that maybe 455 or
even 4010 Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats which wouldnt be that unreasonable and
even if you dont let Roberto steal a single base theyll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going firsttothird more often No offense
