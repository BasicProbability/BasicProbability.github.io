Since someone brought up sports radio howabout sportswriting

I happen to be a big fan of Jayson Stark  He is a baseball writer for the 
Philadelphia Inquirer  Every tuesday he writes a Week in Review column  
He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week  Unusual
stats  He has a section called Kinerisms of the Week which are stupid
lines by Mets brodcaster Ralph Kiner  Every year he has the LGTGAH contest
That stands for Last guy to get a hit  He also writes for Baseball 
America  That column is sort of a highlights of Week in Review  If you 
can check his column out sometime  He might make you laugh

Rob Koffler

Isnt Stark that idiot who writes in Baseball America   Twice a month he
writes a Who woulda thunk it article which is really the same piece
every time   Who would have thought that Buddy Biancalana would have
more home runs than the Colorado Rockies Babe Ruth Omar Vizquel and
Nolan Ryan COMBINED   Hes an idiot if its the same guy


 

You live day to day and                rkofflerux4csouiucedu
