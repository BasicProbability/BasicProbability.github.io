Can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make
absolutely no sense  At least in the local Gannett rag that finds its way
to my door  I must have stared at Cleman in the Mets box for a
good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was  Wouldnt
it make more sense to use Colemn

Ive seen it as Colmn also

Blame the Associated Press  After the official scorer balances the
official score card they copy it and give it to several diffent people 
One of those is a person from AP whose job it is to type it up using a
template on a laptop and transmit it to the AP offices in New York
Rockefeller Center via the telephone  The box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over APs news delivery services  If there are
corrections those are issued later  It is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at Shea or whereever whose fault that is  NOTE The AP
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one

Not totally true  For the past year or two the AP has been getting box
scores from STATS Inc  The AP representative in the press box is actually
a STATS reporter 25 dollars a game but free parking  And anybody can
do it  The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago some quick error 
checking is done and then STATS sends it to the AP  Im not sure where
the appreveiations come in hear  I dont think it is at STATSs  It may
just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day 

While Im mentioning STATS reporters they are always looking for new
people  Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh youre road
to getting into the press box may be real short  For more info call 
STATS 708 6763322 and ask about the reporter network  Its a fun
way to get paid for watching baseball games

End of public service announcement


Last week they were in Denver  Maybe the AP person in Denver did this
remember they just started with MLB out there  Check tomorrows
paper 421 and see if the person who is doing it from Shea does the
same thing
