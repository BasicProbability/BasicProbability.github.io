Yes I could look it up but I prefer to post this question 
to the net
I read somewhere in a long forgotten article that the handsignals 
used by major league umps were originally used to help a 
deaf ball player by the name of Dummy Urban myth True 
I gots ta know

	Dummy Hoy a late 19thCentury baseball player was deaf  In
order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or
strike the umpires developed hand signals  This also helped to relieve
the stress on umpires vocal cords so they didnt have to shout STRIKE
or BALL 350 times a game
	Heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book
John Thorn has ever authored A Century of Baseball Lore
