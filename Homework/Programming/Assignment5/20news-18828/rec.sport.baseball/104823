So Alfredo Griffin is better than Barry Larkin

If rings is what youre judging by then I dont see your point since Barry
has one 1990

Yes but Alfredo has at least two 1988 Dodgers and 1992 Blue Jays
Not only that he has won World Series rings for more different teams than
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig combined how do we know that the Yankee dynasty
was not due to Lazarri being at third 

	Warren I agree with your premise but The Babe won on
two teams Thats right he was part of the Red Sox Dynasty of the
1910s And everyone knows that the Yankee Dynsaty wouldnt have
happened without thier famous bullpen catcher whose name escapes me at
the moment

Cuz
