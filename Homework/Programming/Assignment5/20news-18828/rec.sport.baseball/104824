Subject Belcher terrific Tomlin not Reds win 50 RedReport 420

Tim Belcher pitched a dandy threehit shutout tonight as Cincinnati won 
their second straight 50  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and 
often by the heavily rightunbalanced Reds lineup which managed some
recently rare power with their bats

Belcher 11 was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the
game progressed  Early on he had several threeball counts but even those
were few and far between later on as he allowed only one baseonballs while
striking out nine  In a post game interview he said his changeup was working
for himI should say so  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 
breaking balls

Tomlin 01 on the other hand was in trouble early giving up a secondpitch
double to leadoff batter Bip Roberts  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and 
Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right  The big guys
Mitchell Sabo Milligan were unable to get anything after thatin fact
they all struck outbut Kelly managed a score anyway due to a doublesteal
and a Tomlin wild pitch

In fact it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky
start he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only
20  Randy Milligan though had different ideas as his lineshot was
poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple  Milligan would 
later score on Reggie Sanders sacrifice fly giving Cinci the 30 lead 
after 4

The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second
double of the game and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the 
left field line chasing Tomlin  Barry later would score the final run on
Tom Princes twobase passed ball  

The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the
fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit backtoback singles the second 
being of the bunt variety but Carlos Garcia struck out Prince fit a 
foul fly and pinchhitter Lonnie Smith Kd to end any Pittsburgh hope

Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well though  relievers Blas Minor
Moeller sp and Nagel gave up only two hits in their fourplus innings
work

Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he misplayed 
bruised his right thumb  He was taken to the hospital for precautionary
Xrays  Lets hope hes OK

Cincinnati is now 49 still the worst record in the majors but with the
two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar
Pittsburgh is now 76
