I agree with Nick  Whats the big deal about long games  If you want
to watch baseball theres that much more baseball to watch  And yes
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves

I dont really mind the length of games either  If they want to speed
the games up in sensible ways thats fine with me too  However what
I object to is the assertion by baseball people Whitey Herzog Buck
Rodgers are who Ive heard say this that games are too long because
hitters are taking too many pitches and that the strike zone needs to
be expanded
