 Before folks jump on me let me ask the net  would the Jays
 have won the AL with a good pitcher from AAA in place of Morris given
 his run support  How about an average ML pitcher  I cant believe
 that Morris performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
 impact on the Jays performance 

I know its very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris but lets give credit
where credit is due

It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris

Well when you say without Morris you have to mention an assumed
replacement  If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston
softtoss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days then
of course the Blue Jays wouldnt have won without Morris  If the
alternative was replacement level then I think it wouldve been very
close and yes Morris mightve made the difference  If the alternative
was Frank Viola the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with
Viola

Last year when the team went 1315 for the month of August and all the 
other starters were being shelled and Milwaukee was making a charge
Morris went 51 with a pretty good era I cant remember exactly

Yes  You can make the argument that the his presence prevented 
the team from collapsing in August

Also lets not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day  If he didnt help us win the AL east forget
about the pennent and the world series

Those innings were probably helpful

His run support was high 598 runs but so was Stottlemyers 590 runs
and he won only 12 games  I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of
65 and 86 ballgames but this is to his credit  He pitched only as good
as he needed to be  When he was up 61 in a ballgame he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
I hate this expression  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down  But Morris being a 
veteran pitcher knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball  By saving himself he was able to reach back for that little extra
I hate this too when the game was on the line

Well I think is complete bs  What happened most of the time is that
Morris fell behind and the team came back and rescued him  Mostly
this is because hes a lousy 1st inning pitcher and much better
the rest of the way  That the team can climb out of 40 50 holes
consistently and win them 65 is not to Morris credit its to the
teams credit

Furthermore while Morris did exceed the WL percentage that would
be projected from his runs allowed and run support he hasnt done
this in previous years  In fact his WL record in 1991 is a lot
worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed
Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992

Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in  Typical
Morris games  Morris gets behind team rescues him  Hes not
responsible for that rescue  And in both those games the team
just didnt rescue him enough  Jack Morris pitched as well as he did
during much of the season in those 2 games the offense just didnt
earn him a victory

BTW I think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a 
veteran pitcher which Cito would never do but his era is 17 how much more
can he be embarrassed

Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he cant start
anymore hes too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen
