First a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball

I definitely do  Thats why I dont like going to see games played
on artificial turf 

The lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches

And while its true that the gaps between plays can be interesting this
is only true when they dont become extralong

Well your idea of interesting differs from mine  I think
batting practice is interesting for example and make a special
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it  I think the
delaying tactics of batters pitchers catchers and managers are
interesting because theyre attempts to gain advantage through control
of the flow and timing of the game  Of course the umpires can and
should intervene when these tactics get out of hand  As Ryan Robbins
has pointed out there are rules that cover this

One of the more fascinating things about baseball I think is its
openendedness with regard to time  You never know if the game is going
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours or if its going to
go on until four in the morning  Likewise some games are actionpacked
and some games are slow and lazy  Thats fine by me  Those folks who
want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel
surf and cater to their short attention spans
