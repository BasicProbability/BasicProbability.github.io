Subject Pecota Braves

Could someone out there send me Pecotas stats for the last few years or
something to give me some sort of feel for what kind of player he is
My mind has no handle on him at all it bothers me  Pecota of the Braves
that is  Pretty meaningful that I cant even come up with his first name
I think
