	Does anyone else out there not like Deon I think hes all hype
His 300 season last year was good but Im not convinced that he can do
it again It reminds me sorry of the year 1987 when Tim Wallach hit
30 or so homers and had 127 RBI It never even came close to happening 
again Of course maybe I just prefer guys who go about their business
and dont play it up for the attention Just my HO

Tim Wallach can be explained with the rabbitball  Deion can be explained
as learning how to play the game  Im not betting that Deion will be able
to play as well as last year but I think the odds of Deion playing as well
or better than he did last year are better than the odds of Otis Nixon
doing the same thing  When you factor in defense Otis was more valuable last
year  But Im not convinced hell be more valuable this year and especially
next year
