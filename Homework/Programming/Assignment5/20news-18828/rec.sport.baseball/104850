Subject Re Opinions on Eli  Denny Show

So THATS what happened to Denny McLain  Sad

For those of you who are interested another baseball pariah
Pete Rose has a weekday radio show on the Sports and
Entertainment national radio network  I think its 35 PM
locally 68 PM on the East coast

And actually his onair monologues about the baseball
business sounds a lot more reasonable and articulate
than what I hear from the Ray Knights of the world

Greg Mockingbird Franklin   Interracial mixing encompasses a lot lot more
f67709907ccitarizonaedu      than mingling between G7 races  robohen

   Stodgy Things
     Argument by an inept speaker
     Ignorant sermonizing
     A drinking bout without hors doeuvres
     A driedup sword sheath held together by threads
     Questioning by a boy favorite about ones other affairs
