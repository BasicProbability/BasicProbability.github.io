                                           So many morons
rm                                                   and so little time 



	Cant we just stick this guy in the FAQ and stop responding to him
guys The last several flamewars with him have been pretty much identical
Could someone just collect all the articles from this one and simply
repost the entire block whenever he tries to start one Itd be simpler
Roger apparently is one of those embarassing specimens who enjoys flames
Why give him what he wants

	Oh Roger Youre dull very dull You should get a new act
