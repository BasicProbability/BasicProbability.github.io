	You are absolutely correct  Braves fans are nothing but a bunch of
bandwagoners  Correct me if I am wrong but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give
away a ticket to see the Braves playI  would bet my next paycheck that 80 of
the socalled Braves fans living outside of Georgia at the present time can not
name more than 3 players from their 1988 season

	John Smoltz Tom Glavine German Jiminez Dale Murphy Bruce Sutter
Pete Smith Rick Mahler Jim Acker Jim Break on Through Morrison Ron
Gant Andres Thomas Gerald Perry Ozzie The Aeneid Virgil Lonnie Smith
Jerry Royster
	Howm I doing so far
	NOTE  I am not a Braves funn

 On the other hand ask any
Cubs fan living anywhere in the United States to name 3 players from any given
year and 80 of them probably could

	On the other hand  II like the Braves much more than the
Cubs  And all I can name is Ron Santo Ernie Banks and Don Kessinger
from 1969 my favorite Cubbie season

	Granted the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park but
that does not mean they diserve the title Americas Team
	The only reason they are considered Americas team is because of Ted
Turner and his little TV station which broadcasts across the nation

	Right  Ive watched enough Braves games to know a great deal
of their players  I like many of their players  The only Cubs games I
get to see while living in New York are those against the Mets and they
put me to sleep because face it watching guys like Rick Sutcliffe and
Luis Salazar doesnt put me at the edge of my chairu

	Ill consider Toronto AMericas team before the Braves

	Actually I notice a lot of antiToronto sentiment here in the
States  Partly because of some of that postSeries arrogance thanks
in part to UpsideDown Flag dork posts partly because Roberto Alomar
is about as exciting as Swiss Cheese and partly because living in 
Baltimore during the winters Ive become so fond of Os fans especially
those who call in to Rex Barneys radio show that I have to side against
their most hated rivals
 
	GO REDS

	Sorry but METS is spelled with an M and a T
