Subject Re MVP 92 Revisited

Total Baseball which also tries to evaluate a players total offensive
and defensive contributions gives Barry Bonds a Total Player rating of
90 for 1992 Only one other player since Ruth attained that mark Cal
Ripken for his 1984 season Rounding out the top five offensive players
in the NL last season Sheffield 59 Sandberg 58 Van Slyke 53 and
Larkin 47

The top 5 offensive players in the AL in 1992 were E Martinez 48
Ventura 48 Anderson 45 R Henderson 44 and Thomas 44

In short Total Baseball says Bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons
ever in the games history  better than any year had by Mantle
Mays Williams etc If you disagree dont flame me flame the
writers of Total Baseball Also Martinez and Ventura are neck and
neck so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis which one
had the better year can be considered a tossup Thus Total Baseball
supports your choices of Bonds and Ventura as the MVPs of 1992
