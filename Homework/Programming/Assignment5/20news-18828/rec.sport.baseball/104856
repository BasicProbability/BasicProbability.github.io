To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely  that  player As team would have played better with player B
in their lineup  Sheer speculation  Impossible to ascertain

There are very few disciplines where 100 certainty is necessary to
state something as fact  Baseball is not one of them

Therefore I can say that I know Clemens was better than Morris last
year and Larkin was better than Griffin  No I cant ascertain this
I cant prove it  But Im not required to do so

And since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless
why dont you simply stay out of them

No Im not going to be cordial  Roger Maynard is a complete and
total dickhead  Send me email if you insist on details
