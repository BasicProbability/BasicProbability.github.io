 heres the hard working black players  none
 heres the lazy white players  mcreynolds

Now that time has passed what would the posts be like if Rickey were driving
his boat drunk killing himself and one of his teammates  What would people
say if Bonds drunk out of his skull smashed his car into a tree disabling
himself  say Willie McGee for the season  I can tell you  They would be
considered spoiled lazy say it niggers  

	This awfully presumptious of you to assume you can read our minds and
predict the future  What makes you so sure I would be thinking these things
What makes you think that theres not a lot of people out there dont think
Crews is a god  Anyone who is dead because of a mistake deserves sympathy be
it Crews Olin Bonds McGee Rickey or you or meWhy does it bother you so 
much that two dead white men are getting a little sympathy Would it make you 
feel better if we only mourned dead black baseball players

To beat a dead horse I seem to remember a fair amount of sympathy for 
some black fringe player named Roberto Clemente  And for Roy 
Campanella  And for Thurman Munson  And for just about anyone else 
who we may not even have liked as players but mourned for dying too young

Wiggins Alan

But thats besides the point  Im sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed  But they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions

Example  

How about Jose Canseco  He gets a couple of speeding tickets and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year  Two years ago  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity etc  

Meanwhile Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton and I didnt
read any sportswriter complaining about that  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstras character or Daultons intelligence for that
matter based on this incident

 
David M Nieporent     Only one thing wrong with theory
nieporntphoenix        Is stupid  Is stupidest theory I ever heard
