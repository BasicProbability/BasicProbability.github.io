If black players cant survive being mediocre or worse how can McRae
and Chamberlain be explained

Nobodys saying its a hard and fast rule  My point is that white 
players are likely to stick around longer if theyre mediocre

I went through TB III and made a list of 10year OF and 1B who were 
negative in both Adjusted Batting Runs and Total Player Rating  TPR
has some problems but its generally not too far off for a career
imho  All players who played most of their career after 1960 were 
considered

Here are A through I havent done the rest yet

Armas Bailor Balboni Bannister Beauchamp Beniquez Bergman Berry
Biittner Blair Bochte Bonnell Bosley Bradford L Brown Buckner
Cabell CCastillo Cater Cimoli Cline Clines Coles D Collins
Davalillo Dernier Dilone Gaston Geiger Geronimo Gosger Heep

A few black players there a lot of white and hispanic

Hmmmone questionHow do you differentiate hispanic and black
After all some people fall into both categoriesRafael Ramiriez
comes to mindand hed fit into this grouping also
oopshes not an OF1Balthough he is a lighthitting
utility player  Sorry about that  But Miguel Dilone would
qualify if I remember correctly

When I say black I mean USborn black people for the purposes of this
discussion  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947 and one 
team in the 50s signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did  

And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

Dont know  But remember this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only blacks  Our national history 
includes huge longterm global tensions regarding the black minority 
the hispanic minority while often discriminated against has never been
the object of national obsession

It might also be worth your while to subdivide the data into careers
starting at 10year intervals  I would think that your prediction
would be most true for careers starting in the 1960s and least true
for careers starting in the 1980s  Of course youd also have to
compare total ML racial percentages for the era in question

Absolutely  As I said before I expect that this effect is disappearing
But it certainly did exist and all out talk of TWGs and all that is 
not without some small reason

Im of the opinion that your point is less valid today than it was
25 years ago but I would be curious to see the data

Well theres the list  Go for it  Ill cull some more names as I go
I expect youre right btw

Roger
