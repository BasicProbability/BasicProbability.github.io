 In any case I think Viola would have made a better signing  Why
 Viola is younger and is left handed how many left handed starters does
 Toronto have

Well I agree that Viola is a better signing  However why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters  I just dont understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters unless there is a park effect eg Yankee Stadium

The answer is  theyre stupid  Seriously I think youre right
on the money Ive never understood the preoccupation with making
sure a rotation has lefthanded starters  The only time it makes
sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main
rivals is loaded with lefthanded hitters  Other than that I think
youre completely right
