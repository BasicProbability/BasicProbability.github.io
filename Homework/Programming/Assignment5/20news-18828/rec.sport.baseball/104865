All of these divisions based on race religion etc make me sick
As they should  Isnt it nice that MLB is finally waking up to
their existence  Isnt it a shame that hiring practices on and off
the field have been discriminatory for so long  Quick name a
lighthitting black outfielder or 1B who lasted 10 years in the bigs
I bet you can name two dozen white ones
Otis Nixon
Darnell Coles
Henry Cotto

Manny Mota

a Dominican
b not all that lighthitting  304 lifetime 315 or so in 196673
when he did most of his playing  
c Professional pinchhitter after that  Yes that also gives you
Jerry Hairston

Billy Hatcher

Beginning 10th year now

Herm Winningham

Good one

Lonnie Smith not light hitting but a horror in the field

Not the same thing  LOTS of people are bad OFs

Gary Redus

Not all that light either  750 OPS

Dion James

Not 10 year

Daryl Boston

10year this year

Vince Coleman yeah hes finally started to have a decent OBP

Not 10year  

Cecil Espy

Not 10year

Willie Wilson

Yup

Gary Pettis

OK

Milt Thompson

10year this year

Gary Varsho

Sixyear this year

OK I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook but
only after the first 7 or 8 Oh and theres the alltime lighthitting
black outfielder Lou Brock Look it up And Curt Flood Cesar Geronimo

Brock Coleman and Wilson were hotdog basestealers also Lonnie Smith
that seems to be a special class  CFs like Pettis and Wilson also get 
more of a break especially if they actually do field well  And Brock
wasnt all that bad a hitter either not until the end there when he 
spoiled his ifetime 300 BA

And again I suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time  But if
you look at the history of the last three decades there seems to 
be a clear racebased pattern by which utility players and platoon
players and lesser talents stayed in the ML far longer if they were
white

Cesar Cedeno 

Light hitting  199 HR 793 lifetime OPS mainly with HOUSTON
Also Latin btw

Note  These guys may not have reached 10 years yet but theyve got
to be close

Likewise for my list Oh and a prediction Milt Cuyler

Come back in 1999 and well partyHHHHH talk
