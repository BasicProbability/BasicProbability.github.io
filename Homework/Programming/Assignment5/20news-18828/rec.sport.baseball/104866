Quick name a
lighthitting black outfielder or 1B who lasted 10 years in the bigs
I bet you can name two dozen white ones
Otis Nixon

Stole 300 bases  Ok hes still lighthitting but baseball managers dont
think so they think he like Omar Moreno before him is a perfect leadoff
man  Awesome defense

Darnell Coles

Hes still around because of his 1986 when he hit 20 HR

Henry Cotto

Hasnt played 10 years in the bigs  Wasnt a fulltime majorleaguer
until 1988

Manny Mota

Consistent 300 hitter

Billy Hatcher

Well see if hes still around in 1994 for his tenth year

Herm Winningham

Same goes for Herm

Lonnie Smith not light hitting but a horror in the field

Doesnt count then

Gary Redus

Redus is hardly lighthitting plus he stole 300 bases  Close to
800 OPS career against LHP

Dion James

Well see if hes still around in 1995 to qualify

Daryl Boston

Slugged 416 to 440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters
parks in the NL  Hes going to be one of Colorados better players this
year  Plus to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in Denver
and Buffalo and Hawaii while with the White Sox

Vince Coleman yeah hes finally started to have a decent OBP

Coleman assuming he makes it to 1994 was never perceived as being
weak offensively though of course he was  Led NL in SB his first six
years in the majors

Cecil Espy

Well see if hes still around in 1997

Willie Wilson

Wilson has always been overrated but hit 300 five times in a sixyear
stretch and led the league in triples five times  But we can count him
if hes still playing in 1994 though itll be because hes Otis Nixon
deluxe with slightly worse defense

Gary Pettis

Okay if hes in the league this year he can count though hes also
in the majors because of Otis Nixon syndrome

Milt Thompson

Hes not spectacular but hes neither lighthitting nor a tenyear man

Gary Varsho

Halfway there and unlikely to make it 34 of the way there

OK I admit to taking a quick browse through the Major League Handbook but
only after the first 7 or 8 Oh and theres the alltime lighthitting
black outfielder Lou Brock Look it up And Curt Flood Cesar Geronimo
Cesar Cedeno 

Brock suffered from Otis Nixon disease but he wasnt perceived as
lighthitting  Neither was Curt Flood  Cesar Cedeno was not light
hitting

Note  These guys may not have reached 10 years yet but theyve got
to be close

Likewise for my list Oh and a prediction Milt Cuyler

Hell have to steal a lot more bases
