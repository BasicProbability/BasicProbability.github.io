 Hey Valentine I dont see Boston with any world series rings on their
 fingers  Damn Morris now has three and probably the Hall of Fame in his 
 future  Therefore I would have to say Toronto easily made the best 
 signing  And dont tell me Boston will win this year  They wont 
 even be in the top 4 in the division more like 6th


In spite of what all the STAT heads say Jack Morris played a large role in
the Jays winning the World Series last year I dont care if his era was 4
he played a leadership role and did win 21 games His ERA may have been high
but he did pitch many outstanding ball games

And he pitched many notsooutstanding ballgames too

Jack essentially pitched a lot of 500 ball last year  This certainly
isnt irrelevant and iif you replace Morris with replacement level quality
the Blue Jays might not win

Re leadership I dont see it  If the leadership effect is there for
a starting pitcher you would expect to see its primary effect on the
pitching staff  You would expect to see the rest of the staff improve
Instead the rest of the staff declined

You can make a reasonable argument for Winfield providing leadership
the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous
year Im not saying I buy that but at least that argument makes
internal sense
