The Toronto Blue Jays scored 329  Oh fine well ignore that one coming from
1981 and all

Thatll teach me not to qualify my statements

In 1978 the Oakland As scored a thundering 532 runs  Bleah

OK something to shoot for  The Royals will score 531 runs or less
this season although they just decided to get McRae out of the
leadoff spot  

Of course Valentine will throw this one back in my face when the
Royals even manage to outscore another AL team
