Does anyone know the status of Jeffries or Arocha
 
 
Arocha broke his finger trying to field a ground ball   
He was put on the DL after the game and may require surgery

The injury is to his fielding hand which is good  Unfortunately he may
have some ligament damage and may require surgery which would lay him up
for a while

I dont know about Jefferies

Apparently just a strain of some sort  He hasnt been put on the DL so
its probably just daytoday
