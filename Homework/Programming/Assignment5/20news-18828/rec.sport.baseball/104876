As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him the 
netstatmavens will probably tell you theres no reason that it
should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling
prophecy

I dont understand  If it is Williams lack of ability which you say
above and I agree with which causes him to swing at bad pitches how
will thinking that Bonds hitting behind him will help him to stop
chasing bad pitches

I didnt mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that
specific deficiency  I meant that if having Bonds bat behind him
gives Williams possibly unfounded confidence that might translate
into more hitting productivity  But youre right  if Williams
biggest problem is more physical than mental thats less likely
to make a difference
