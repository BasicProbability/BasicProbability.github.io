You simply cannot show up an umpire like Ron Gant did  It is disrespectful
of not only the home plate umpire but of the dignity of the game

But of course it is expected that umpires will show up players

Dont get me wrong I understand the nature of the game but I just 
believe that a little egoectomy for the umpires would make the game 
much better
