Of course this is not the same as claiming as some do that Galarragas
inability to defer gratification isnt hurting his team because he isnt
paid to walk or is an RBI guy or whatever
Alright thats enough Ive suffered with all kinds of insults as
typical for the net but give me a break Galarraga is currently
batting over 400 and you guys are complaining that he isnt drawing
enough walks  What would he have to do to please you guys bat 1000
You can hardly claim that he is hurting his team

It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average Yes the
April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a 422 batting average
and a 413 OBP Thats on 19for45 hitting with 0 zip nil nada walks
The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that hes has a long history
of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability except for
drawing walks If he hit 400 for say even 250 ABs Id be convinced that
there was a real change in his ability If he did it with an OBPAVG Id
not only be amazed but Id make a bet that that would be a unique feat in
the history of the game But what do 45 ABs prove Look at some of the
other fluke players at this point in the season
  Player    AVG AB
  Blauser  367 49
  Grace    391 48
  Milligan 400 35
  Conine   375 40
  Lansing  400 50
  Slaught  406 32
Are any of these guys really that good Well in a word no How significant
is Galarragas average At the 45 AB level a hit is worth about 020 If
hed had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good
defensive play hed be in the 380 range If he goes 0for4 in his next
game hes all the way down to 388 In one game Come back in June Lets
talk then

If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs as someone speculated might happen
THEN I would agree with you that he isnt taking enough pitches My comment
that he isnt paid to walk doesnt mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs its more along the lines of hes
batting 400 and leading the league in RBIs so what bloody difference
does it make if he isnt drawing  a lot of walks Sheesh

Its history Greg Andres history is that he doesnt walk much because he
swings at bad pitches so his average isnt very good 45 ABs doesnt mean
an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand especially when
theres ample evidence 0 BB in 1992 that his basic hitting approach hasnt
changed Yeah he might suddenly have turned into a 400 hitter who never
walks but dont bet the rent money on it
