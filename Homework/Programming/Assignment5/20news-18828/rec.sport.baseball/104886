 Well thanks to Matthew Wall the Major League baseball logos which Ive been
 posting over the past number of weeks now have a home at the Internet
 Baseball Archive
 To get them FTP to eucalyptusccswarthmoreedu login anonymously as per
 usual and cd to the baseballmiscgraphics directory  Both the GIF files
 and the uuencoded versions are available

  People who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves   
  where it came from in the first place                                      


I have successfully copied all of the uuencoded versions of these logos to my
local directory but when I tried the GIF files it said Permission denied
Could you explain why and also how to execute the uuencoded files

Thanks

Ken
