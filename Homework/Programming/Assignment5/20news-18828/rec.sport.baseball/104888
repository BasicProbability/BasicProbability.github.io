I didnt say that pitchers fear of throwing strikes to guys like
McGwire Bonds and Frank Thomas was rational  
I just said that it exists

But why McGwire and not Carter  I can see some justification for Bonds or
Thomas because they tend to have higher batting averages but the major
difference I see between McGwire and Carter is that Carter doesnt draw
walks  Why arent pitchers afraid to throw strikes to Carter
