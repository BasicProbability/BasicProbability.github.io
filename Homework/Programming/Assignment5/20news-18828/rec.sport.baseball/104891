During spring training I made a similarly innoncentlooking comment 
about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying  no such
thing as clutch hitting they the SDCNs all screamed  I assumed
they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance
given their comments  Im still licking the wounds but I do have
a rebuttal planned      gotta do my homework as they say

some deletions
       Rather they showed quite convincingly that
	past clutch performance has never been able to predict FUTURE
	clutch performance

Im sure you are convinced Dave  Apparently so is Tony Perez
I however am not


I believe at the time of the Sabo plate appearance that Juan Samuel
was on the bench available for pinchhit duty  Over the past four
seasons

		NonClutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA

Sabo		1539	452	294		259	59	228
Samuel		1564	383	245		278	83	299	

I do not claim that this is a complete statistical analysis that
proves the existence of clutch hitting or compelling testimony that
Samuel would have gotten a base hit  Im sure there is something wrong
with the sample size or that the basic assumption that clutch
performance is random invalidates any conclusions from this limited
application  Or something or other  I dont pretend to understand
statistical analysis


Well we agree on the last part  One of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a players performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year  A 
players batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year
A players ability to walk or infielders Defensive Average are correlated
better  That is to say given their past performance in those statistics
we can have a pretty good handle on how theyll do next year  Put in 
some simple information about aging and you can do even better  One of 
the basic problems with something like clutch batting average  overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero 
Adding to the sample size doesnt seem to help much  As a counterexample to 
what you showed consider the following two players from 19841987

               NonClutch                      Clutch
               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA
 
Maldonado      1060    260     245            254     78      307
Lemon          1643    457     278            256     57      223

If you had had these two players in 1988 by your logic in those clutch
situations youd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye  Well in 
1988 Maldonado hit 267 in nonclutch and 190 in clutch while Lemon
hit 254 in nonclutch and 313 in clutch  Before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data there were 96 players who had 25 clutch
at bats every year from 19841988 according to Elias  As a simple
measure of clutchness lets just look at clutch BAnonclutch BA If you use 
8487 to predict 88 for those 96 players youd find that 27 of the
96 were below league average in that measure both in 8487 and in 88
26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were 
above in one and below in the other  If you were just flipping coins
youd expect to get 24 abovebelow in both and 48 that switched  The
difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment
is not statisically significant

BTW correlating players overall batting average from 8487 with
88 gives a correlation coefficient of 059 which is significant at
something better than the 999 confidence level  Correlating their
clutchnonclutch BA for the same period gives a correlation of 
0088 significant at no level of any interest



       Everyone would agree I hope that a grand 
	slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three
	is a VERY clutch hit  There is just no way to predict who is more
	likely to get the clutch hit based on past performance hitting in
	clutch situations


If you say so Dave  No way          


Actually its technically incorrect to say that we cant predict future
clutch performance  Its more correct to say that we cant predict
future clutch performance with any skill
