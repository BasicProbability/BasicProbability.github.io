Does anybody in the Pittsburgh area know why Mike LaValliere was released
Last year I kept saying that Slaught should get the bulk of the playing time
that he was clearly the better player at this point but Leyland insisted on
keeping a pretty strict platoon  And now he is released  That doesnt
make any sense to me

    The story goes like this

       Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didnt want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely

Well my question still hasnt been answered if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year why did he get so much playing time last year  Yes I know
he was part of a platoon and thats why he got more playing time than
Slaught but that doesnt answer the question  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year wasnt this also obvious last year and shouldnt he
have been taking away some of Spankys playing time against righties
