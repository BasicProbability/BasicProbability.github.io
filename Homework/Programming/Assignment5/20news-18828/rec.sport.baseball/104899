Subject Re Jewish Baseball Players

In article mssC5K47zFurnetcomcom mssnetcomcom Mark Singer writes


Polish and Jewish are not mutually exclusive


I didnt mean to offend or anything Im just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN and the interviewer cant remember who asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he the interviewer was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers To which Stanky replied Im Polish not Jewish

So maybe that wasnt the most PC thing for Stanky to say and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax Greenberg and Blomberg
