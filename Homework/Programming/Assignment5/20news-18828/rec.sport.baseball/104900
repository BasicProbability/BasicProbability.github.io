One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasnt
yet been addressed  I believe the rule also does not deal with this
situation

However if the Infield Fly is not caught at what point can a runner
legally leave his base wo fear of being doubled off for advancing too
early  

	The runner can leave his base at any time  If the ball is caught
hes got to tag up  If it isnt caught he doesnt have to tag up at
all  So if hes feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up  If it isnt caught hes probably scored
a run  If it is hes probably headed for AAA  

	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out
thereby removing the force on the runners on base  All other rules apply
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up
