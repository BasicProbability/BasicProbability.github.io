Subject Bonds vs Maddux

Ive been following the Giants closely over the offseason  newspapers
notesgroup etc  but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year Barrys swing was 
very impressive  hes very quick and his swing seems effortless even
compared to Clark particularly Clark as of late

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well  Im not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits 1b 2b hr for 5 rbis

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better  Claytons defense has been superb
McGee seems to like leading off this year  Manwaring is driving the ball
So on  so forth

I hope it continuesI think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for realparticularly the pitching

For myself I think the fresh start of MagowanBakeretc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year
