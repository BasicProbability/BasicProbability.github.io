Subject Yankee Bullpen  HELP


Buck Showalter just cant win 

Bob Wickmans pitching the game of his life through eight innings Yanks
lead 61 so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game Wickman manages to get two outs but in between four funs score
and all of a sudden its 65 and Wickman just cant get the third out
So Buck goes to the bullpen and Farr gets out the first guy he faces

Last night Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life this guy just keeps getting better through eight innings Yanks
lead 40 This time Buck thinks I dont want a repeat of that
nearfiasco with Wickman so Ill give my bullpen some work Steve Howe
whose ERA was 5400 coming into the game left with it at 8100 He didnt
do too good Then Farr comes in He gives up a tworun homer and the
Royals win it 65

Whats going on This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead Farr  Howe have done it twice together
Monteleones done it once and I think even Habyan did it once Whats the
deal We finally have terrific starting pitching so all of a sudden our
bullpen turns to shit

Whats Buck gonna do And whats George gonna do if this continues to happen
