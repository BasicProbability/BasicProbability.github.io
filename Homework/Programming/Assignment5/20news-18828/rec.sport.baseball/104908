  2 Astros relief corps holding together  If Doug Jones keeps his changeup
     effective and Xavier Hernandez can be effective then its passable
     Theres no reasonable lefthanded help and the middle relief is iffy
     Tom Edens was expected to take over the Joe Boever setup man role but
     hes been injured and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway  
     Houston thought that Boever would demand too much money so they let him
     go  Doug Jones can lose his touch  he went from Clevelands allstar
     closer to the minors in a pretty short span

  From what I understand Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
                                      
club  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houstons success  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West 
No argument at all with Murphy  He scared the hell out of me when he came in
last year  On the other hand the club though enough of Boever to put him into
an awful lot of games he may have led the league in appearances  he did at
least at some point  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy  but I guess
thats not considered that crucial by the club  I can just remember two years
ago so well though

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far  Biggio and Finley just arent doing their job of getting
      on base  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finleys job  Biggio concerns me since he usually
      starts the season very strong

Im not that concerned  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the
years and they have no good reasons to decline no injuries not old 
I expect them to come through just fine  Its those guys that have not
been consistently good that are the worrisome part even if they are coming
through right now
                                     

     On a side note are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next years uniform  There is talk that their road uniform will be
blech traditional grey with the word HOUSTON written across the
chest  If Im not mistaken their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange shiver  McLanes favorite color is red so

This sounds like their old road unis  Pretty dull  Buttons or pullovers
Ill check through my uniform book to see if theyve always had some orange

     Im really upset the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible  Id like to see the uniform of the mid1980s return  They
may not have been pretty but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball  and I liked it

Well well see  Ive got a Astros pullover shirt with the Astros stripes
across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public  i
can see why they might want that to change  Gee if they eliminate the
orange will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section what
used to be the gold and yellow levels  I dont know those numbers they use
now

I saw a pinstripe version of an Astros cap and I actually thought it looked 
good
