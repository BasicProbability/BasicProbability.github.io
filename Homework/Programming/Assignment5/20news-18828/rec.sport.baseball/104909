 Didnt Bob Horner go straight from Arizona State Univ
 to the Atlanta Braves I remember he had one great
 month hitting dingers and then the next I heard
 he was in Japan

 A month  Well he did have a short careercompared to what one might
 have expected for such a highly touted prospectdue to being injury prone
 overweight and having no work ethic  But he certainly did not
 suffer from being rushed to the bigs


Sorry Len this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs
Being overweight and having no work ethic leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose might have been corrected in Richmond  Did you intend a 
smiley after your comment


If I remember correctly Which is always in doubt Horners signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St for one more year if he hadnt
signed  Anyhow the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once
it lead to a weeklong walkout  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted and minor league play wouldnt have helped
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML and it did
keep him there for a while until he started falling on his wrists



Eric too lazy to update his sig Roush
