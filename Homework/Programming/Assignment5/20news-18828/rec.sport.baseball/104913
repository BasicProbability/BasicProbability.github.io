Subject Re When Is Melido Due Back

When are the Yankees planning on activating Melido Perez  His 15 days on
the DL are up today but are they bringing him back this weekend 

Thanks for any info
 


The Chicago Tribune pitching form has Perez pitching today 416  But
given the way that Buck changes his rotation so often that could just be
the work of a confused statpage editor
