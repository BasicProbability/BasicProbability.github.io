 Id say you could make a good for them being about equal right now TP
 rated Baerga higher actually

Finally an objective source  Alomars a great player but so is Baerga
Nice to see the objective source cited rather than my dads bigger than
your dad posts

I know  You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar
to Baerga must be a JayLover and IndianHater  Sorry you got that
one wrong  I hate the Jays and dont care one way or the other about
the Indians  But objectively Alomar had the better offensive year
last year so I have to pick him

You admit TP as a reliable objective source  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense

Thats a joke  Alomar might not be a goldglover but hes certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively
