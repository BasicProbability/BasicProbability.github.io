Subject Re Best Homeruns

I havent been following the previous HRs  But there are two that I saw
live that would have to be up there up where there  
1 Rick Mondays HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981
It was hit off Steve Rogers who is a RHP and primarily a starter
Why was he used as a reliever when the Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen  Considering Monday couldnt touch LHP
Lee would have been a safe bet  He wasnt even doing any drugs at that
time or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into 
Montreal  The blast wasnt the important aspect  It was the timing
Seventh game a tie game and in the top of the 9th  The Expos almost
came back though
2 Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980  So close yet so
far
and
3 Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago  It went off the technical ring in the Big O  It almost left
the stadium  That was hit HARD
