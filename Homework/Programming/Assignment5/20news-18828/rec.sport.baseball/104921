WHO THINKS THE ASTROS ARE GOING PLACES
THEYRE CURRENTLY FIRST PLACE
THEYRE 54 51 ON THE ROAD 
 
I AGREE LUMBERJACK except that theyre in 2nd  They ARE going PLACES 
San Diego Los Angeles San Francisco Cincinnati Denver Atlanta Miami
Philadelphia New York Montreal Pittsburgh Chicago St Louisand
points in between  
 
But
THEYRE 03 AT HOME

But
 THEY FACED THE PHILLIES  A TEAM THAT GOT OFF TO AN 81 START


 
Im just not used to an overly enthusiastic Houston fan  I really shouldnt
discourage it so HANG IN THERE LUMBERJACK  But get ahold of that shift
key will ya
 
ObBase  Apparently the new owner Drayton McLain sp doesnt particularly
like excuses  An item in our paper the Austin AmericanStatesman  If you
read it here it was somewhere else first said that he wouldnt take 
injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been
accounted for  Uh oh  I dont want an owner thatll keep everybody on
edge  Id never gotten that feeling about him but who knows  Does 


  To be honest I think the city of Houston loves the new owner  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions  players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros  I dont
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesnt know a whole lot about baseball
McLane is a businessman and doesnt like excuses  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldnt be an excuse to this club  Look at the depth of the
bench this season Canadele can play 7 positions Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too Uribe is nice to have as well  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters  Were dealing with a young
Houston team so injuries shouldnt play a big role  The only threat is
the bullpen  if Jonesy goes out we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season there is less pressure on the pen
