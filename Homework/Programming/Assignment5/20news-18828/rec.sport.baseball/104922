Id have to say the most impressive HRs Ive ever see came from Dave Kingman
and his infamous moonraker drives

I remember one he hit circa 1976 at Wrigley Field that went across
the street in dead center field and hit a house on the roof  He
whiffed a lot but when he did connect watch out

My favorite was the Barry Foote homer that bounced on Waveland and through
a second floor window across the street  Second though would be the Kong
drive that was last seen bouncing down the street that dead ends to the 
park at Waveland
