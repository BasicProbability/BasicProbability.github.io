 Last year the American League scored 9802 runs in 1134 games for a
 total of 86 runs per game with 10 HRgame  Through Tuesday the AL
 has 477 runs in 48 games for a total of 99 runs per game and a
 total of 17 HRgame  In 1987 there were 98 runs per game and 23
 HRgame
 
 The big question How significant is this  Have we returned to 1987
 Or is this just a minor abberation
 
 Some thoughts
 
 d I thought offense was generally down in April rising as the
 weather got warm and pitchers got tired  This may be a bigger
 abberation from the norm than it seems
 
 1 I dont get a feeling that the weather has been an issue this year 
    There doesnt seem to be a really cold spell in North America which 
    does makes it harder to hit not to mention making the ball carry less

You obviously did not watch the Twins in Chicago

No cold spell  Its been snowing most of the week in Minnesota
5 inches in Duluth last weekend

 I would still put things under the too early to tell category  

Yup
