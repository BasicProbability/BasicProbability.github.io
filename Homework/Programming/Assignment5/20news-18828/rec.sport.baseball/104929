 Not clear to me at all  Id certainly rather have a team who was winning
 41 games than 21 games  In the 21 game luck is going to play a much
 bigger role than in the 41 game 

But you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to
one run

Not if youve scored four runs you dont  Why strain even the best pitching
staff  Why not make it easier for them  

In the 21 game the best pitching staff in the world cant compensate
for a blown call a bad hop a gust of wind  Winning close is the 
wrong way to win both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot 
yourself are insurance against the Shit happens aspect of baseball

Not every great teamhas even good pitching  The Big Red Machine of
the 70s was leagueaverage in pitching  But somehow RoseMorganBench
Perezetc managed to win 100 games more than once peaking at 108
