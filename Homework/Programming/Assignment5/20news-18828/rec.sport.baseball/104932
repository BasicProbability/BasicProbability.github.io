     Hi baseball fans So what do you say Dont you think he deserves it
I

mean heck if Dave Winfield hohum is seriously being considered for it
as

is Lee Smith ha then why dont we give Dave Kingman a chance Or Darrell

Evans Yeah yeah After the Hall of Fame takes in them it can take in
Eddie

Murray and Jeff Reardon

Um what  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a long time

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years and excellently
on several occasions  

Dave Kingmans best year was like Darryl Strawberrys typical
year with the Mets  

Darrell Evans too did a whole lot more than just hit homers which 
is all that Kong did  

     Well in any case I am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody
giving

Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards
marginal

Whom are you talking about  Yes Eddie Murray is marginal but thats
because hes 38 years old  He wasnt marginal for a long time

Honestly Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there Theyre both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time Big deal

Not  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago in case you hadnt 
noticed

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder

     Lets be a little more selective huh Stop handing out these honors
so

liberally Save them for the guys who really deserve it Face it if

Like whom  There are many players in the Hall who arent anywhere near
as goos as the guys youre running down

something
isnt done there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore When

Thats already the case by some standards  But the bad players in the 
Hall are all from the 20s and 30s  Recent picks have generally been
excellent

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
candidates the absurdity is apparent Gee can these guys even compare to
the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan

No but who cares  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth
Not really  But he obviously belongs there

The Hall has generally had about the top 1 of major leaguers  As 
more players come through the game more will be in that top 1  

And yes its pretty easy to argue that Smith Yount Evans Winfield
etc are in the top 1  Dave Kingman on the other hand was a liability
throughout most of his career

Of course Garvey hasnt gotten a lot of HOF press so I dont know
what you mean  

As for Ryan is his WL better than Morris  Thats what a lot of voters
tend to look at  And Morris was awfully good for a decade and doesnt
lead MLB history in walks allowed either
