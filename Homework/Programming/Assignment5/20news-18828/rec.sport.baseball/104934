Which reminds me yet again of a BucsCards game in Whitey Herzogs
last year as Cards manager  Karen and I were watching the game on TV
and for some barely explicable reason the camera kept dwelling on The
White Rhino himself at his uniformfilling worst  Truly horrible

	Do you remember Game 7 of the 1988 NLCS after the Dodgers defeated
the Mets and Ughadugh fooboo fat stomach Tom Lasorda came running out
on to the field in celebration  YUCK
	He undulated  His arms flew up and down keeping time with his
rolling set of 9 stomachs which flew all around the cozy confines of
Chavez Ravine  He oozed like a white gastropod  He ran  It was a 
disgusting sight  Not only couldnt I watch my Mets in the Series I had
to watch Fat Stomach Lasorda roll around Dodger
	BLARGH

But what made it memorable was what Karen eventually said about this
which was

I would rather sleep with a jar of Bill Landrums spit under my pillow
 than look at Whitey Herzog in one of those uniforms

	If you like short fat men who grunt curse and spit a lot
Whiteys certainly your man  Former WFAN host Pete Franklin on The White
Rat 
	But its true this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in
tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary 
physique  Looking at Charlie Houghs scrawny torso through those tight
white shirts just sort of makes me decide Hmmm I dont want to eat lunch
todayor tomorrowor anytime soon
	When Al Harazin first became Mets GM he was asked if he intended
to help redesign the Mets uniforms and change their image  In particular
they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the 
sides the uniforms  He said that hes very much in favor of keeping them
because theyre sleek and theyre sexy
	Sid Fernandez in a tightfitting uniform with a sleek racing
stripe to denote speed and potencty  Mmmmmmmmlard
	Kevin McReynolds diving after a fly ball  MmmmmmmmMan O War baby
	Pat Howellwell never mind  Nothing could be tight on him 
They dont make uniform sizes that small  

Adam Wishes he contribute something more interesting to rsb Levin
