Subject Re Why is Barry Bonds not batting 4th

Some evidence that is NOT working

Take a look at the standings Its REAL easy to get so focussed on 
minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place If its
working you dont SCREW IT UP by changing things just because you think it
ought to be different

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details I prefer to watch teams
win When the Giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order Until then I think its stupid to focus on whats wrong
for the simple fact that ITS WORKING AS IT IS

PS  Does the mailing list maintainer think that Will Clark is the best 
first baseman in the majors and that Matt Williams is a better power hitter
than any other ballplayer

In the majors I dont follow AL so I wont comment on Majors In the NL
if I had my choice of any 1B in the league for my team itd be Clark and
Id hit him third My fantasy team has both Grace and Murray on it because
Ive never been able to GET Clark Id take any of the three without
hesitation in real life but I think Clark is it

Williams Not even close I much prefer his defense but when he isnt
headcasing it Matt has a good solid swing and some real punch If he drops
to 230 then he wanders out of cleanup but according to the latest
Baseball Weekly hes hitting 275 and in the last week hitting 296
Thats not exactly chopped liver

Mostly though the Giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues its rather silly to secondguess their strategy But evidently
some folks would rather be right than be first
