I think Sac flies are the only way OBP can be below BA


Does this seem dumb to anyone else
The fact not the comment

Why should a batters OBP be hurt by a sac fly  Especially if sac
bunts dont have the same effect since they do the same thing
but sac flies usually score a run while bunts just advance a base

But both of these situations involve the batter giving up an AB for
the benefit of the team sacrifice  So why should it hurt their
stats

The sac bunt is a purposeful act ordered by the manager  
The batter does not go up trying to get a sac fly and the
evidence available indicates that there is no such ability 
players cant will themselves to hit sac flies they fly out
to the same place just as often when theres nobody on third

Sorry I gotta disagree here  Last time I played ball I went up on
several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the
runner from third or advance a runner to third  Its relatively easy
actually you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to
hit a good line drive  With fastballs its very easy much more
difficult with good breaking balls  A good hitter with excellent bat
control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least oh 60
of the time

You havent been facing major league pitching      

  Maybe more you have to be good at the plate and most
of those guys are just as likely to opt for getting the base hit and
helping their average as getting the sacrifice  The best example I know
of is Jerry Willard in the 91 Series against Minnesota  All he had to
do was put one in the OF and the game was over  He swung waaaaaay past
parallel and accomplished barely getting the run in safely

STATS did a little study in the 1993 Scoreboard book entitled Can
you hit sacrifice flies on purpose  A summary of the findings

Over the 5 year period sacfly type fly balls were produced 176
percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful and 
177 percent of the time when a sac fly wasnt useful

They looked at the leaders in sac flies and found that the leaders
in sac flies  in other words the guys you would expect to be good
at it it  hit sac fly type fly balls only 3 more often when they
needed to  a difference way too small to be the result of a skill
Essentially the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do
so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often with and without
a runner on third

STATS concludes So it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit
sacrifice flies on purpose  even if they practice in the bATTING
cage
