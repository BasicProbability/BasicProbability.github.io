Subject Looking for Strategic Boardgame for Baseball

Last year my nine year old son fell in love with baseball and now
likes to play and to follow the professionals  I would like to buy
him a board game so he can catch a glimpse of and practise a little of
the managerial stragegy  I am not looking for a computer game or any
type of game where manual dexterity determines the winner  I am after
something that he and his friends can spread out over a table on a
rainy day and spend some thoughtful time over

I would appreciate the names of any recommended games  I dont follow
this newsgroup so email responses would be ideal
