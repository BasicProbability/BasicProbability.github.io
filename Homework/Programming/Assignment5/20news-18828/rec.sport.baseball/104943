HighlightLow Lights of the Series

Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins but of
the American League as well  Going into todays game Deshaies was 30
with a 174 ERA  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 23 innings meaning
his ERA will climb slightly  Deshaies who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius

Willie Banks has put together two solid starts for the Twins going 61 innings
on Monday while coasting on solid Twins hitting  Deshaies and Banks now 
combine for 6 of the Twins eight victories while TapaniMahomesErickson are
05

Wednesdays game marked the first opposing lefthanded starting pitcher for the
Twins this year Rickey Bones  The Twins teed off against both him and 
subsequent relief including a Grand Slam by Kent Hrbek which pushed the lead
to 73  The Twins pitching staff could not hold the lead though allowing
4 walks in the 7th inning 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded
Tapani gave up one walk before being relieved Guthrie two walks and Mike
Hartley one walk before the inning was over  This tied the game at 77 and
the Brew Crew rocked Mike Hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win
it

Aguilera continues to be shaky against the Brew Crew  6 of 20 career blown
saves have come against the Brew Crew and todays game was shaky as well
Coming into the ninth with a 52 lead Aguilera gave up a solo HR to Vaughn
then hits to Darryl Hamilton and Dickie Thon before finally retiring the
side  Once again the tying run made it to second base on Aggie
Weak hearted Twins fans are advised not to watch Aggie in the ninth

General News

Pedro Munoz continues to improve as an outfielder playing in left field on
Tuesdays game  He continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching
though which has limited his playing time  Gene Larkin and JT Bruettformer
Gopher have been playing right field as both can bat left handed

The Twins begin a three game series with the Detroit Tigers tomorrow  Starting
Pitching is tentatively scheduled as Erickson Mahomes Banks  The Detroit
Tigers have had TWO 20 run games in the last ten days and should provide 
quite a challenge to the young MN pitching staff

The Twins have 9 HRs this year three each from Puckett Hrbek and Winfield
the third fourth and fifth batters respectively

Brian Harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second
this year and shows much improvement in this category

Jim Deshaies has three pickoffs and one balk this year  Some say he 
has the best 1st base move in baseball  This move has enabled him to pitch
out of some tight early jams and has certainly contributed to his 40 
start  Watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
rubber on the pickoff move
