 2   Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get
       more good pitches to hit  This is important since he struggles
       so much with breaking balls  Opposing pitchers dont want to
       walk Williams to get to Bonds

I have to wonder if this good hitter behind you argument is really valid
Has anyone done a study on this

	You want a study Look at Matt Williams the year after
	Mitchell was gone Look no further Not a scientific
	study but itll show the truth for Matt Besides Bonds
	wants to bat 5th
