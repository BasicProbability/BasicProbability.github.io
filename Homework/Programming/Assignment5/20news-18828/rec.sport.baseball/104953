    For the last couple of years the Braves have been fostering a program to reach to the Latin American audience  This has included licensing Spanish fan magazines encouraging Spanish cobroadcasts and marketing programs directed at the Latin American community  One of the biggest heros to the Latin American audience has been Francisco Cabrerra a fact of which he was slightly embarrassed  

One funny story is that during Spring Training the Braves played a game in Mexico  This game was broadcast back to Atlanta in Spanish  It took the broadcasters a few innings to get a rythm going because they had to keep changing their location  Seems it took a while to find a place where they could get a clear signal on their cellular phones through which they were calling the game
