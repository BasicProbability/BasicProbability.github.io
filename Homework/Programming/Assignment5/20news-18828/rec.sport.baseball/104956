In a game that saw a little of everythingincredible defense some power
clutch pitching and a little wildnessthe Reds managed to overcome their
trademark lack of timely hitting in crucial situations

 During spring training I made a similarly innoncentlooking comment 
 about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying  no such
 thing as clutch hitting they the SDCNs all screamed  I assumed
 they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance
 given their comments  

This is certainly not the case  There is no significant ability toi
perform in the clutch but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a gamewinning hit  The clutch pitching quoted above is
something which happened not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher

 Over the past four seasons Sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as
 clutch situations by The Scouting Report for an average of 228
 Over that same period he had another 1539 abs with 452 hits for an
 average of 294

 According to the rest of the SDCNs any differential such as this is
 completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable
 inference such as perhaps Perez should have used a pinch hitter in
 that situation

Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2 chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split the average decrease is 7 points
standard deviation about 30  There will be such hitters in any league
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays

And there is only a very weak correlation 01 in my best study between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability  Based only on this data I dont see any reason to
pinchhit for Sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinchhit
Does the pinchhitter give you a platoon advantage  Any portion of
Sabos clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves
