 	Ideally DHs should be the strongest offensive players because
 any schmoe can play DH if he can hit  That would take care of position
 corrected anomolies such as Franks  Since that is not the case and why
 not  Is it always this way then we are going to have trouble finding the
 true value of DHs using the same models as that for position players

There are several reasons for this difference  The main reason is that
good hitters in their prime such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull
are rarely regular DHs even if they cant field its more commonly a
place to put aging veterans

Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury
slowly getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the
field  I would expect such players to hit worse as DHs than they did
during the rest of the season

A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first
or the outfield dont hit as well as DHs for some reason  Reggie
Jackson was a good example in five years as a RFDH for the Angels he
hit like the old Reggie when he was in right

The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by
their primary position only a player who plays 90 games in right and 60
at DH will count only in the right fielders averages

 	A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement
 value if you can find it for 1B or LF or something  We can assume that
 if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value even though I
 doubt this is actually true for players like Winfield and Molitor  This
 would let us discount the time they spend playing DH because that
 forces the team to find another real fielder to play

This makes sense you might also look at it another way  Although the
average offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left
fielder the replacementlevel offensive performance is certainly
lower if you are a left fielder but cant hit well enough to keep a job
anywhere then you certainly cant hit well enough to keep a job at DH
