Sigh  Here we go again                     

Actually several SCDNs stated that there were no definable skills
that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch
situations vs nonclutch situations however one might choose to
define clutch

Right  Can YOU define such a skill

Must I  If I were to say that batting average is a predictor that 
can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a
hit on a particular plate appearance is that only valid if I can
define the skill in hitting a baseball  Thats all Ive said 
except I used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations

And elsewhere on this thread Sherri Nichols repeats her position
that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic

For predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  At least
if it has meaning we dont know how to find it

I did not say I could predict the future  Ive suggested that the
statistic is not necessarily meaningless  Heres the data for this
situation

		NonClutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA

Sabo		1539	452	294		259	59	228
Samuel		1564	383	245		278	83	299	


If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting Samuel  Im sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance  You just wouldnt have used this particular
aspect of prior performance  Is this not correct


Ill try to avoid being insulting  But its difficult when you so
cavalierly dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an I dont pretend
to understand but

NOBODY IS DENYING that there are people who have hit well in the
clutch in the past  But I challenge you to find a method to predict
who will hit well in the clutch in the future  Which after all is
what you are claiming you can do  Since


One more time  I did not claim to be able to predict the future
I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo

And I am not dismissing your work  Im stating my opinion
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work


Fine  We have plenty of data  Obviously our preconceived biases must
be coloring our work since you know clutch hitting is a
welldefined and consistent skill all of our failures
notwithstanding  So I challenge you to PROVE IT  I guarantee you
that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability
you will have plenty of happy SDCNs dancing around you

I did not say that clutchhitting is well defined

	I said that the data is significant  to me

I did not say that it is a consistent skill

	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances
	

But you arent going to win any support by merely stating a position
and claiming they are stupid so I must be right


And big sigh


I have NOT
	NOT
	 NOT
	  NOT
	   NOT
	    NOT
	     NOT EVER called you or anyone else on rsb stupid


It is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility
that you actually could have some preconceived biases


Yeah  Hindsight is always 2020  Doesnt that make you bright  This
is a stupid argument and you know it

Ah  I knew we could get to the name calling  And theres that word
you like so much


A suggestion  Take data from 19901991 and attempt to come up with
some method that predicts who hit well in the clutch in 1992  If that
works we can then attempt to apply it to 1993 and beyond

Wait a minute  I thought I first had to define clutch hitting
Do I or dont I

You have made strong statements  Now back them up or be proven a
total idiot

I made two statements in my post

1	I am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting

2	I would have hit for Sabo


As for 2 many of us make a number of written statements through 
this media about what we think will happen in baseball  Im not
shy about it  Ill make the statement again  I believe that by
seasons end that Chris Sabos batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I cant prove that it will happen so I guess well 
just have to wait and see


                                  
Heres another one for you  In 1989  1991 Joe Carters batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in nonclutch situations each year  I presume you think
this is random  

NonClutch	1585 AB		411 H		259
Clutch		 338 AB		 68 H		201

So what could we expect in 1992 from Mr Carter

Well his composite BA through 1989 was 268  through 1990 was
262  through 1991 was 263 so I think we have a pretty good
idea of what kind of batting average he can produce  In 1992
he hit 264  Not surprising huh  Also in 1992 

NonClutch	 536 AB		144 H		269
Clutch		  86 AB		 20 H		233

No this doesnt prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers  It just makes me think that in 1993
Joe Carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in nonclutch situations
                                 
 
As for 1 above I have plenty of company  John Dewan of STATSINC is
the editor of The Scouting Report wherein the statistics regarding
clutch hitting are compiled reported and referenced in the text
Bill James makes numerous references to a players ability to hit
well in the clutch  I am not saying that I can predict the future
any more than they are   You and others are saying that your
work renders their statements and mine meaningless  I dont 
accept that which in your words proves that I am a total idiot


Stupid  Total idiot  

My my  Such hostility
