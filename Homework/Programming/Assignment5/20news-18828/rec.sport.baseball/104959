Subject Mea Culpa  Bosio nono

Like Clinton and Reno I accept full responsibility for this
senseless disaster  My wife and I picked this game to go to
and thus caused the return of the preseasonprojected Sox
offense  Like all nonos Bosio was good lucky hard grounder
by Vaughn off T Martinez glove but straight to Boone who 
threw to Bosio at first 341 and backed by good defense
many nontrivial groundouts  The game was amazingly fast
as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also 
working fast  The Sox relief pitching was ok  the runs off
Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single
which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch

Greenwells mental stability is a serious concern I guess it
has always been but his quirks were amusing back when he was
an MVP candidate  Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a
after striking out on a bad inside pitch apparently Johnson
made an ok Ive got to stay focused gesture which Iron Mike
interpreted as taunting and struck out to heavy booing the 
next two times  As Valentine noted last night he came up in
the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game
Can you say take the first pitch  Not Mike who dribbled it
into a 643  The PI quoted Bosio that this was a batting
practice fastball  Next time up he also hit the first pitch
a hard liner straight to KGJr in center  He also made the
pathetic error and failed to catch Boones HR which looked 
comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight
reel that night

Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively  I couldnt tell from
the field angle but his range looked bad and he coughed a DP
that cost a run or two  Why was he leadoff  I hope Fletcher
gets well soon

Also on lineups Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond
me  It seemed to work as he was 34 with a HR and some good
defense a wag behind us said He sure dont want to go back to
Calgary  There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth
because theyll likely lead off the second as Boone did

Well now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in
Langston  A reminder that contest entries are open through next
Wednesday  I expect a surge of pessimism  By the way ties will
be broken by earliest entry  One entry per person or pseudonym
please and easy on the pseudonyms
