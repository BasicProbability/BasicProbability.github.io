Can anyone out there tell me why they call lefthanded pitchers

I dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums the batter faces northeast and so when
a pitcher is on the mound his left arm is to the south hence the term

Southpaw

Also the story on how the term originated

Thanks 


Go Cubs 

Prediction They will finish over 500 this year without winning the East
