Ive been a Braves fan for as long as Ive been watching baseball almost 12
years now  I say that just tp preface what Im about to post

This Braves team is made up of slow starters  People are amazed that the
Braves arent hitting  Dont be  They werent hitting last year at this
time nor were they the year before  They had slow Aprils and Mays in the
1991 and 1992 seasons  and yet they still managed to go to the Series in
those years  Well this team is no different so why should we be suprised
at their slow start  They started that way for the past two years and
theyll be that way until the Richmond club makes it to the majors  Judge
their offense in June or July when things start to average out  Im just
happy that the Reds have gotten off to such a poor start  The Giants always
do well in the early part of the season but theyll be out of the race by
July just like the last few years  Unless Bonds developes a knuckelball
their staff will get rocked by midJune  

Wow You really know how to hurt a guy Guess I shouldnt bother watching
any more games Its already been decided
