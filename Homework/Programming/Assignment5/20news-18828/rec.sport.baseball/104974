 I dont pretend to understand
statistical analysis

Well we agree on the last part 

Cool  And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly
namecalling of others  


 One of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a players performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year  A 
players batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year

OK

the basic problems with something like clutch batting average  overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero 
Adding to the sample size doesnt seem to help much

Actually I think the largescale sample size is part of the problem
It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to BA vs Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve  The Xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting
vs nonclutch  the Yaxis being the number of players  Certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  My
supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently
year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players
as opposed to all baseball players

  As a counterexample to 
what you showed consider the following two players from 19841987

               NonClutch                      Clutch
               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA
 
Maldonado      1060    260     245            254     78      307
Lemon          1643    457     278            256     57      223

If you had had these two players in 1988 by your logic in those clutch
situations youd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye  Well in 
1988 Maldonado hit 267 in nonclutch and 190 in clutch while Lemon
hit 254 in nonclutch and 313 in clutch  Before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data

You wont hear those kind of accusations from me  It is interesting
that you selected Maldonado because he is someone whom I have also 
looked at  He has been a very inconsistent hitter in terms of BA
hitting in 1989  92  217 273 250 272    Admittedly he has
been traded between leagues as well as clubs  His clutch hitting 
record is equally inconsistent  So for my purposes in 1993 I would
not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based
on his prior performance  I dont know how I would have felt in 1988
but you may indeed be right  

When I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting and
a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately
below his nonclutch BA  Ditto for Joe Carter

This probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having
with others on this topic  Must any conclusion based on statistical
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before
it has any validity  Is it impossible or irrational to apply
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base


BTW correlating players overall batting average from 8487 with
88 gives a correlation coefficient of 059 which is significant at
something better than the 999 confidence level  Correlating their
clutchnonclutch BA for the same period gives a correlation of 
0088 significant at no level of any interest

I completely accept that reasoning  Again what if we were to find
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent
basis 

Actually its technically incorrect to say that we cant predict future
clutch performance  Its more correct to say that we cant predict
future clutch performance with any skill

amen
