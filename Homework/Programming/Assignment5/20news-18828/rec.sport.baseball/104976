Sigh  Here we go again                     

You started it

For predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  At least
if it has meaning we dont know how to find it

I did not say I could predict the future

You most certainly did

		NonClutch			Clutch	 
		AB	H	BA		AB	H	BA
Sabo		1539	452	294		259	59	228
Samuel		1564	383	245		278	83	299	

Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel  Yet you would pinchhit
Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and
Sabo will be a choke hitter  Right  Id call that predicting the
future

If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting Samuel  Im sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance  You just wouldnt have used this particular
aspect of prior performance  Is this not correct

Right  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past  Overall performance LR splits
even matching hittingpitching styles  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly

EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance  And in this case everything else
pointed to Sabo

One more time  I did not claim to be able to predict the future
I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo

That comes down to the same thing  When Perez left Sabo in he
was predicting the future the next AB  He was predicting that
Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel

By supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite

And I am not dismissing your work  Im stating my opinion
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work

Well yes  You are aware of its existance  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite  You dont seem to think the
work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important
Id say this is insulting

I did not say that it is a consistent skill

	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances

RIGHT  This is the beef  It has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under any circumstances  At least none that
weve been able to come up with  If you know of some where it is an
indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret

It is nice however to see that you will consider the possibility
that you actually could have some preconceived biases

Most certainly  As I have repeatedly stated if you can come up with
a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability I would
love it  However the straightforward attempts at such a study have
all failed miserably

Yeah  Hindsight is always 2020  Doesnt that make you bright  This
is a stupid argument and you know it

Ah  I knew we could get to the name calling  And theres that word
you like so much

Well it was a stupid argument  Are you honestly debating that
Sure we know Sabo didnt get a hit  We have no idea whether Samuel
would have done any better or not  One AB most certainly doesnt
prove anything

I believe that by
seasons end that Chris Sabos batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I cant prove that it will happen so I guess well 
just have to wait and see

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year  Or is this
a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit
xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall

If you mean the first then as you say well just have to wait and
see  But the second is a much stronger statement  In fact it
suggests a rule  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years  I think you will agree that if the rule
didnt work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do
any better this year  Right

Heres another one for you  In 1989  1991 Joe Carters batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in nonclutch situations each year  I presume you think
this is random  

Im not going to get into case analysis  Sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from 8991 and then hit poorly in 92 as well  You
can also find those who hit poorly from 8991 and then hit well in
92

No this doesnt prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers  It just makes me think that in 1993
Joe Carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in nonclutch situations

Gamblers fallacy  Unless there is reason to expect consistency a
run proves nothing  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next  Ive seen a detailed study of
why I shouldnt expect it to correlate

Stupid  Total idiot  

My my  Such hostility

The stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  And
I dont see how you can deny it  As for total idiot  Yes  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits nicely

So tell me  Does the term fit  Or do you have an open mind

Valentine
