 	Griffey well most of it are intentional walks  
 
 Are you sure about this

id say pitching around him is more likely


	Yeah maybe that is more likely  But from the MarinersTigers 
series it seems like every time there are base runners the pitchers 
seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass  The 
funny thing was that Griffey was struggling up until the last game of the
four game series if I remember correctly
