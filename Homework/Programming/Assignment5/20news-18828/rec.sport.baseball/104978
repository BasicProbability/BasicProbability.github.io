Mattingly scores badly on both counts He doesnt get to very many
balls and he lets a lot of balls go through The fact that he looks
smooth has great hands and makes few errors means NOTHING This is
traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be
misled Like a lot of bad fielders Mattingly actually makes himself
look better by not having any range Hes nowhere near as bad as Steve
Garvey but thats not much of a compliment 

I agree with the flavor of this post but disagree with one specific
argument  That has great hands means nothing  It seems to me that
a firstbasemans defensive value is not entirely or even primarily
from his ability to field grounders or catch popups  How many such
chances does he get during a game  Many fewer than he gets chances
to catch throws from 2BSS3B and P I mean the total of these is
much higher than GrounderPopup totals  This implies to me that there
is value in catching these throws well even if they are high uptheline
or in the dirt  Good Hands are needed for such plays and thus have
value  I dont have any numbers for the relative number of occurences
of these plays but Id guess that the values of these abilities are
similar  Its just like you dont judge catchers defense primarily
on how they field bunts and popups But not as marked I suppose
