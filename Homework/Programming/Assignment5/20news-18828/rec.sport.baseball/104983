I am curious to known if there are any professional sports teams whose
games are regularly broadcast on an FM station  The only one I am
aware of is WYSP in Philadelphia who carries the Eagles games

If you respond to me I will summarize for the list


WIP is the REAL home of the Eagles  Merril Reese and the Birds on
FM radiowhat a joke

At least we can hear the joke more than 100 yards outside city limits now
Will WIP ever strngthen their signal
