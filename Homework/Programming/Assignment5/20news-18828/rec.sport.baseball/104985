Subject The Braves will come around

To all the Braves doubters

Dont worry  The bats will come alive and the Braves will come around
The pitching is solid and as long the Braves dont have serious injuries
to the starting rotation theyll continue to pitch well  Heck with
the five starters on the Braves rotation they could even sustain an
injury to one of the five I hope this doesnt happen though

The bats are there Pendleton will certainly bat over 280 Justice
is catching fire Bream Nixon Sanders Gant well theres too
much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer  Right now the
Cleveland Indians have 7 players batting over 300  But I certainly
wouldnt their seven for our respective seven though wouldnt the
Braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting
over 300

The bullpen well it IS suspect  But when the bats come alive the
guys in the bullpen will be of less concern

So anyway I believe the Braves will be tough to beat this season  Im
not saying the Braves have automatically won the division but Im optim
istic about their season though its awful painful to watch them at
times right now

Go Braves

Dean
