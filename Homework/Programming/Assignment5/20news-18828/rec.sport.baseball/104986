I just dont
happen to think that the 1115 minutes added to the length of games over
the last 10 years has added anything interesting

How would you quantify that  I suppose an easy way would be to look at
attendance figures  Anyone got the numbers

Attendance figures arent going to quantify anything about my personal
opinion which the above is clearly stated as  Add to me to the end of
my sentence if youre confused about what I meant

Oh no I wasnt confused  I understood that it was your personal
opinion  But I thought we were discussing the need to shorten
games  The arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on
the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage
them from going to the ballpark  Id like to see if the increased
length of games has negatively affected attendance  If it has then
there is a problem and something should be done about it  If it
hasnt then there isnt a problem and theres no need to monkey
with things as they are
