The Giants have won 8 of their last 10 games behind some solid pitching
excluding that 1312 win against Atlanta  If they can stay around first
place after say the first 50 games I think theyve got a legitimate chance
at winning the pennant and maybe even more than that

Dont you remember that the Giants were in 1st place as late as
June last year   Then their pitching collapsed   Their problem
is they have optimistically only 23 good starting pitchers
SwiftBrantlyand the bowlercant remember his name  the
other starters are extremely unreliable and often get blasted
before 4 innings that means the already shallow bullpen gets
over worked  This means after a few months the bullpen collapses
and their postallstar record tends to be much worst than
their preallstar record  

    THe bowler is John Burkett who went to 40 last night  He is
a bargain pickup on my roto team I got him at a minimum of 5

   Just a thought does someone have the wonlost prepost
allstar records for the Giants the last few seasons   I bet
their records tends to be worst and worst as the season goes on

     This is not really true  Excluding last season the Giants
has been a better 2nd half team  In 1991 they had a hot August
to pull to within a few games of the Braves and Dodgers before
fading in September
     The Giants may go back to earth but not as fast as last
season for two reasons
1   Barry Bonds
2   Roger Craig is no longer the manager  Dusty can manage
      his pitching staffs much better than Craig
