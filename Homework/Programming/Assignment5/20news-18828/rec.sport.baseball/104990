TWINS UPDATE   Posted April 22 1993  

Jim Deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the Twins but of
the American League as well  Going into todays game Deshaies was 30
with a 174 ERA  Deshaies allowed 2 Earned runs in 6 23 innings meaning
his ERA will climb slightly  Deshaies who came to MN via a trade with
Philadelphia which sent David West there continues to make Andy MacPhail
look like a true genius

Minor correction Hartley came in the West trade to Phily  Deshaies signed
as a free agent 17M over 2 years  He pitched for San Diego last year
