I watched the final inning of Bosios nohitter with several people at
work After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he
wouldnt have had time to throw Riles out Yet the throw beat Riles
by about two steps I wonder how many others who watched the final out
think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand

In this mornings paper or was it on the radio Vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
easily thrown out Riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
final play more memorable  Seems a litle cocky to me but he made it
work so hes entitled
