Based only on this data I dont see any reason to
pinchhit for Sabo or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past

But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinchhit
Does the pinchhitter give you a platoon advantage  Any portion of
Sabos clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting  Do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run  Do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves


Hey  Whats this  We agree

No platoon advantage Sabo vs Samuel

Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters
	and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with
	slow curves and change ups

Sabo has more power and a little bit of a better batting eye  Samuel
	is noted as an agressive freeswinger  Sabo has more homerun power

Both players started the game hitting below 200  

There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted
	Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later  But the game
	was on the line and Samuel never did get in

Given all of this I dont see a lot to suggest pinchhitting nor do
I see anything to suggest no pinchhitting  There is of course the
clutchhitting information  But if thats useless

Then again  If its not
