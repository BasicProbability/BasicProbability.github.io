if this is true note that i dont think it is lasorda should be
fired for at least two reasons

         1 publicly humiliating his players
         2 knuckling under to his players wishes

I DID NOT WRITE THAT  In fact those statements were a rebuttal to
an earlier posting that I made and this was culled from my strong
rebuttal to those statements  PLEASE  Slander  Shame


There is a fine line between getting players input and knuckling
under to players demands  A manager much like a military officer
needs to have his her players complete obedience and respect during
a game  After the game its no big deal but when there is no time 
to do more than react players must trust the manager or the team often
falls apart see Boston Red Sox ff    


after the game its no big deal    After the employees leave
the workplace it doesnt matter what they say about the boss or the
company  Puhlease


Strawberrys demeanor as represented by the media often sounds like
demands  I suspect that a comment like I enjoy hitting fourth Im
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if
it came from Strawberry  Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying
I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best
in that role  Paraphrased by my memory and bias  That seems like
a fairly nonpetulant answer to what was almost certainly a question 
like How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order


First its Ross Porter  Second I am really tired of seeing the kind
of response that indicates that all I do is parrot what some media
person says or writes  I have a brain  If I choose to characterize
something in a certain fashion its because that is what I believe
to be accurate  It is not just because some unnamed mediot made
the characterization  

A more mediasensitive player might answer The manager knows what he is
doing  If he thinks that batting me third will help the team then I
am all for it  Wed ignore that answer as brown stuff so it seems a
little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryls response as petulant

I did not brand Darryls response as petulant because I never heard
any response from Darryl  I did call him a name  I referred to him 
as a primadonna  Someone else concluded that I did that because I
hate him  I dont hate him  I think hes a primadonna  If you
disagree fine  But stop putting words in my mouth
