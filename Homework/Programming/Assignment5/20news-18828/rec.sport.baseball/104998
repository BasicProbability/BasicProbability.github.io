Actually I think the largescale sample size is part of the problem
It seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to BA vs Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve  The Xaxis being the  deviation in clutch hitting
vs nonclutch  the Yaxis being the number of players  Certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell  My
supposition is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently
year after year at one end of the bell or the other then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players
as opposed to all baseball players

Lets be careful here  If players performance was completely random
in ClutchNo Clutch then you would still expect some players to be
good in the clutch every year and some to be notsogood every year
With two years worth of data youd have 14 of the players good each
year 14 bad each year and 12 would have one good and one bad year
We have 96 players for 5 years 8488  Just flipping a coin youd
expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year
This is what we actually get

No of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5
Clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3
Coin flip random   3   15   30   30   15    3

Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
leading to deviations from nonclutch performance was completely random
If there was anything to clutch hitting at least in this definition
that had any predictive capability you expect to see the number of
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
a coin  Further if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
or below average in clutch situations say 1 standard deviation from 
the mean more than one year the random explanation still looks good
In the four years 8487 that I looked at the data from Elias there
were 79 29 players with a minimum of 25 50 at bats in clutch 
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years  Of
those 79 29 players 38 14 of them changed sign between the two
years  In other words they were great clutch hitters one year and
really horrible the other year  If it was just a random process 
youd expect those numbers to be 395 145  

Everything thats been measured about clutch hitting over a period
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
proposed definition has looked like a random process with the 
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
that could be dragged out of the dataeg John Lowenstein 
probably never had a clutch AB against a lefthanded pitcher
but he might well have had some in blowouts so that there would
be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his 
platoon advantage  This is not a subject that has been glanced
at casually  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
studying it and every one of them with the exception of the
Elias study has been unable to find anything that would allow
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
than flipping a coin  Selfserving plug follows  some of the
flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth
coming SABR book The Perfect Game by Taylor Publishing  The
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance so go bug
your local bookstores now and maybe I can get enough to take my
wife to dinner once
