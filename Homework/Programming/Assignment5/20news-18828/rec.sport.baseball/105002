To beat a dead horse I seem to remember a fair amount of sympathy for 
some black fringe player named Roberto Clemente  And for Roy 
Campanella  And for Thurman Munson  And for just about anyone else 
who we may not even have liked as players but mourned for dying too young

Wiggins Alan

I believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died

But thats besides the point  Im sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed  But they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions

Example  

How about Jose Canseco  He gets a couple of speeding tickets and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time

Uh he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car and smashing it
into a tree as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car And the 
speeding reported was over 100 mph reckless driving

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year  Two years ago  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity etc  

Actually I hadnt heard about this thanks

Meanwhile Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton and I didnt
read any sportswriter complaining about that  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstras character or Daultons intelligence for that
matter based on this incident

I dont know what you were reading or watching but I sure saw a LOT about 
that and about Dykstras poker games Most of the writing was along the lines
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was and how hed hurt the team by
wracking himself and the catcher up etc ESPN raised questions about his
judgement etc The print media here in the SF area questioned why disciplinary
action wouldnt be taken against Dykstra and one article pointed out that if
Lenny wanted to kill himself there were ways that wouldnt endanger other
peoples lives Then there was Dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
was etc
