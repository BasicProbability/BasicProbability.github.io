When I say black I mean USborn black people for the purposes of this
discussion  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947 and one 
team in the 50s signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did  

What about black hispanics

And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

Dont know  But remember this is the country that had special racial
			    
laws for one group and one group only blacks  Our national history 
 

Man you had better do some SERIOUS reading I really really doubt that you
meant to say this
