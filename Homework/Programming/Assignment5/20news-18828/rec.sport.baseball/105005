Just wondering  A friend and I were talking the other day and
we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We werent able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help

Hank Greenberg would have to be the most famous because his Jewish
faith actually affected his play missing late season or was it world
series games because of Yom Kippur

The other Jewish HOFer is Rod Carew who converted  

Did he ever really convert  He married a Jewish woman but Ive never
heard him say he converted  Elliot Maddox on the other hand

Lowenstein is Jewish as well as Montanas only representative to the
major leagues

Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish  Between Stone
Koufax Ken Holtzman  might have the wrong pitcher Im thinking of the
one who threw a nohitter in both the AL and NL and Big Ed Reulbach
thats quite a starting rotation  Moe Berg can catch  Harry Steinfeldt
the 3b in the TinkersEversChance infield

Yep Holtzman  Saul Rogovin won an ERA title in 1949 or so before blowing out
the arm

Is Stanky Jewish  Or is that just a Dave Cohen kinda misinterpretation
Whatever doesnt look like he stuck around the majors too long

Id be surprised  btw they may just be shopping Gallego around to
make room for AS
