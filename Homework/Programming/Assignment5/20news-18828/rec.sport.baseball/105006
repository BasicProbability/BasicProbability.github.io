   Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
 on the team To a large extent If Frank Thomas hit first hed lose a LOT
 of RBIs and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive
 in 100 runs Doesnt happen that oftenvery unlikely with Devon Whites
 300 OBP in front of you
Im pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once  I know someone
will correct me if Im wrong  

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics  You
can talk about OBP and SLG all you want but the fact remains

	The team that scores more runs wins the game
	

Right  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited as long as the TEAM
gets more runs  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI but 
doesnt score them all himself who cares

Consider

Player A single
Player B grounder to short reaches on the force at 2nd
Player C Double B to 3rd
Player D Sac fly

B gets a run D gets an RBI  Are you sure they helped the team
more than A and C  Think hard now

Flame Away

As you wish

Roger
