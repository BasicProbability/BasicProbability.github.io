Daniel Patrick Staub is a Catholic school kid from Nawlins Mordecai
Brown a farm kid probably Protestant from somewhere in the Midwest
He lost those fingers in a farm machinery accident

Jim Palmer isnt Jewish himself but Mr Jockey Shortss adoptive 
parents are

Also Im not absolutely certain that Carew actually converted  His
wife and children certainly are Jewish
