        Spanky is too slow  If he were quicker he would still be here
 But with Slaught and Tom Prince they didnt want to lose Prince in order
 to bring up that 11th pitcher  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
 Prince is coming along nicely
 
 Tom Prince is a 28 year old nohit catcher  Think of him as a young Dann
 Bilardello  

Or a young Don Bordello

 I cant begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of
 losing this guy whos been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons  The Pirates
 released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options then
 eventually sent Prince down anyway and he cleared waivers without a peep
 Hes another year older and still cant hit why do they think he wouldnt
 clear waivers now  Why would they care

Theres a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching  
prospects in the minors at this point  at least nobody ready for any serious  
AAAmajors duty  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  
just age especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid30s or something
 
All things considered though Id be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  
the plate than Prince  Isnt there decent backup backstop out there looking  
for work
