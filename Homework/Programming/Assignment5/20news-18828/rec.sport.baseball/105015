Subject Info on JT Snow

Im sure all of you have heard of the extraordiary start by  rookie
JT Snow of the California Angeles  Other than the fact that his
father was a star receiver with the LA Rams and is now a radio
personality in Los Angeles and JT came from the Yankees organization
I dont know much about JT  If anyone has info and background on 
the young fenomplease post

By the way for those of you not following his exploits he has hit
four home runs in three days  Two last night  He has also delivered
the winning hit a couple of times for the Angeles in this young season

Thanks

Michael from USC
