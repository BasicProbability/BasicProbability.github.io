To really speed up the game umps need to START CALLING STRIKES the way
they used to  Im talking about making the strike zone start at the
knees and go up to the top of the letters  Forget this the strike zone
is in the general area of the groin  A lot less 3and2 counts and a
quicker game 

They tried that in the 60s and people stopped coming to the ballparks 
in droves as offense suffered immensely

They lowered the mound first before the 69 season  The shrinkage of
the strike zone didnt start until the mid70s
