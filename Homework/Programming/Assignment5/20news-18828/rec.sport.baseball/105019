  Uhhhhh Winfield has a carrer slugging average of 480
  CAREER
 
 PEAKNO
 During Winfields peak his slugging average was an average of 129 points  
above
 the league average Mel Otts is 278 Hank Aarons is 266 and Frank  
Robinsons
 is 304 In their worst years of their peak they are still better than
 Winfield in his best peak year Winfields best is 158 above the  
average
 Otts worst is 164 above the average and Robinsons worst is 206 above  
the
 league average
 
 CAREERNO
 480 sluggingBIG DEAL
 Many right fielders including Darryl Strawberry and Andre Dawson can  
easliy
 surpass this for a career slugging average So unless there are some  
REAL stats
 that make winfield worthy of the team he wont even be allowed to be  
water boy
 
 PS Eddie Gaedel is the water boy and his career on base percentage is  
tons
 better than winfields





Check your factsAndre dawsons career Slugging pct is in the 480s
So is Winnys I would like to see your facts Winny has probably done  
better than 129 points above with a carrer SLG of 480 Check on more  
important stats DEFENSE and HEART BATTING AVERAGE RBIs

Peak and career especially career Winny ranks in the top 15 outfielders  
of all time You are using BS to make your standings And I would like to  
know where you are getting your numbers from
