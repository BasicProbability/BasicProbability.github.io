   Very interesting Gehrig below bonds and schmidt RICKY HENDERSON  
  He  
   could steal bases but his hitting stats are not even close to  
  dimmagios
   uhhhh Where is Winfield
 
  Hendersons stats are probably closer to DiMaggios than you
  think
 
 Then give me NUMBERS MAN
 
 Winfield could WHIP hendersons butt
 
 At what 
 
 Basestealing Not  Hendersons alltime leader and is good for about
 170 runs worth of SB lifetime  Winfield is about 800 SB behind and 
 has a net 10 runs
 
 Onbase average  Winfields best year 1984 was 397 nine points
 below Hendersons lifetime OBA  Lifetime the diff is 47 points
 
 Slugging  Winfield by 40 points  
 
 Theyre both good OFs though Winfield looks better with his huge
 bod
 
 Winfields best year 1979  308396558  Henderson 1990   
325441577
 TB III gives Henderson a Total Player Rating of 67 Winfield of 40
 They have Rickey as a much better fielder which I dont buy but
 Henderson is simply the best leadoff hitter of all time and Winfield
 isnt the best anything of all time



Henderson is the best leadoff hitter of alltime arguably Winfield has  
meant more to his team than Henderson Unlike daryll henderson tries  
hard He is an amazing centerfielder Rickey is VERY good maybe better  
than winfield I was angry at the dissing of winfield Though Winfield has  
been better than henderson lately Check the numbers winfield may  
surprise you He will have 3000 basehits and should have 500 homeruns  
when he retireswishful thiniking if he plays to 45
