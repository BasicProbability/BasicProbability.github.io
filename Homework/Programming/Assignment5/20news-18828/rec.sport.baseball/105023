 Last night on the GiantsMets radio broadcast Hank and Ted were  
discussing the fact that there were only 16 players who had ever hit 200  
homeruns and stolen 200 bases in their career while HoJo was batting   
Anyone have a list  Not as easy as it sounds to come up with all of them   
I couldnt  Mays Mantle Aaron Henderson Morgan Bonds Dad    
Frank Robinson  Molitor  Yount  Guessing now  Id be interested to see  
the whole list
 
 
  
 
 Thanks
