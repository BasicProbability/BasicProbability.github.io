From wallccswarthmoreedu Matthew Wall
Subject Triva question on Bosios Nohitter

I dont actually have the answer to this one

Bosio after walking the first two batters retired 27straight for a
backend perfect game

How many other games  including extra inning games  have seen a pitcher
retire 27 straight excluding official perfect games

The only other instance of this I know about for sure is the famous Ernie
Shore game which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in
Cooperstown Shore came into the game when Boston Pitcher Babe Ruth got
thrown out for arguing over the firstbatter walk Shore picked him off and
retired 26 straight after that
