 Wow  The tribe gave up 8 more runs last night  Their ERA is 608 and 
 opponents are hitting 304 against them  
 The front office is excited about calling Matt Young up next week to 
 join the rotation  
 
 Well excited doesnt exactly mean happy  In this case it means our
 contract says we have to bring him up by 0501 or release him  and we 
 need to find somebody someplace to do something until some of the injured
 pitchers recover and some of the young pitchers get ready  So we best get
 a move on
 
 Ok so its not the primary definition  So sue me

Im a little worried about this pitching thing  608 is scarry even for
the first 16 games of the season  Mesa sp seems to be settling down 
He pitched well against the Red Soxs but The Rocket matched him  I got a
chance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched well
also  Then the dam broke  Wickander came in and promptly it was 61  3
run homer by Snow

I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBEs top 10 prospects are
pitchers  Anyone out there like to post who these guys are and where they
are
The TRIBE is on ESPN again tonight against Oakland
