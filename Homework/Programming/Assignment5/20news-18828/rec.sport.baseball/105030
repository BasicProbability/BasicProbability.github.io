Some evidence that is NOT working

Take a look at the standings Its REAL easy to get so focussed on 
minutinae and forget that the Giants happen to be in first place If its
working you dont SCREW IT UP by changing things just because you think it
ought to be different

So that is the reason why the Toronto Blue Jays should keep Alfredo
Griffin just because it worked

A team winning doesnt mean that everything that its doing is right
A team not winning doesnt mean that everything that its doing is wrong or
otherwise to borrow the Sharks situation you would say that George Kingston
should be fired

Some folks like to argue about theoretical details I prefer to watch teams
win When the Giants slip to third then we can talk about how to rearrange
the batting order Until then I think its stupid to focus on whats wrong
for the simple fact that ITS WORKING AS IT IS

By then its too late  The problem with not fixing something while its
working is that by then there may not be anything left to fix

Mostly though the Giants are winning and frankly as long as that
continues its rather silly to secondguess their strategy But evidently
some folks would rather be right than be first

So the Blue Jays were simply perfect last year there was nothing that they
could have done to have improved that team  NOT
