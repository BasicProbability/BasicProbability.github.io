Subject Re John Franco

Jason Lee asks
Whats with John Franco  The Mets are hardly using him  I heard he was
completely recovered but now Im not so sure

You must have heard wrong  His arm is still sore  He hasnt gone on the DL
but he may  Managmenet is treating him as a daytoday situation  

His doctors thought that he was ready and they had him throw in
Colorado but his arm wasnt up to the strain  He is throwing every day
but hes just not quite ready to pitch full strength yet

This is based on an interview that he gave on WFAN NY radio on Thursday
