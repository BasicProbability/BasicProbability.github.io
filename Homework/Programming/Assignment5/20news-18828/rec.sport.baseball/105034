quoted for future reference
shown to be consistent in the past  Overall performance LR splits
even matching hittingpitching styles  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly

was predicting the future the next AB  He was predicting that
Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel

He believed one of two things 1 Sabo was more likely than Samuel
to get a hit OR 2 that more good would be done in the long run
by leaving Sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome

In fact you dont know what Perez had in mind when he left Sabo in

By supporting the swap you are predicting the opposite

In fact I dont think anyone is claiming that they can predict
the future or any particular future event  But we can believe
that certain trends are due to a cause whether or not we have
identified the cause and therefore will continue

And I am not dismissing your work  Im stating my opinion
You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work
Well yes  You are aware of its existance  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite  You dont seem to think the
work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important
Id say this is insulting

I think seeing insults in other peoples opinions is kind of silly
After all Mark didnt call you a total idiot or call your work
stupid he simply stated that it didnt change his opinion on the 
subject

I did not say that it is a consistent skill
	I have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
	certain set of circumstances
RIGHT  This is the beef  It has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under any circumstances  At least none that
weve been able to come up with  If you know of some where it is an
indicator of future performance please let us in on your secret

If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has and Mark believes
that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next
season as well would you respond the same way  At some point you
might admit that all variable might not be known to you who knows
what this guy does every Monday night  Maybe he sees his sports
shrink on Tuesday mornings or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights

But this is something thats true of one guy only  It doesnt
mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire
league by days of the week nor that there should be  But it doesnt
mean we cant make predictions based on that for that particular
player

I believe that by
seasons end that Chris Sabos batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I cant prove that it will happen so I guess well 
just have to wait and see

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year  Or is this
a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit
xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall

I only see a prediction for one player here  I dont see anything
about ALL batters

Heres another one for you  In 1989  1991 Joe Carters batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in nonclutch situations each year  I presume you think
this is random  
Im not going to get into case analysis  Sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from 8991 and then hit poorly in 92 as well  You
can also find those who hit poorly from 8991 and then hit well in
92

Thats exactly what Mark is trying to do though  Find hitters
that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions
for these hitters based on their past performance

major league ballplayers  It just makes me think that in 1993
Joe Carters batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in nonclutch situations
Gamblers fallacy  Unless there is reason to expect consistency a

Huh  What does gamblers fallacy have to do with anything
Whether you can know the reason for correlation or not you cant
deny that it has existent you can only make an argument that
you dont think it is likely to continue to exist because you
cant see a reason for it to exist

run proves nothing  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next  Ive seen a detailed study of

Someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate
The argument along the lines of star player with LR splits will
always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game
ie opposing manager will always bring in a AH pitcher to
face him where his manager will not pull him for a PH

I dont see how you can deny it  As for total idiot  Yes  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits nicely
So tell me  Does the term fit  Or do you have an open mind

What about you  If the shoe fits will you wear it with an open mind
