ielding RF of all time as far
 	    as anyone can tell
 
 I did a quick scan last night looking for players with a peak  
comparable
 to or better than Winfield  In my quickndirty subjective judgement  
you
 could make good cases for Ruth Aaron Ott Robinson Clemente Kaline 
 Maris Klein Jackson Waner and probably a few others  This is not a
 knock on Winfield but a comment on his consistency all of those other
 players had awesome stretches and very good stretches while Winfield  
has
 been more uniformly excellent  Hall of Fame  Absolutely  Top10 peak
 Im not so sure  Top 10 total career value  Yes almost certainly
 
 



Point taken When was winfields peak years anyway probably around 85
