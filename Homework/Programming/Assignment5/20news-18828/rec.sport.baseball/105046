While were on the multipurpose subject lets not forget Shea which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets  Jets  It was the first
stadium I think to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball  in parallel for football

Minor point  Shea Stadium was designed as a multipurpose stadium but
not with the Jets in mind as the tennant  The New York Football Giants
had moved to Yankee Stadium from the Polo Grounds in 1958 and was
having problem with stadium management the City did not own Yankee
Stadium until 1972  The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea
When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the
new AFL franchise the New York Titans approached the City about using
the new stadium  The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium where the
Cosmos played soccer in the 70s  Because Shea Stadium was tied into
the Worlds Fair anyway the city thought it would be a novel idea to
promote the new franchise and the Worlds Fair like they were doing
with the Mets  So the deal was worked out

Of course with the Jets gone to Jersey and a truly good football
stadium the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where
because its circular the seats are almost always too far from the
action  The Mets announcersKiner  Murphy in particularhave
always hyped it as beautiful Shea
Stadium a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is

Im under the impression that when Murph says it he means it  As a
regular goer to Shea it is not a bad place since theyve cleaned and
renovated the place  Remember this is its 30th Year
