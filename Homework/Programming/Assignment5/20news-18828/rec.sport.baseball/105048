The Rangers got their only run on a solo home run by Dean Palmer in the 7th
The Tigers opened the scoring with an RBI single by Fryman in the 3rd then
took the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when Whitaker greeted
reliever Burns with an RBI double which scored Tettleton  Whitaker in turn
crossed the plate on an RBI single by Phillips who has been red hot for 
the third Tiger run

This afternoon its another battle of southpaws Bill Krueger for the Tigers
vs Craig Lefferts for the Rangers
