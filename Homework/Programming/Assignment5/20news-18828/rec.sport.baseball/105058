The official MLB formula for OBP is hits plus walks plus hitbypitch
divided by atbats plus walks plus hitbypitch plus sacrifice flies
Sac bunts and errors have no effect Source Total Baseball and they
               

	Sure they might If an error is recorded on for example a
ground ball ie the batter would otherwise be out it is officially a
hitless at bat If its some other type of error Greenwell lets a
single go by it doesnt effect the OBP But most errors are
counted
