maynardramseycslaurentianca Roger Maynard says

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely  that  player As team would have played better with player B
in their lineup  Sheer speculation  Impossible to ascertain


to take this to its er logical conclusion it is impossible to
ascertain whether or not i am a better hitter than roberto alomar
or a better pitcher than juan guzman or a better center fielder than
devon white  after all if i were on the blue jays can you really
prove that they wouldnt have won the world series in both 1991 AND
1992

while i thank you mister maynard for your faith in my atheletic
prowess i can assure you that your faith is misplaced
