Mandelbaum says

Yes  Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are
finally moving in the right direction  They should finish
over 500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race
in August  However I would take back a few moves

1  The Jim Abbott Trade

bleagh this was a terrific trade  snow will certainly be better than
mattingly in the future but that theyll be about the same now is a
defensible opinion  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in
the game today

2  Wade Boggs

im not sure about this one  i think that its good in that a
pre1992 boggs kicks hayesmeulenswhoevers ass and that a 1992
boggs still isnt ALL that shabby  its bad though that the
yankees expect a pre1992 boggs and will probably get a 1992 boggs
however id still play boggs over hayes or bam bam

3  Spike Owen

you have my full agreement here  hes not all that much better than
velarde and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him
however i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname
not that this helps the yankees

4  Danny Tartabull

i strongly disagree  id much much rather have a hundred games of
tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james
