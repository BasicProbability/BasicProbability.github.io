Do you have a better email address Mr Lurie  Im afraid I cant
get the short version to work

In any case on Winfield  Yes his career BA is a mere 285  He
didnt beat this until his sixth year in the majors and has only
topped it once since 1988  His peak was in the early 80s and
included some rather impressive seasons  But then hes also had
other scattered great performances like 1988 and 1992  Definitely
not a smooth career curve

Cheers
