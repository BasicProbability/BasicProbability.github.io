Just had to respond to the Bosox boasts ie Bosox win again 

See Red Sox fans can never do anything right in your mind huh  If we get
excited about the Sox winning you tell us it is going to be over soon  If
we worry that itll be over soon you say that we are not true fans  i am a
Sox fan and I think after what ive been through being a Sox fan that Sox
fans are true fans  I am excited at what they are doing  So Greenwell
was horrible against Johnson who cares the Sox are 114 111 with all
nonDarwin starts what are the Mariners  I think the Sox have the best
record in Baseball still so they lost one darn

Johnson is a quality pitcher

And not the only quality Mariner pitcher  I logged on expecting to see
at least ONE congratulatory note for Chris Bosios NO HITTER but nary
a peep  

So Ill take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 115 and
slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games
or even a hit in last nights gem  

Not that we Ms fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers
of New Englands longrunning tragedy but only one winning season in
history is something of a burden to bear  So well take our joys when
we can get em  

The Mariners now have two nohit pitchers on the staff and not
coincidentally those pitchers beat the Red Sox in back to back games
