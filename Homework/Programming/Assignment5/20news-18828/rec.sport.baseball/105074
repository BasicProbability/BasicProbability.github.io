Dave Kingman is Jewish

Sez who
 
Sez Dave Kingman when he used to take off for Rosh Hashanna and Yom
Kippur on days they coincided with the season

	The only problem is Dave Kingman was always taking off
Rosh Hashana Yom Kippur Easter the day Elvis died 816 the entire
spring training month of Ramadan Purim the 4th of July both games 
that day my birthday OK during the World Series he never had to 
play there Memorial day both games that day 
	Guys help me out here  Ive run fresh out of holidays that 
coincide with the baseball season and Im trying to catalogue all the
days in his career that Dave Kingman or at least his bat went AWOL
	A complete religious calendar detailing every holiday in every
extant religion in the Western Hemisphere would be appreciated  Only
then can we truly be certain that Dave Kingman observed every holiday
ever conceived
	 of course NOT
