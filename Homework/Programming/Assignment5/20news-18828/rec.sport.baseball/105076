Alan All in all its just another Sepinwall writes

Ugliest stance of all time has to go to Oscar Gamble The man would
practically kneel in front of home plate in order to have a small strike
zone Hes just lucky that strike zone size isnt determined by how big
your afro is

	I agree  However I have to object  Growing up in the early
1980s and playing 2 years of Mario Mendozaesque Little League I was
told that since my hitting well sucked I would do best to either
Walk or take one in the face for the team  I did both  And my
Yankee fan father would say Bat like Oscar Gamble  So I did  And my
career OBP was about 550
	Not only was Oscar a fun guy to watch but he had some pretty 
cool baseball cards and helped me become one of the best little league
players in history
