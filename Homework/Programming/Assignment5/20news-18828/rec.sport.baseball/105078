Whats with John Franco  The Mets are hardly using him  

	Dont worry  This is a perfectly normal state of affairs  Had they
actually been using him you should be worried

I heard he was completely recovered but now Im not so sure

	Hes recovered totally from his injury  Thats why hes not
pitchingso he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again
pitching on 38 days rest and then have fun dining in the Diamond Club in
Shea Stadium while AY struggles every day out there

If there is anybody out there with information about Franco I would
appreciate it if you could drop me a line

	Ive be quite happy to drop John Franco just the same
	Bring back Randy Myers
	No better make thatBring Back Neil Allen
