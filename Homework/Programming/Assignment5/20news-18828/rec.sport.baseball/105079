For predicting the future it has been entirely meaningless  At least
if it has meaning we dont know how to find it

I did not say I could predict the future

You most certainly did

I really dont want to get into a DidSoDidNot debate with you  But
this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement  I did not say 
nor did I imply that I could predict the future  You have inferred
that my comments meant this and you have based your rebuttal of my
comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that
there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in
regard to clutch hitting


Sabo		1539	452	294		259	59	228
Samuel		1564	383	245		278	83	299	

Sabo is clearly a better hitter than Samuel  Yet you would pinchhit
Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and
Sabo will be a choke hitter  Right  Id call that predicting the
future

That is your opinion that Sabo is clearly a better hitter than
Samuel  The above data is for a 4year period ending last season
Last season Samuel batted 272 while Sabo hit 244 not park adjusted
This season they are both hitting below 200 albeit Sabo with more
at bats  I will agree that over his career Sabo has been a better
hitter than Samuel but I will also remind you that Samuel has been
a better hitter in certain situations than Sabo

I did not predict that Sabo would choke nor that Samuel would get a
hit  I expressed my opinion that had I been the Reds manager or
even a Reds fan that I would prefer to have Samuel hit in that
situation than Sabo


If you were to have been the Reds manager at that time I assume you
would have had some basis for letting Sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting Samuel  Im sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance  You just wouldnt have used this particular
aspect of prior performance  Is this not correct

Right  I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past  Overall performance LR splits
even matching hittingpitching styles  All of these will give me some
advantage if used properly

Ah  properly  Yes  I see

EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance  And in this case everything else
pointed to Sabo

Please help me  What exactly is everything else that pointed to Sabo


Well yes  You are aware of its existance  You claim to be incapable
of understanding it though I suspect you are simply unwilling  Yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite  You dont seem to think the
work is worth reading yet you obviously feel the topic is important
Id say this is insulting

I must say I was not aware of the publication  Can you email me the
information regarding its availability

And I guess I must apologize to all of those who have done extensive 
study on say supply side economics  I didnt mean to insult you
But I never did believe you were on the right path  Im sorry for
my contrary opinionposition  I also regret that I dont have the
ability to prove that you are wrong  But you are
 

I believe that by
seasons end that Chris Sabos batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in nonclutch
situations  I cant prove that it will happen so I guess well 
just have to wait and see

Is this simply a prediction for Chris Sabo for this year  Or is this
a prediction for all batters who have over the past few years hit
xxx amount  worse in the clutch than overall

It is what it says it is

If you mean the first then as you say well just have to wait and
see  But the second is a much stronger statement  In fact it
suggests a rule  We can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years  I think you will agree that if the rule
didnt work last year or the year before that it is unlikely to do
any better this year  Right


The second is your statement not mine


Im not going to get into case analysis  Sure you can find somebody
who hit poorly from 8991 and then hit poorly in 92 as well  You
can also find those who hit poorly from 8991 and then hit well in
92

Well actually I havent yet  But Im not finished looking
That is I havent yet found someone who hit significantly below
his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 
1989  91 and then reversed that relationship in 1992


Gamblers fallacy  Unless there is reason to expect consistency a
run proves nothing  Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to
correlate from one year to the next  Ive seen a detailed study of
why I shouldnt expect it to correlate

Nope  Sorry  But if you were interested in a reason why I expect
Chris Sabos ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one
year to the next I think I could  If you were interested in a
reason why I expect Joe Carters ability to hit in the clutch to
correlate from one year to the next I think I could  But youre
not interested in that because you think that those conclusions
could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire
baseball population  And they cant be


The stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid  And
I dont see how you can deny it  As for total idiot  Yes  If you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong I would say the term fits nicely

The problem here is that I do believe you  I accept your work
I believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based
on prior clutch history is meaningless  No better than a coin toss
I actually do accept your work

As it happens I also have an opinion that in certain situations
for certain players a history of superior or inferior ability to
hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be
valid in projecting future player performance  For that player
And Chris Sabo is one such player


So tell me  Does the term fit  Or do you have an open mind

Well since I defer to your statistical wisdom I think I must have
an open mind  Now we have to pose the same question to you
