Who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team
Who holds the record for most career strikeouts for the Rangers
Hint Nolan Ryan isnt either

What two pitchers have over 100 career saves for two different teams

Who is the only player to hit 300 or more career home runs and steal 300 or 
more career bases for the same team

No fair peeking at your baseball stats

Ill post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted

For most career Ks with one team if its not Ryan perhaps Steve Carlton
With the Rangers Hough was there for a long time

In the 100 saves departmentMaybe Lee Smithhe should have at least
a hundred with the Cubbies maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards
Then maybe GossageNYY and SD Fingers MIL OAK

Dont know about the homerssteals dept

In some other articleMets trivia it could be Tim Leary in at least
the losing to all teams maybe beating all of em too  Probably Seaver
and Koosman fit too

And in Randy Johnsons nohitter I think it was Scott Bradley the
other half of the old Mariner catching platoon who was behind the plate
that night
