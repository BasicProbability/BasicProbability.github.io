Just wondering  A friend and I were talking the other day and
we were for some reason trying to come up with names of Jewish
baseball players past and present  We werent able to come up
with much except for Sandy Koufax somebody Stankowitz and
maybe John Lowenstein  Can anyone come up with any more  I know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this but
humor us  Thanks for your help


Oh I forgot Art Shamsky former Red and Mets player  Batted 301
between injuries in 1969 fell short of qualifying for Top 10 because of
injuries and platoon with Ron Swoboda no Swobo wasnt Jewish
