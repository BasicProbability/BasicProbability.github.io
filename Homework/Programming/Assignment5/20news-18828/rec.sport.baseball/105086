Subject Re Braves Pitching UpdateDIR


	Amazingly pitchers no matter how good their mechanics are
not machines  Cy Young winners dont pitch in a vaccuum unaware
of how their offenses are doing

	The Braves pitching staff is already showing signs of
cracking under the strain of knowing theyre not going to get many
if any runs  Unfortunately the Braves pitchers were so bad for so
long that the organization put so much stress and I mean stress
on pitching that they completely ignored hitting

	The Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of
the midseventies  Heaven help us
