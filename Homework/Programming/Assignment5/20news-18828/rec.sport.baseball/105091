  What is the maximum runs allowed before a stopper can get credit for a
  relief ie if a stopper comes in with a 5 run lead does he getcredit
   with the save
  If you come in and pitch the last three inningsand your team was ahead 
  when you got out there and wins the game you get a save
  Sorta correct If you pitched at least 3 inningsentered with your team 
  in the lead was the pitcher when the game endedthe game was never tied 
  during your stint and your team won you get a save
 Well the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer you must have
 pitched effectively for your 3 innings  this save is not automatic
 unlike the others

Someone in SABR actually looked at these games a few years ago 
and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one 
of the games  even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly 
allowing 4 or 5 runs

seeing hearing my two sense worth
