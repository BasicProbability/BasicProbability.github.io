Perhaps you can give a more recent citation of any player mentioned as a 
malingerer Thanks

I guess I dont understand your question  I was trying to imply that
the accusations of Glenn Davis malingering were certainly not played
up very much  

Still if the whispers reached San Francisco it is certainly possible they
were stronger elsewhere Also it was teammates making the aspersions In any
event I know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years

But in any case I believe Mike Lavalliere has been accused of poor
work habits and general sloth recently probably not malingering
just as he was being released  Its interesting that nobody heard
much about these problems before if they were so important

I have heard Sanders called many things as well I have NOT heard him called
lazy Given the 2sport phenomenon it would be difficult to label him as
such

Exactly so  Which means his media detractors have had to say other
things about him  I believe its a general phenomenon that if writers
dont like you theyll find a label that will stick no matter who you
are  I find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in
why writers feel they need to act this way  Not that this fascinates
me that much either

Uh the original authors point was that black and white players were por
trayed differently by the media and towards this he gave a highly selected
list to prove his case Sanders name showed up eventually I dispute that
Sanders has ever been called lazy by the media 

Hmm big ego possible club house disturbance etc Is that GOOD press

No but it isnt the total extent of the press he received in
Pittsburgh where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and
spoiled by the local columnists  Again the actual words used may
shift around with time and expediency but lazy tends to be higher
on the list for nonwhite players at least in my subjective opinion

Aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study
on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken
and on teams like the Red Sox which have been traditionally white
Nowadays most people think of Carl Yastrzemski as one of those
bluecollar hardworking guys but in the early 70s he was often
portrayed as a lazy bum  Really

Hmm I never heard anyone accuse Canseco of being lazy Nor Sierra

Ive heard accusations that Canseco was a bad fielder but could be a
great one if he put his mind to it  Ignoring whether or not he is a

Actually Dave Stewart is was one of the most vocal about this In any 
event that is not lazy

At least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the
Cansecoislazy issue so I think your point is at best a quibble and
probably weaker than that

Uh that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first It is NOT a
quibble then to state that the media did not portray Canseco as being 
lazy If the other person chooses to so accuse him after my post that does not
make it a quibble And in fact the media around here tended to play up his
time in the wieght room Hardly lazy and hardly a quibble Have you ever
seen any mediot portray Canseco as lazy Unconcerned with his fielding yes
Lazy no

bad fielder I think this is still interesting  For that matter I
think Cansecos colorful offfield antics get lots more national
attention than those of say Roger Clemens

Well hes had a few more of them

At least more that youve heard about  I think one of the questions
here surrounds selective reporting  Having said that I have to say
that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be
unfalsifiable at least by those of us who arent reporters police
or private investigators

Well Canseco has been involved in several felonies including his highspeed
record carrying concealed firearms and of course the domestic violence 
Clemens had a runin at a bar Canseco had that as well and in both cases the
coverage was relatively minimal

Puckett Stewart Jackson 

I said overrepresent nonwhites  Three anecdotal data points dont
make an interesting counterargument  BTWwhich Jackson are we talking
about here  Reggie Bo Darrin Danny or 

Uh if the only evidence offered is anecdotal how can it be objected that the
counter to it is also anecdotal

And it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title among
others has been accused at some time of caring more for his own
stats than for the good of the team  It also seems to me that youre

Kirby Puckett I have NEVER heard this accusation made of Puckett I 
have heard it of Boggs Actually I believe it of him but thats another 
matter

Not living in Minnesota I cant say whether or not this line has ever
been used against Kirby there  As far as Boggs goes Im not sure why
you bring him up since hes one of the obvious prototypes for the line
I quoted along with Ted Williams Rod Carew and many others

Uh yes and I agree with your assesment of Boggs rather specifically However
you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of
selfishness I have not ever anywhere heard this said of Puckett Pendleton
either Similarly Brett B Williams and others  

How about Daryl Strawberry And I think the plus or minus refers more to 
the born again types ie Butler and Gaetti

Again you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes  On the other
hand my argument by is of the becausejonsaysso variety if we have
no other data  I have to admit I have problems generating lists of
nonwhite players who became infamous for their religious or
political beliefs while names like Butler Gaetti Dravecky Knepper
Hersheiser et al come rolling out

There are others Perhaps they are simply not as outspoken except in the
case of the bornagain types I mention

Mike
