Subject The Babe v The Pride of the Yankees


The Babe and The Pride of the Yankees offer very different renditions of
the sotry about Ruth and Gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the
hospital  Can some historian out there explain historys version of the
story  

I wouldnt put is past either or both of the movies to season the truth
with a little extra spice

Any other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies
