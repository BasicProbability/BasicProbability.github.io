Who holds the record for most career strikeouts while playing for one team
Who holds the record for most career strikeouts for the Rangers
Hint Nolan Ryan isnt either
What two pitchers have over 100 career saves for two different teams

Who is the only player to hit 300 or more career home runs and steal 300 or 
more career bases for the same team

No fair peeking at your baseball stats

Ill post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted

For most career Ks with one team if its not Ryan perhaps Steve Carlton

	No way  gotta be Walter Johnson  All were with Washington
Carlton spent too long in St Louis to collect less than 700 there

With the Rangers Hough was there for a long time

	Id also guess Hough due to his length of tenure though I suspect 
Bobby Witt wasnt far behind  Maybe even Jenkins snuck in close

In the 100 saves departmentMaybe Lee Smithhe should have at least
a hundred with the Cubbies maybe enough with either the RSox or Cards
Then maybe GossageNYY and SD Fingers MIL OAK

	Fingers had to have achieved 100 with either MIL or with SD so yes
Id go with that guess  Otherwise I was thinking that Reardon has a better
chance of having 100 with MIN along with I would think easily reaching 100 
with MON

Dont know about the homerssteals dept

	Gotta be Willie MaysI am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his
career

In some other articleMets trivia it could be Tim Leary in at least
the losing to all teams maybe beating all of em too  Probably Seaver
and Koosman fit too

	HmmmLeary is a really good point  Id forgotten about him  Well
if nothing else there are plenty of exMet pitchers in the category of
could have lost to all teams  Koosman Leary Torrez Ryan Seaver
I guess the best three guesses would be Leary Ryan and either Seaver or
Koosman
