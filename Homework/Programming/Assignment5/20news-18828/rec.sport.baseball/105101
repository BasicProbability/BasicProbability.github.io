about the infield fly rule
So if hes feeling lucky your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up  If it isnt caught hes probably scored
a run  If it is hes probably headed for AAA  

	Unless hes Deion Sanders in which case he just heads back to the
dugout and waits for his next baserunningblunder opportunity
