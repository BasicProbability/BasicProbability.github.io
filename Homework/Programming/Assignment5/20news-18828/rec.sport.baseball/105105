the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not
Roger Clemens sorry Val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to
Incaviglia which was literally at Inkys neck and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it after the swing Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ballhe didnt even turn around to look or
even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard
some 70 or so feet about the Green Monster over 100 feet above the
ground total

truly an amazing shot

I agree  Home runs off Clemens are always memorable  Kinda like
eclipses and hurricanes  They dont happen very often

Cheers
