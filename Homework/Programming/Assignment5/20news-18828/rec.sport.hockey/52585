 The Adams division race is certainly interesting this year  Here are
 important data to keep in mind in the eventuality of a tie for a given
 standing position
 
 In head to head games
 Quebec wins over Montreal 430
 Boston leads against Quebec 311 with two games remaining
 Montreal and Boston are tied 440 with one game remaining

For purposes of the tie breaker you only count the first three games in
each city Therefore Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 43
and theres probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston
and Quebec which means Boston has probably already won
