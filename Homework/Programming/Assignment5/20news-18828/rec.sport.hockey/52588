		With the kind of team Montreal has now  they can take the
cup easily  The only problem they have right now is that everyone is
trying to steal the show and play alone  They need some massive teamwork
	They are also in a little of a slump because longtime hockey
Montreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it was
rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21
years  But I know that is no excuse  But if the Habs manage to get some
good teamwork and get into the spirit  they should have no problem
winning in May

   I agree I also think Roy needs a good kick sometimesthat horrible
40 loss to the Capitals last weekyeeeech

   Heres to Cup 23this year
