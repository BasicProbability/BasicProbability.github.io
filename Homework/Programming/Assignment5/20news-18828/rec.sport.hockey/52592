16   Albany New York Boise IdahoA couple of cities with fair interest
but size and closeness to other teams is a question

Albany has their AHL franchise though it goes by the Capital District label
but Boise  Forget it  The CHL made an attempt at that part of the country in
198384 with a franchise in Great Falls  and no one showed up  Folks up in
that part of the PNW just arent interested in hockey

Hey Patrick the Montana Magic played in Billings not Great Falls

PLH I know where Id put the next two NHL expansion teams Phoenix and
Houston assuming the Whalers dont pack up and move in the meantime

Marc Phoenix and Houston it is
