TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send 4 players  15 million including Vin Damphousse 
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa and Ottawa will give its first round pick to Montreal


Obviously some reporter for the Ottawa Sun got taken by an April
Fools jokeprobably started by someone with the Nordiques or the
Bruins  

Like for examplewho is going to reimburse the Flyers for the
15 million they paid to the Nordiqueslike the Senators are
going to get Lindros and 15 million  The Flyers sent the
equivalent of 6 or 7 players when you include the draft choices
to Quebec and they are going to get only four back

Some reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a
real good laugh seeing as how the so much of the sports media
has chosen to publicize this utter nonsense

If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose 1st overall  Can Ottawa afford Lindros salary


Can you thinkit cannot possibly be trueno need for the if

Personally I cant see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything  
They didnt give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away 
again  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a huge draw in
Phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the 
franchise
 
Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players 15 from Montreal
for the pick
 

I cant believe that anyone would consider giving such crap even
the remotest consideration
