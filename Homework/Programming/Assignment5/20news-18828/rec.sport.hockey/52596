I dont understand why so many people are predicting an upset against 
Pittsburgh The team has won 12 in a row coming into the playoffs 
Theyve won practically every game that theyve really wanted to win 
all year including critical victories against the Caps and one 
against a hot Bruins team at the Gaahden The team is probably at 
its peak stronger than the previous 2 Stanley Cup winners I mean I 
know they can lose but it would be a large upset I personally 
think teams are going to be hard pressed to win 1 or 2 games in any 
series against the Pens and Im not a Pittsburgh fan


I have to agree here  As I heard on TSN tonight You want to pick
someone else but you just dont see how you can  And Im a Bruins
fan  Maybe this year will be different but it doesnt look good
Time will tell though
