Subject ReRe Trade rumor MontrealOttawaPhillie

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported    
tht Montreal will send 4 players  15 million including Vin 
Damphousse and Brian Bellows to Philldelphia Phillie will send 
Eric Lindros to Ottawa and Ottawa will give its first round pick 
to Montreal

Personally I cant see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything    
  
 Here we go again Is this the same idiot who posted the Gretzky     
 trade to Toronto               

Listen ASSHOLE Im just commenting on what I heard 
reported on the sports news

Youll notice my skeptical comment  Sheesh I thought this group 
wasfor conversation  Guess I was wrong
