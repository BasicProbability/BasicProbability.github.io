Subject Re Too Many Europeans in NHL

In article rauser734062608sfuca rauserfrasersfuca Richard John Rauser writes


   Ten years ago the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now Going into the 199293 season the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats

Canadians 400
Americans 100
Europeans 100


   Heres the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick

You know youre absolutely right  I think we should round up all those
players of European descent and ship em back to where they came from  Lets
see with whom should we start  I dunno Lemieux  Hmmmsounds like he
has French blood in him  Hey  France is part of Europe  Send that
Euroblooded boy back

Sheesh

    Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

    I just dont want them on mine

I dont think it would be hard to find some Native Americans or Native
Canadians for that matter who would dispute your claim to this great 
continent of ours  Ya see if you believe the anthropologists were all
immigrants of some sort  If you really dont think that Mogilny Bure
Selanne et al have improved the NHL then Im not sure you understand the
game
