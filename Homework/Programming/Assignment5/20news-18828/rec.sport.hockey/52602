Subject Re Too Many European in NHL

RA    Heres the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL 
R I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian 
RA team lets say the Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names 
R like Bure Konstantinov and Borshevshky Is this North America 
RA isnt it
 
I disagree  I think the NHL should feature the best hockey talent in
the world  regardless of nationality  I have to admit that when I 
see players like Gretzky and Messier traded off to the US because the
Canadian teams cant afford them I have been know to say only half
seriously that wed probably be better off if we had our own Canadian
hockey league for Canadian players 

RA Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let 
RA te Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent    

RA
