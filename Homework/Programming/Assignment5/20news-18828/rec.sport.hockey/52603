  Would Kevin Dineen play for the Miami Colons
 As a Flyers fan I resent you making Kevin Dineen the butt of your
 jokes
 Aw just take a moment to digest it and Im sure youll see the humour
If anybody is having problems following the thread be sure to ask the
origonal poster to rectify your misunderstanding

	What about his rectum

Its bad jokes like that which draws crohns I mean groans from the crowd
Dont bother looking it up in the appendix its useless anyway
         
Just one more word of advice

If you go to a Miami game stay away from any foods made with natural casings
