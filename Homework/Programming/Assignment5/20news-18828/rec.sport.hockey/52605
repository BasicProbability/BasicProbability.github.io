Subject Re Too Many Europeans in NHL Eurobashing

   Heres the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team lets say the
Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
Borshevshky Is this North America or isnt it Toronto Detriot Quebec
and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well 
 
    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way Im not a
Canucks fan to begin with  
 
    Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and
some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who arent even
better hockey players Its all hype This European mystique is sickening
but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league
 
    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse
 
    Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent
 
    I just dont want them on mine
 
 
	Ah so now were into European player bashing  What next  
No more French Canadiens  Yeah theres an idea  Let them French
speaking Canadiens have their own hockey league  We dont want them
	Are you CRAZY  The NHL is one of the true international
leagues and yes there ARE many Europeans who deserve to play in
the NHL and are better than some North Americans look at Teemu
I for one am glad to see Europeans in the NHL and I hope the
NHL soon expands to Europe  Its nice to see all these different
people come together to form the soon to be 26 hockey teams
