 I am originally from New York State and I go to school
 in North Carolina  Yet I dont constantly gripe about
 the lack of hockey  Wouldnt some of you who chose to go
 to school in the South realize most who gripe are Clemson students
 that hockey isnt quite as popular in South Carolina
 when you chose a school
 
 Why did you all excuse me  yall choose schools in
 the South if hockey was this important to you  
 
 Not everyone has the luxury of deciding on a college by making sure the 
 hockey coveraage is what you want it to be  I am a Pittsburgh transplan
 to S C when at home and the coveraage sucks  Sports south didnt
even show
 the final game of the Stanley Cup laast year while it was happening  They
 put it on ktape delay and cut the intermissions then went off the air  
 When you move you take the good with the bad and deal with it  it doesnt
 mean thaat you cant complain about it
 
I was transplanted by my parents from the Greater Hartford area to the
Greater Cleveland Ohio area  This was not an action of my choice  The
only hockey coverage I could get there regularly was Red Wings and Penguins
explaining in part why I follow these teams today  In Cleveland you
couldnt even find hockey scores on the 11 oclock news because they
figured that if they didnt have it it wasnt a sport
 


At least your parents didnt move you Idaho  The only things that get
any coverage there are football basketball and baseball
