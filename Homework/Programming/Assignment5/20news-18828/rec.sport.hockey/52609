When talking about hockey broadcasters lets give a moment of silence to
remember the St Louis Blues great Dan Kelly Many of you may have heard
him in the late 60s and early 70s on CBS He used to do Hockey Night In
Canada intermissions with another recently deceased great Danny Gallivan
of the Canadiens


I loved Dan Kelly  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back
in 1980 or so  No he wasnt always spot on top of the play and he
wasnt overly cute but those pipes  That lusty barrel chested voice
No pipsqueak was he unlike some fellas we know

I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the
Bus  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them  But Ill never
forget the night a year later when the Oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium the smoke from a million sparklers the long emptynet
goal near the end and Dan Kelly letting the crowds reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds then that voice barking through the din
Dave Lumley  sews it up for Edmonton  It sounds stupid but that
early for me hockey memory will always bring a thrill  Since then
Ive grown a lot more jaded about the game but I was really saddened
by Dan Kellys passing  He was one of the good guys
