 Fencesittinglook at Phillys record with Eric and without
 there is no doubt  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise

Re Eric True but fortunately we didnt get to find out what they would be
like without Recchi for 30 games

Soderstrom Absolutely 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot
of defense in front of him Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring
a ton over their career best But Galley thinks hes Paul Coffey puts scoring
ahead of defending and Fedyk has tailed off big time

Eklund Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries 42
points in 49 games is not bad at all and recently hes been a huge factor
in the wins theyve gotten Eklund has never had a point a game season in
his career his production is very typical for him How does he qualify as
a disappointment If anything hes a surprise

My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players
but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a 1 goalie My biggest
disappointment is Bill Dineen I thought that he was going to be the perfect
coach for this young team instead hes made too many bad moves and IMHO
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year Any
coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a
bright idea needs to go back to coaching school
