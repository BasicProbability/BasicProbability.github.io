Game Summary

If the FLYERS played like this every night theyd be in the playoffs this
year The FLYERS hit everything that moved They created scoring chance after
scoring chance They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do

Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal
He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead
of taking the shot he found BrindAmour crashing the net on the other side
A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppas body should have been a
goal but Puppa made a great save reading the play

Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked Doug Gilmour at 425 The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill The
Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept
away every rebound

After the power play the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play Rod BrindAmour
gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the
net Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef
Beranek and Bob Rouse who were wrestling in the slot Beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for
a 10 FLYERS lead at 810

The FLYERS kept the pressure on and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS
from building on their lead for a while Eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed Each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies
were strong Bowen started giving some Lindroslike checks in his own corners
Then Lindros who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him thought he had
a chance to even the score He had Foligno lined up at center ice leaned into
him and rode him into the center ice boards The only problem was that Foligno
was a little far from the boards and Mike Mister McGeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 1538

The Leafs couldnt get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were
very aggressive for a change on the kill

With time running out in the period Recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leafs blue line They were in
a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun Lindros tried a backhand pass
to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi but then Clark
checked Recchi off the puck Macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and
went right to McGill who had manned the point He drove it from just inside
the blue line Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at 19551 Shots were 138 FLYERS in the period

The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk
tripped up Rod BrindAmour in his offensive zone During the power play the
FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric
gloved it down but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head We
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end As time was
running out in the advantage Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but Puppa made the save The rebound kicked back to the right corner where
Recchi picked it up passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle
and Eric onetimed past Puppa at 755 With the assist Recchi moves past
Bobby Clarkes 7475 season the second best one season total for a FLYER at
117  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points

Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 830 to give the FLYERS another chance on
the power play Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with
a slash at 919 Not much happened on the 4 on 4 although the Leafs had most
of the possession The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play Tempers
flared a little at 1314 Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors Keith Acton
got a bloody face Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a
hooking minor at 1346 to set up a 4 on 3 The replay showed that Hawgoods
stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell
Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play led by Dimitri Yushkevich
Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson Berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball He had the puck at the point
and just trickled a pass down the slot He made all the FLYERS look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net
but Soderstrom stoned him

The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didnt
get anything home Shots were 1310 FLYERS

The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period and they
decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a
little

The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the
period but couldnt get past Puppa Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making
road kill out of them and tempers flared 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros 
unsportsmanlike conduct and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill roughing
all at 702 Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 751 on Gilmour

Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play

At about the 12 minute mark Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through Soderstrom The puck was rolling on its side and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other Seconds later Rod BrindAmour tripped up Gilmour at 1224 to give the
Leafs another chance on the power play On the advantage after Soderstrom
stoned Andreychuk while lying down Andreychuk got the rebound through
Soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen They kept the pressure on but Soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout

Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at 1601 No punches thrown Recchi got the initial minor Krushelnyski
Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors At 1702 Rouse and Beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to
set up another 4 on 4 Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS
zone as they were battling for the puck and while McGill was down he ran
his stick across McGills face The FLYERS were not happy with that at all
58 Al Conroy paired up with 61 Berehowski and started throwing punches
Upward Well Al held his own much to the delight of the crowd Each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head and Al got a standing O
Penalties Eastwood 5 cross check  game Clark Carkner 10 each Berehowski
and Conroy 5 each fighting at 1749

So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS The had no interest
in stting on the lead Hawgood Galley and BrindAmour played catch until
Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and
blasted it past Puppa at 1839

That was all the fireworks Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot Puppa
did but kept the FLYERS off the board 40 FLYERS shots were 98 FLYERS in the
3rd Probably the strongest game Ive seen from the FLYERS since the All Star
break Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom all since 110 Tied for 2nd most in
the NHL but hes played fewer games than Belfour 6 or the goalie I cant
remember that hes tied with

Next up its the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg The FLYERS cannot
be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night
in Washington would be the official end

FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games Last year they had 75 points
in 80 games 5 under 500 so they need at least 8 points in their last 6
games to improve on that only by percentage points 5 under in 84 is better
than 5 under in 80

Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left The tragic number for 5th
is 5 points I watched the Rangers blow a 42 third period lead at home to
lose 54 before I finished this up Why 5 points instead of 4 Well the FLYERS
will win the tiebreaker if they catch them whereas the Islanders win tie
breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie The Rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the Devils the Pens twice the FLYERS and
finish up with 2 games against the Caps So I guess 5th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on
