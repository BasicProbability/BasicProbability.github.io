Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on himRoger he is a FORWARD  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway  Lets put it another way  John Cullens 
is terrible  Whats your excuse for him  That his powerplay points dont
count  Neither do Selannes 
 
 Are you comparing Cullen to Salami  I would say that that is valid  If
 Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami
 stand around the other teams blueline when the puck is in his own end

  I thought that he was comparing Cullen to TEEMU SELNNE I always thought
  that salami is some sort of sausage BUT IF YOU dear Roger ARE ABLE TO
  SEE SALAMI ON THE ICE PLAYING HOCKEY I dont know what to do but you
  surely should do something and very quickly

  Maybe you think that if you keep on talking some rubbish after some time
  everybody will consider it to be really true You should take care of
  your LEAFS they surely need it more
  
 
What he does best is scoreso I refer you to my comment above
 
 Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
 can play a solid twoway game  I would have to say that this style
 of contribution would be more conducive to winning  Or dont you 
 think so

  At least we have seen him playing 
 
As it is now Selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck  Did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  You would think the
Messiah had returned

 During the latest Philly game the Leaf players didnt parade Philly
 crunched them 40   Maybe you need some more two way players who can
 score too 
 
 
 cordially as always
