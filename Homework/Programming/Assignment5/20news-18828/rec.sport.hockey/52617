 I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs biggest
 surprises and biggest disappointments this year Now these are just
 my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
 opportunity to see all the teams the same amount Anyway
   
 MVP  most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
       in terms of leadership cant win without him
   
 Biggest surprise  the player who rose above expectation  the player
       that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even
       if that new level doesnt necessarily warrant an allstar berth
       includes those players who at the outset of the season may not
       even have been in the teams plans
    
 Biggest disappointment  the player from whom we expected more eg I
       picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on
       offence brought by Demers shouldnt Savard have done better
