Subject Re Spelling Error on the Stanley Cup

   I was reading a newspaper tidbit that mentioned that there is a
 grammatical error on the Stanley Cup This newspaper The 
 Union Leader  Manchester New Hampshire stated that one of the
 years that the New York Islanders won the cup the printing on the
 actual cup stated New York Ilanders Can anyone verify this I
 forgot the exact year that this supposedly occured Any diehard
 Islander fans know about this The reason why I am asking is
 because the paper is not very reliable we call it The Union
 Misleader

Speaking of spelling errors on the Cup I wonder if the h in
Pittsburgh made it to the Cup  You know how funny people can
be about spelling Pittsburgh
