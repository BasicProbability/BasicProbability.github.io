Subject Re Too Many Europeans in NHL

rauserfrasersfuca Richard John Rauser writes



   Ten years ago the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now Going into the 199293 season the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats

Canadians 400
Americans 100
Europeans 100

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams My source is the Vancouver Sun

   Heres the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team lets say the
Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
Borshevshky Is this North America or isnt it Toronto Detriot Quebec
and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well 

Is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about Pavel Bure the
Russian Rocket I will completely throw up As it is now every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will crosscheck Bure into the 
plexiglass so hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher By the way 
Im not a Canucks fan to begin with  

Okay the stretcher remark was a little carried away But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians and
some Americans It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans who arent even
better hockey players Its all hype This European mystique is sickening
but until NHL owners get over it Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating the problem is clearly
only getting worse

And where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans Dont say
that the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game
I mean look at the way you play these days Less fights and more hockey
Imho canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the
70s when the game was more brute than beauty

    Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

Oh look You dont like Finns either

    I just dont want them on mine
Too bad almost all of you northamericans originates from europe

Hmmm And what kind of a name is Rauser Doesnt sound very canadian to
me 

PS When analyzing teams like Italy France and Great Britain you find that
a lot of their players are Canadians with double citizenship DS
