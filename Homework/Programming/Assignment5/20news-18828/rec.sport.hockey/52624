You know youre absolutely right  I think we should round up all those
players of European descent and ship em back to where they came from  Lets
see with whom should we start  I dunno Lemieux  Hmmmsounds like he
has French blood in him  Hey  France is part of Europe  Send that
Euroblooded boy back


Dont you Americans study historythe French settled in North America
as early or before the BritishLemieux can probably trace back his
North American heritage back a lot further than most of us
