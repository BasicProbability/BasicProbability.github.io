Subject Re Too Many Europeans in NHL

In article rauser734062608sfuca rauserfrasersfuca Richard John Rauser writes


   Ten years ago the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now Going into the 199293 season the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats

Canadians 400
Americans 100
Europeans 100

Xenophobic trash deleted

    Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent

    I just dont want them on mine

If youre going to go to those extremes I guess youd better start 
packing  Because unless youre a Native North American this isnt
your continent either
