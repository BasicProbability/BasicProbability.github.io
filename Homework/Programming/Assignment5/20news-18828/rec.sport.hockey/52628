Subject Re What was Ray doing

In yesterdays fracus between Rob Ray and Brent Hughes was it the camera angle or was
Ray actually punching Hughes where it appeared he was punching him For those that didnt
see the game  it was several inches below the belt and he punched him there quite a few
times Dreadful

Also why did Poulin get four minutes


Ive been watching  playing hockey for a good long time now and
Ive seen players with questionable tactics but never have I seen
what Ray did on Sunday This guy gets my all time loser award Its
one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck
when they are down its another thing to have a fist fight with
someones balls Ray should be thrown out of the league what an
ahole
