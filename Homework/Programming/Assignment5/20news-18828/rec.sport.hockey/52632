Subject USENET Playoff Pool

As Ive mentioned in the rules posting I will be out of town until the
day before the entry deadline so I wont be able to respond to your
messages until April 18

I would be grateful if someone could repost the rules and instructions for
the playoff pool sometime next week for the benefit of those who missed the
first two postings

Thanks
