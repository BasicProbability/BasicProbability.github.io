Subject Re Too Many Europeans in NHL 

In article rauser734062608sfuca rauserfrasersfuca Richard John Rauser writes

    Heres the point there are far too many Europeans in the NHL I am sick
 of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team lets say the
 Red Wings and the Canucks and seeing names like Bure Konstantinov and
 Borshevshky Is this North America or isnt it Toronto Detriot Quebec
 and Edmonton are particularly annoying but the numbers of Euros on other
 teams is getting worse as well

    Im sick too watching allamerican names like GRETZKY etc

    Which names you accept  Sitting bull and dances with wolves 

    It is North America What are you doing here
