From kkellermailsasupennedu Keith Keller
Subject Observations

On the Lindros trade  Like Ottawa would be stupid enough to get
Lindros  Why do you think Quebec traded him  Lindros would go on
personal strike againmaybe I should talk to Ottawa mgmt about
arranging such a trade  

On that xenophobe  Thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly  Maybe we
should look at baseball the supposed American pasttime sp  Look at
all the damn Latin Americans playing there  They should all be deported 
They arent American  add sarcasm to taste

To Roger  Wow for once we agree  I hope this isnt a sign of things to
come Ill become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the
Leafs being the best in the Campbell  

On the Rangers  I told someone that nothing that happened in the Patrick
would surprise me anymore  I lied  How the hell can a team go into
Washington earn a shutout then come back home and lose to pitiful
Hartford  The absolute pinnacle of mediocrity  I cant stand it
From what Ive read the goalie is to blame this time as Beezer played
pretty poorly  Smith is talking about calling up Corey Hirsch from
Binghamton everybody is pointing fingers this is definitely not the
same team which wanted to prove itself in Washington  Now nothing that
happens in the Patrick will surprise me  Yeah right
