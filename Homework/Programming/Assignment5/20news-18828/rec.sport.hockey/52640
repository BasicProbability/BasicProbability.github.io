			   MVP		  Surprise	  Disappointment
			   
 New York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev         Bourque
		           Gartner	  Zubov		  Bourque


Bourque  the Penguins GM must laugh his head off every time he thinks
of the Rangers and this loser

 I hope in the future Americans are thought of as a warlike      
 vicious people because then I bet a lot of high schools would   
 pick Americans as their mascot

Please  Have a care with Phil  We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh  He
didnt score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his
butt off  It was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive
zone that allowed the Pens to utilize his potential  I havent been
paying attention to him this year so I cant say I know what youre 
objecting to  He has been out with injuries though hasnt he  And
if the offense isnt there theres not much his speed will do for you
Like I said he created opportunities but he didnt score much  I thought
the money offered from the Rangers was a little high and so did the Pens
I guess
