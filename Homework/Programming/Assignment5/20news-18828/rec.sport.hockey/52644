True rumor  Fact  A big three way deal

Eric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators  And Senators get 15mill from
Montreal

Montreal gets Alexander Daigle the first round pick from Senators

Philly gets Damphousse Bellow Patrick Roy and a draft pick

Sheesh  The rumor mill strikes again  But lets just assume this were true
My question is this

What would Montreal give San Jose if the Sharks got first pick and took Daigle
