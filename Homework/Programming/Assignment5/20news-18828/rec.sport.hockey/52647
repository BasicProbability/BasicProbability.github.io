Of course we need new position names for those unable to remember the 
very complicated hockey terminology

Old Name	New Name
		

Centre		The Guy in the Middle
Left Wing	The Guy on the Left
Right Wing	The Guy on the Right
Defenceman	The Guy Back There
Goaltender	The Guy in the Net or cage as my mother calls it
Referee		The Guy with the Whistle
Linesman	The Guy with the Arms
Coach		The Guy in the Suit
GM		The Head Guy
Puck		The Black Thing
Red Line	The Line in the Middle
Blue Line	The Line on the Side
Crease		The Place in front of the Guy in the Net
Faceoff Circle	The Round Thing Where They Stand
Slot or Point	Over There must point to accompany term
Bench		The Place Where They Sit
Penalty Box	The Place Where They Sit When Theyre Bad

Mr Bettman	The Guy in the Wrong Sport
Mr Stein	The Guy Who Should Be In Charge But Isnt

Of course we also need new names for the individual awards and other
stuff like the Presidents Cup

Presidents Cup		The Trophy Given To the Best RegularSeason Team
Hart winner		The Most Valuable Player chosen from the
				Guys in the Middle the Guys on the
				Right the Guys on the Left the Guys
				Back There and the Guy in the Net
				though typically given only to the
				Guys in the Middle and the Guys on 
				the Left and on the Right
Norris winner		The Best Guy in the back or the Guy who was
				awarded for something even though he
				is not one of the Guys in the Middle
				or on the Left or the Right

ad nauseum
