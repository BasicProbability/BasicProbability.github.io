		With the kind of team Montreal has now  they can take the
cup easily  The only problem they have right now is that everyone is
trying to steal the show and play alone  They need some massive teamwork
 
This is known as the Savard syndrome  and we are talking Denis not Serge
No team will ever win squat with the likes of Denis Savard in their lineup
 
 
They could tell Savard to stay home and watch the games on TV

If life were so simple  Savard has not played in three of the last 
four games and they are still playing like crap  Montreals problems
run deeper than Savard and Mouton unfortunately I hope they can
get their act together before the playoffs

The lineup in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be
the one theyre likely to use for the playoffs  Lets hope they can
forget about the nice weather were having and play hockey
