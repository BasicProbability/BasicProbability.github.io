Anyways crawl back into the hole you crawled out ofthe NBA doesnt
care where they get basketball players from major league baseball
doesnt give a damn where they get baseball players from except Cuba
that is

MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba  They just have to
defect first  

Sort of like the situation used to be with RussianCzechetc hockey
