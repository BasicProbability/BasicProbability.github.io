MIGHTY ONES GET MIGHTIER

TPS the Finnish Champions 19923 are getting still stronger

Oh no  Say it isnt so


BTW Is Juha Ylnen centre HPK drafted by the Jets During last year
he has reached the top level among Finnish centres He had very good
playoff games against TPS

Yes Ylnen is a draft choice of the Jets  Assuming of course this
is the same Ylnen that played for KiekkoEspoo in 199091  He was a
5th round 91st overall pick of the Jets in the 1991 entry draft

I noticed in the summaries that Ylnen had really begun to play well in
the playoffs
