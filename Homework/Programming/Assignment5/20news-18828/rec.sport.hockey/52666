For those of you who can only decide which team is best after you have
seen the standings

TOR  42 25 11  95   609
CHI  42 25 11  95   609
DET  44 28  9  97   599
VAN  41 28  9  91   583

No team in the Campbell Conference has a better record than Toronto
 
  Thats true but according to your stats Chicago has just as good a
record as Toronto  Its interesting that you should list Toronto ahead
of Chicago
