Subject Barasso  the cheap shot master

After watching the Pengiuns all year and as many other teams as
possible Ive really noticed an increase in Tom Barassos cheap shots
this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other
goaltenders Ive also noticed that he usually gets away with it Just
as examples last night I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the
head which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens
Scott and Tocchet 2 minute minors He also KICKED John McLean Of
course he wasnt called for that Isnt kicking an automatic match
penalty and 10 game suspension I think Glenn Anderson got one a few
years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest Theres no doubt in
my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall Hes also
very good

How about that Tocchet headbutt Is there an automatic susppension that
goes along with a nonkicking match penalty I cant remember anymore

Oh the playoffs should be fun
