more about the MessierSamuelsson incident
While this is true strictly speaking it was the Rocksteady replicant who
initially used his stick illegally to measure Messiers ribcage There is no
question in my mind from seeing the replay in slomo that Ulf2000 was
coming at Messier with intenttohasta la vista in mind and should have
been gone for that 

 I agree with Rick that Ulfs cross check wasnt illegal It was the kind
 of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called Slomos
 sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are
 Besides if Messier cant take the heat he should stay out of the kitchen

So Staffan how is Mattias Timmander doing this year And any impression
on Markus Czeriew lost my roster list on Hammerby Does it look like
they will make it to the Eliteserien for next year And then get stomped
if Markus goes to Boston

 Well Matt Mattias Timmander hasnt been playing with the MoDo elite league
 team yet just the MoDo junior team so I predict he needs a few more years
 here before he can join the Bs I saw him play in the Swedish championship
 game for junior players this year and he played very well a physical game
 but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does I suspect you would like to
 have a Ulf typeofplayer on the Bs team too 
 As for Mariusz Czerkawski he has had a great season for Hammarby in
 division 1 He scored if I remember correctly 93 points this season
 and then we have to keep in mind that a 50 point season in Sweden is
 considered very good due to the limited number of games Mariusz is
 Djurgarden property he was just on loan to Hammarby so he will play
 in Elitserien next season unless the Bs can get him of course
 I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
 watch in Swedish hockey this season
