I didnt say every team MUST have a number of local players Rather the
European teams should get the CHANCE to sign their top players before the rest
of the league comes in I agree that birthplace isnt that important
Dusseldorfer EG of the German league average close to 10000 fans and they
dont have a single Germanborn forward Lion Milan made the European Final
Four with fifteen Canadianborn players But nationality is going to be an
issue in Sweden and Finland I think We really need an issue preventing
Lindros and Mario from ending up being drafted by a European team and vice
versa Player trades are a different matter  any player can end up anywhere
after being drafted

DEG has many germanborn forwards in the team In fact the majority of players
are germanborn 199293 DEG had 11150 average in 11800 spectator arena
