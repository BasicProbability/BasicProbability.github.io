Well if things were different and I had my way the headline would be NHL
European Division regular season game Stockholm Storm vs Helsinki Tornado
43 Two games against every North Americanbased team 46 in all and this
might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between Helsinki
and Stockholm The remaining 27 games would involve Paris Dortmund Milan
A nice dream
