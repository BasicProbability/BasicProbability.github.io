Anyway this game continued a trend that has sadly been taking shape for
a couple of weeks now  I had hoped it was fatigue or an aberration but
I cant snow myself any longer  Alex Mogilny must be benched as a
disciplinary action and soon

His explanation for Ysebaert jumping between him and LaFontaine to score the
winning goal yesterday  Wasnt my guy ask Patty about it

Actually this stuff from Mogilny doesnt surprise me all that much  About 4
or 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex it went something
like sarcastically

Yep Pattys the man  Hes responsible for the teams successIm a 
nobody around here

I was going to post it at the timeI must have forgot since nobody else 
was talking about him being a problem

If I heard that in the locker room Id beat the shit out of him on the spot
Patty took responsibility in the press taking the heat off of Alex  Thats
because LaFontaine is the epitome of class and a consummate team player

Yep Id beat the shit out of him too  LaFontaine really must be a team
playermakes you wonder what the Islander management was thinking
My question is what the hell is Muckler doing  Whether he wishes to admit it
or not the team is his to coach and if he cant do the job then maybe the
job should be given to somebody who can  

Gee kinda like Alexs spot on the team isnt it
