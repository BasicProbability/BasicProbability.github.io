He was already offered 65 million for them from Northlands Coliseum
but refused the offer I dont think he is going to sale I think he
may decide to move the team to the States though where he can draw
more revenue from the team


Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office in Northlands and in the business community that the Oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey
revenues and expenses  That he did this was a good thingit is better
he complain early and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollarswhich would
truly jeopardize the franchise

Pocklingtons first option is not to sell or to move but to sell
a minority share of the team to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team and to get a better arena deal either in Northlands or
via a new building  Pocklington probably isnt going to get exactly
what he wantsbut ultimately he will probably get enough or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also

one has to remember Peter Pucks principleit is better to
spend other peoples money than ones own if at all possible
