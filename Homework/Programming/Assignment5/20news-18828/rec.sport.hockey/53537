Subject Re Winning Streaks

   You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak  That Pens streak
is a PLAYOFF streak tied by the Chicago Blackhawks who had won 11 in a row
until they met the Pens in the finals last year  The 18 game unbeaten so far
is a regular season unbeaten streak  But hey dont take it personally  Im a
Flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch  But with a healthy Lindros Recchi
Brindamour and Tommy Soderstrom theyll be there next year
By the way since the Flyers need defenseman what kind of trade would
anybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that

Terry Carkner wont be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook
paper would be better defense

Matt Weaver properly found at AJS147psuvmpsuedu  Hey at least were not
                                                       the Whalers
