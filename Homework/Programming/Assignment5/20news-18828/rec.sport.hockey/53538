Mathew Tasalloti says
chances this year but it seems to me like Washington is the ONLY
team that can stop the Penguins from winning their next Stanley Cup

  Really I think both the Islanders and Devils would have a better chance
at the Penguins than the Capitals IMO

 Robbie Po           PGH PENGUINS    It wont be easy but it
Contact for the 9394  91 STANLEY CUP    will have greater rewards
Penn State Lady Lions    92 CHAMPIONS      Mountains and Valleys are
rap115psuvmpsuedu     11 STRAIGHT WINS  better than nothing at all

Really  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot  They
couldnt even beat the Whalers in two games

Well since youre a Pens fans the whole question is moot  I think
the teams most likely to beat the Pens are the Bruins Nordiques and
Blackhawks but I dont think they can really do it
