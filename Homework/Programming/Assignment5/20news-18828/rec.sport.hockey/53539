The bottom line is the Bruins are the better team this year
Montreal fans have been screaming for years that their beloved Canadiens deserve
another cup Since the removal of the French Canadien rule they have been screaming
foul Welcome to league parity something the rest of the league has had for years
Even if the Habs do beat Boston in the playoffs they wont get by the Pens
I do agree with you Boston is the more taleneted team


The French Canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the
universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a
few yearsand really didnt have any substantial effect during that
period  The Canadiens Stanley Cup achievements were earned on a
level playing field
