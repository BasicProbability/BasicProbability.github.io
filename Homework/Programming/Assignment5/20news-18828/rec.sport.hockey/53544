Subject Re Barasso  the cheap shot master

After watching the Pengiuns all year and as many other teams as
possible Ive really noticed an increase in Tom Barassos cheap shots
this year and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other
goaltenders

Have a look at Ed Belfour

He also KICKED John McLean Of
course he wasnt called for that 

Belfour kicked Gerrard Gallant when the Wings played the Hawks
a couple of weeks ago No penalty No review No suspension
This was after he attacked Bob Probert in the previous period
He was penalized for that

Theres no doubt in
my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall
Hes also very good

Likewise Belfour Too bad he goes down so much
