  What makes you think so  Id like to understand your reasoning
  From my seat the Caps dont really appear to believe that they can 
  defeat Pittsburgh  Therefore they dont  I think their spirit was 
  broken in last years playoffs and hasnt really recovered  I dont know 
  what the season series numbers were but I believe that the Pens won it
  I think that either the Devils or the Islanders will cause more problems for
 
 
 What is this spirit crap  Im a Caps fan and hope they win
 if they end up facing Pittsburgh
 but I dont think the Caps lose to Pitt because of lack
 of spirit  Yes the Penguins won the season series against the
 Caps  Theyve won eighteen games in a row for Gods sake
 Did you ever think the Penguins might be good and thats
 why they win

I reread what I wrote and it didnt say exactly what I thought  

Sure the Pens are a better team  Theyve got size and the best skill players
in the league  Theyve also got the best clutch goaltending  Theyre the 
best team in the league

But my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the
Pens since last years choke  And thats the mental problem the one theyve
had for a number of years I tried to point out  Spirit mental preparedness
will to win whatever you want to call it its missing when the Caps play the
Pens  Actually youre right  it wont make any difference
