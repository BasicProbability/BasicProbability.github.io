Actually this stuff from Mogilny doesnt surprise me all that much  About 4

or 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex it went something
like sarcastically

Yep Pattys the man  Hes responsible for the teams successIm a 
nobody around here

I was going to post it at the timeI must have forgot since nobody else 
Gee kinda like Alexs spot on the team isnt it



How can you assume it was a sarcastic remark

For someone whose first language is not English I would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes Pat is the MVP on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players  Quite modest I might say
