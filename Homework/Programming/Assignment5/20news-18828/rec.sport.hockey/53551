   The Pens wont be playing Montreal because Boston will win Adams
   divisional play  Buffalo and Quebec will make decent showings
   Boston out of sheer determination will win a game against the Pens
   but no more  They have heart but the Pens have too many big guns and
   too many ways to win
 
    If Boston does indeed win the Adams nothing is certain and
 indeed gets to play the Pens then I think youll find a very
 different Boston team this year Boston will use every trick in the
 book to shut down the Pens offense  something they didnt even try
 last year The Pens weak spot is defense and goaltending  if Boston

First I enjoyed reading your post  Second I disagree with the Pens weak
spot being defense and goaltending  for a couple of reasons  Barrasso has
had a spectacular year  no slow start consistently sharp GAA  30 and 
leads the league in wins  Tommy deserves the Vezina  Given the lack of 
respect he commands though I doubt he will win it  The other reason 
concerns the Pens team defense  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the
fewest goals allowed  That is a big improvement for them and it indicates
that they are playing better team defense

 can shut down the Pens offense and get an early goal then you have a
 real game If the Pens score first then its practically over I
 dont think the Pens have the discipline to stick to the team game if
 theyre held scoreless 5 minutes into the second
 
    Boston doesnt have the guns of the Pens but the Pens doesnt have
 the defense goaltending and discipline of Boston Still Boston can
 put the puck in the net Remember that Boston is not a runandgun
 Patrickstyle team although they played runandgun hockey for the
 better part of the regular season who doesnt Even Neely backchecks
 all the way in behind his own net if necessary
 
    Penaltykilling will be a big factor Boston are I believe 2 over
 the last 40something shorthanded situations meaning they have
 scored 4 SHG while giving up 2 PPG one in a lackluster game against
 Ottawa
 
    Id say the series will go to 5 or 6 But Im much less certain
 whether it will be in favor of the Pens or the Bs Their styles going
 into the playoffs are too different to make it predictable Still Id
 place my bets on the Pens I think My prediction is that if the Bs
 can get the first goal in four of the games theyll take the series
 Otherwise the Pens will
 
    But Id rather wait and see whether the Bs will actually get out
 of the Adams to begin with Buffalo Quebec and Montreal arent
 exactly planning to call it a game and go home
