Does anyone know if all the Patrick division games are going to be televised
on ESPN and ABC If some games are going to be left outOr blanked out by
dumb southern ABC affiliates I was wondering if anyone out there knows
of any sports bars in Atlanta which are frequented by hockey fans I dont
want to miss out on any of the Pens games I am sure that there are some
Islander fansnow that the rangers are dead who would want to watch every
PensIslanders game in Atlanta


Circle TuesdayApril 20th on your TV calendar ESPN will carry Game2
from Pittsburghs Civic Arena or as they are advetising it  Pittsburgh vs
4th place Partick Div finisher Personally BruinsBuffalo or Montreal
Quebec City is a much better matchup but ESPN is hoping for a spoiler
in the Pens series which its not likely to get the way Mario has been
playing for the past month or so

Id personally prefer BuffaloBoston as a birthday gift from ESPN
but I dont think the folks at ESPN will accomodate that for me 
ESPN has this inexplicable affinity for the Patrick division it
seems
