  is a good stat because it is the only stat that I am aware of that
 takes into account defensive play  It isnt a measure of defensive
 play it takes into account offense and defence all aspects of play
                                                   
  If we are interested of real allround players the power play stats
  should be considered too Because the power play is also one aspect 
  of play There is still something to be done with these player evaluation
  tools

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points
 tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull
John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck

Given the opportunity to play power play consistently any player can
inflate his totals
