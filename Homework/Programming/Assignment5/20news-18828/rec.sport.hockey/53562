From umturne4ccuumanitobaca Daryl Turner
Subject My predictions

Smythe Division


Vancouver vs Winnipeg  Jets in 7
The Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games  Everyone is
healthy for the Jets  Im biased  

Calgary vs Los Angeles  Flames in 6
From what I have seen the Kings have looked flat lately  I just cant see
them getting by the Flames

Final Jets in 6
The Jets havent lost to the Flames in 93  They will but it will be a
close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered  I
dont think hell be 100 and while it will help it wont be enough

Norris Division


Chicago vs St LouisMinnesota
Chicago in 6 against the Blues 7 against the Stars  

Detroit vs Toronto  Wings in 6
The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk  Chelvadae is
more experienced than Potvin

Final  Hawks in 7  Brutal series  Probert and Chelios will go at it
Belfour is better than Chelvadae IMHO

Conference Final  Hawks in 6  It hurts but the Hawks are more experienced
and that will carry them through to the final

Prince of Wales Conference


Adams Division


Boston vs Buffalo  Bruins in 6
Bs can check Juneau is darn good and Neely  The Sabres rely too much
on Lafontaine and Mogilny

Quebec vs Montreal  Montreal in 7
Classic battle the inexperience will hurt the Nords this year

Final  Bruins in 5  Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords
and Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs

Patrick Division


Pittsburgh vs IslandersDevils  Pens in 5
One word  Mario

Washington vs DevilsIslanders  Caps in 6  Devils in 7
I think the Caps can beat the Isles but not the Devils  Tabaracci has been
strong in goal and if he plays like last year he could carry the team
It doesnt matter though

Final  Pens in 5  Two more words  Stevens  Jagr

Cup Final  Pens in 6  Three last words  Tocchet  Murphy  Barrasso

The only thing I dont like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to
be out in full force again  I dont mean the regular Penguin fansits
just like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post
like nuts while the Jets are winning but we wont hear from again when they
lose

Oh yeahnext years Cup predictionJets in 7 over the Nords
