 About 4 or 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex it
 went something like sarcastically
 Yep Pattys the man  Hes responsible for the teams successIm a 
 nobody around here

How can you assume it was a sarcastic remark
For someone whose first language is not English I would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes Pat is the MVP on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players  Quite modest I might say

Well I dont recall assuming anything except perhaps that the columnist 
who reported the incident was telling the truth ie the sarcastic impression
came from him Steve Simmons  Besides to my knowledge Alex has a pretty
fair grasp of the English languageand his recent comment after the Detroit
game would indicate that this remark is what I think it to be  Very low
