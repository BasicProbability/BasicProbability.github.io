If the Penguins get out of the Patrick they will win the
cup  However their hardest task is to get out of that division
Im sure that Washington will most definitly throw a rench into the
Penguin plans  Im a Canucks fan not that I think much of their
chances this year but it seems to me like Washington is the ONLY
team that can stop the Penguins from winning their next Stanley Cup

I was under the impression that the Penguins has had the Caps number for 
most of the season

Of course no one asked me I always interject my opinions on matters I have no
concern over

Go Islanders Playoffs here we come
Go Jets for 93



And last year the Capitals had the Pens number up until about game 3 of the playoffs
