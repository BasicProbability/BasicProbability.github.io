Mathew Tasalloti says
chances this year but it seems to me like Washington is the ONLY
team that can stop the Penguins from winning their next Stanley Cup

  Really I think both the Islanders and Devils would have a better chance
at the Penguins than the Capitals IMO

Really  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot  They
couldnt even beat the Whalers in two games

Yes but as has been mentioned many times before the Islanders play at
the talent level of their opponent  Since Hartford is pitiful the
Islanders played pitiful  Since Pittsburgh is great the Isles will most
likely play great  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor
shooting  To Greg yes I have noticed that the Islanders couldnt hit
the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of
it  Does anyone have shooting percentages  I dont know if that would
help since they often miss the net completely but it might shed some
light on the subject

And my playoff pool is running  Exact rules to be posted tomorrow but
dont hesitate to send in picks
