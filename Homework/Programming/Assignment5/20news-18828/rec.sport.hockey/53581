Subject Re plus minus stat

 It is meaningless to compare one players plusminus statistic with
 another players out of the context of the role and the playing time
 of the players involved    

Its just as meaningless to compare goals assists PIM and any other stat I
can think of  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams  And yet  awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats  The operative words are
in part  stats must be interpreted tempered with other information one
has about the player  


 To compare Jagrs and Franciss plusminus is ridiculous and absurd

And comparing Jagrs and Franciss points is just as ridiculous and absurd
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals assists points 
for Selanne Lindros Juneau Potvin and the other rookies in the league
and yet

How about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game
