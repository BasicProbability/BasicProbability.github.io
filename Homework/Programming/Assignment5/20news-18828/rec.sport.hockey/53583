On the first Hartford goal Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense Take the body and if
they get one shot and beat you fine Dont give them another chance Carkner
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this Ill bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play

Thats all I have my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored much less how

From what I heard Roussel had a very strong game After the game Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game It was Garry Galley 3 for his career high point total Im surprised
that a former goalie wouldnt look closer at his defensive play Tommy 
Soderstrom 2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 12 a season
and Mark Recchi 1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark
But heres the odd part He couldnt decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1 If he picks Recchi as 1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros doesnt that make Lindros 2

What You wanna know my three stars of the season Well since you asked

1 Eric Lindros Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice
The difference between the teams record with him and without him is no
accident I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it and I think that he will deservedly wear the C on his jersey
next season

2 Tommy Soderstrom 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour
and Tommy didnt have a Chris Chelios booo in front of him He also didnt
play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family
has a history of heart problems Theres no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years

3 Mark Recchi Again you cant argue with an alltime team high single season
scoring mark There are an awful lot of teams that didnt have a single player
get as many points Plus Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season
Not a tough choice

Honorable mentions Rod BrindAmour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year The difference was that he wasnt on the top line
this year and didnt get as much playing time Then again he didnt get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman Yes he made rookie
mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them I have a feeling
that with his shot hell score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone and I suspect that hell be the teams top defenseman
in years to come

Garry Galley was the teams point leader from defensemen Again there are some
things you just cant argue with And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution A little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total
But consistency became a problem for him

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below 500 in 5th place their best winning
percentage since going 500 in 198889 14203 within the division 4th in
Patrick 23145 at home They finished 17th overall will draft 10th in
next years entry draft Quebec had the 1st rounder though They scored as
many goals as they allowed 319

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them

I hope youve all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable
