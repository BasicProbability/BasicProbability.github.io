Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team  The owner of the Admirals sorry I cant remember his name
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center

Lloyd Pettit married into AllenBradley Corp abcom family and owns the
Admirals  He donated the Bradley Center and the new Pettit National Ice
Center

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 50 million was too
high

This is not the way I have heard it  See Lloyd as he is affectionately
referred to by Milwaukeeans and Bob Uecker bought the Bradley Center TO get
the NHL to come here

Like I said I dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
its true dont look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon  The Admirals
arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an NHL club
and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBAs
Milwaukee Bucks play there as well

Yeah the Bucks the Milwaukee Wave soccer the Admirals the Marquette
Warriors concerts and a bunch of other things
