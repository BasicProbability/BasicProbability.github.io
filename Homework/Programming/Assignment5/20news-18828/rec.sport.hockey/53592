All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at

excellent forwards and defensemen  Shooter in Richer an all around do
it all in Todd chef Stasnymaster of a thousand dishes power play

for yourselves

  Yup I agree with ya I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily SO I think
  all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams
  before voting I think Islanders and Quebec are much better then I had
  expected
