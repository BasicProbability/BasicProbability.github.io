Jutila was a failure I think while Makela and Ari Haanpaa had an
onagainoffagain career with the Islanders Both players had to play in the
minors Of course I like our players I just dont think the names
you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL Even Rexi in his prime was more
of a good regular in New YorkEdmonton than a superstar in his own right
although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf


Ruotsaleinen was a more than competent NHLerhis choice of where
to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability

He was crucial to the Oilers Stanley Cup victory in 1990 the one
without Gretzky because he made an Oiler power play which was
lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive  The
Oilers missed him more the following year than Kurri and I think
the Oilers would have make the finals if Ruotsaleinen has stayed
around the following season and would have beaten Pittsburgh
with Ruotsaleinen and a healthy Messierand delayed Pittsburghs
dynasty by a season
