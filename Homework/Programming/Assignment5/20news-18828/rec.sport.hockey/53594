Subject Re FLYERS notes 417



Could someone post the Flyers record with and without Eric Lindros in
the lineup


I have a guy that is trying to compare the QuebecFlyers trade to the 

DallasMinnesota trade in the NFLHershel Walker

I just need the stat to back up my point that Eric will be one of the next

great players

thanks
