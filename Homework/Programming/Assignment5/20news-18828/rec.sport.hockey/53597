Haa Thats one of the things I find most interesting in this 
newsgroup Its a good way of cluing into the collective wisdom of 
the average hockey fans That doesnt mean theyre always right 
however For example the Habs are going to come out of the Adams and 
hardly anyone believes that right now

  Its hard to be humble when youre perfect

Well as long as were being unduly cocky here Its obvious that the Pens
will cone out of the Patrick Division not the Caps and also that
they will win thier third Stanley Cup Collective Wisdom is a very polite
way of putting it I dont know if Id be so gracious
And for what its worth Probably not much I think the Habs will come out of
the Adams too
