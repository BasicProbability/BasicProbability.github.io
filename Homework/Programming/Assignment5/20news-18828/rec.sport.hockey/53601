did anyone else see this game last night  just like a playoff game
lots of hittingbut I was disappointed by the video goal judge
on all replays joe murphys goal shouldnt have counted  it didnt go in net
 and according to the tsn broadcasters the video goal judge said that he
saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assumed the puck went in
this is terriblehope crap like this doesnt occur in the playoffs
the game would have ended in 22 tie 

I thought the red light went onthus in the review the presumption
would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the
netfrom the replays I say even from the rear the evidence wasnt
conclusive that the puck was in or outin my opinion

It seemed pretty conclusive to me  The puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line  And the announcers admittedly homers
kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs
because it was obvious to them and I would have thought to anyone who
saw the replay that the puck didnt go in  The referee originally 
signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored  This to me is
unheard of  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the Leaf chances this year

cordially as always
