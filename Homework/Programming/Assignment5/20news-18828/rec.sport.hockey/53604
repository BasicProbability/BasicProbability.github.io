From The Always Fanatical Patrick Ellis IO11330MAINEMAINEEDU
Subject Keenan signs Plus WALSH


Well I just read in the Boston Globe that while not confirming
or denying anything Walsh may end up with the Rangers organizations
as an assistant Coach  Keenan has talked with Walsh in the past
he came up to see Kariya as he will be coaching him in the worlds
funny I guess he got to watch the Ferraro brothers as well Im
not sure if walsh will go but if Keenan is getting 700000 and walsh
even gets 100000 thats a 30 pay raise for walsh not to mention
a nice career move Anyone from New York Hear anything about
this
