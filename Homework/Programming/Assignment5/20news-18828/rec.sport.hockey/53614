Locked away waiting for the tapedelay to start 

Its nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network
television  too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on
WABCAM for an earlyseason Yankees baseball game

Its a 122 win by the Texas Rangers  and theyre delaying the
tapedelay by another halfhour for the ballgame highlights
