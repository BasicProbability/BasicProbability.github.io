 The subject line says it all  Is it terribly difficult to get tickets
 to Penguins games especially now that they are in the playoffs  Would
 it be easy to find scalpers outside of the Igloo selling tickets

     Here is my traditional experience with tickets playoffs and otherwise
at the Civic Arena

     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena  Best 
strategy given that you dont mind missing the Anthem which is OK if BE
Taylor decides to come back ever again   is to wait until 740 or 745
when the game is rolling the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets

     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on 
whats left at 745 may be nosebleed material D E sections

Others can add on their opinions as well
