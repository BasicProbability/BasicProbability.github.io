 Locked away waiting for the tapedelay to start 
 
 Its nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network
 television  too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on
 WABCAM for an earlyseason Yankees baseball game
 
 Its a 122 win by the Texas Rangers  and theyre delaying the
 tapedelay by another halfhour for the ballgame highlights
 
You think thats bad  Im in Bowling Green OH and we get ABC from
Toledo  Well the cable co decided to totally preempt the game no tape
delay no nothing for a stupid telethon  Hockey is very big around here
too  I had to listen to my Penguins win on my car radio out in the
parking lot  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230
miles from Pittsburgh the reception usually isnt good at all  I cant
believe I picked it up during the middle of the day
