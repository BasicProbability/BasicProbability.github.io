goaltending from Ed Belfour Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the
stretch to preserve the Blues lead

The Hawks came out strong in the first period outshooting the Blues 61 and
taking a 10 lead on Noonans first goal Right after an interference penalty
on Rick Zombo had expired Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the

a long slap shot and Noonan deflected the puck between Josephs pads After
the goal the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks
109 in the first period

Jeff Brown tied the game 11 at 312 of the second Nelson Emerson broke in on
the left side got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot Belfour
came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards where Brown
collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal

Two minutes later on a Hawks power play Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a
shorthanded breakin Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy
Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass
across the slot Noonan fired it past Joseph at 530 for the 21 lead

Noonan completed his hat trick 311 later to increase the Hawks lead to 31
Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat
Stephane Quintal by driving to the net Joseph had no chance as Noonan
deflected the puck in the net

Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 31 at 1249 after picking up the
rebound of Basil McRaes slap shot from the slot Janney set up McRae for
the shot and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to Felsner Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net The Blues
outshot the Hawks 105 in the second period

With the Blackhawks leading 32 at 956 of the third Stephane Matteau picked
up a high sticking penalty Just 53 seconds into the power play Steve Smith

The Blues didnt waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into
the twoman advantage to tie the game 33 Janney found Hull in the slot
and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour Jeff Brown collected the rebound and
passed it to Shanahan in the left circle Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp
angle

Just 17 seconds later Hull scored the game winner for the Blues Nelson
Emerson broke in on right wing carried the puck behind the net along with
two Hawks defensemen Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the
slot and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 43

The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes but Joseph
made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring He stopped Troy
