Locked away waiting for the tapedelay to start 

I think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed  Lemieux
two Tocchet Mullen Tippett and Jagr  I buzzed my friend because I forgot
who had scored Mullens goal  I said Who scored  Lemieux two Tocchet
Tippett Jagr  The funny part was I said the Jagr part nonchalantly as
he was in the process of scoring while I was asking this question 

All in all ABCs coverage wasnt bad  On a scale of 110 I give it about
an 8  How were the games in the ChiSt LouisLA area

Its nice that the Devils are starting out their playoffs on network
television  too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on
WABCAM for an earlyseason Yankees baseball game

Thats stupid  Id complain to the television network  If I were to even
see a Pirates game on instead of a Penguins game at this time of the year I
and many other Pittsburghers would surely raise hell

Its a 122 win by the Texas Rangers  and theyre delaying the
tapedelay by another halfhour for the ballgame highlights

Texas is off to a good start they may pull it out this year  Whoops  That
belongs in recsportbaseball
