2Red Wings vs 3Maple Leafs               Maple Leafs in 6

  Comment  Its kind of tough to rely on Yzerman as the teams main weapon
            Hes a great palyer but Dino knows all about choking which
            puts the burden on Steve even more  Potvins had a hell of a
            season and goaltending is what you need in the playoffs

For a great prognosticator you seem to remember very little playoff
history Dino always shows up in the playoffs which is why he is a
great sleeper pick in pools Dont forget about Fedorov one of the
top players in the NHL IMHO and Coffey who has the most Stanley Cup
rings of any active players correct me if Im wrong Wings in a
cakewalk

Oh yeah how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick
Division  He choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in
the second round two years ago  He rarely if ever makes it out of the
division

1Canucks vs 4Jets                        Canucks in 5

  Comment  Its more like Vancouver vs Selanne  King and Domi for
            enforcing help Winnipeg out a little maybe a game  Canucks
            have their number

Except that the Canuck are playing like shit Winnipeg can win this
one though I think Vancouver will manage to slip by

So are the Islanders but they can still pull it out  Vancouver has Winnipegs
 number so it really doesnt matter

2Flames vs 3Kings                        Flames in 7

  Comment  7 games looks good as the Kings always seem to battle it out
            Flames are back in running and wont know memories of last years
            season  Gretzky is on a tear but there are too many 
            surrounding the Kings

Kings always seem to battle it out When Where

 Kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7 they never play a four or five
game serious  Theres a difference between battling it out and pulling it
out as I take Calgary to pull it out in 7
