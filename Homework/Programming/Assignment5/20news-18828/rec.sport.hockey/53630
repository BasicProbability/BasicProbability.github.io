or Boston You know Sindens going to find some way of screwing up 
even this good Boston team Hell fire Suter or trade away a vital 
star Admittedly his last few trades have been good ones but how 
long before his luck runs out and he starts making Espositofor
Ratelle type trades again 


How was this trade bad I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre  right wing combination and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else After the trade the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semifinal all of which of course they 
lost to Montreal which should please you to no end I doubt however keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series as he did not for
the Rangers in 79 or any of his years in Boston for that matter
