	NEW YORK UPI  Mike Keenan whose NHL coaching history
has been to wear out his welcome despite an impressive penchant for 
winning has come to the city that embraces victors above all else

Well I could become a fan  

Seriously this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the
Islanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
everywhere that Ive sampled  in fact the playoffs almost dont
exist now  Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York Ones
midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near
orgasm over Keenans hiring  Summarizing Keenan is a winner and
will give the Broadway Bums da business in pursuing the next Cup
chase 

	The Chicago Blackhawks cut their last tie with Keenan when
he was forced out as general manager in November He had given up
Chicagos coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power
of a GM now increases the pressure on beleaguered Rangers GM Neil
Smith

This will be an interesting combination to watch  Keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely  A lot of big
player moves will happen  remember that Keenan got rid of Denis
Savard  The country club days are over 

	When Keenan left Chicago I couldnt help but think about 
him as our coach Smith said There was an indication he would 
be taken off the market I feared that and couldnt let that happen

If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered
Keenan the big money to putupandshutup back in January the
Rangers might not be heading for golf now 

	Keenan 43 takes on a demoralized team that offers him a
chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects  at the
highest salary ever commanded by an NHL coach The Rangers  owned
by Gulf  Western  have bestowed upon Keenan an unprecedented 3
million fouryear deal

	Ive known Mike a long time Messier said Weve won two
Canada Cups together Hes been to the finals three times Maybe we
miss just one more element to win the Stanley Cup I dont think hes
the same person he was 10 years ago or even five years ago I think he
has changed and bettered himself with experience

One of Keenans first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier
will be the teams captain

	The timing of the move gives the Rangers new coach 2 12
months to prepare for the NHL draft June 26 and Neil Smith may 
not back off the their tradehappy pattern

By then Smith might have some bargains on Keenans advice  like
maybe unloading Phil Bourque for Tie Domi
