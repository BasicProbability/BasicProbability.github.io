Picture if you will the Habs going into the last couple minutes of the
game leading 20  The Nords get a power play pull Hextall and get
a goal  Bout a minute later they get another one  Then they win in
overtime

A bad dream

Hows that Red Hot Chili Peppers song go
Give it awaygive it away give it away now

Oh well  Suppose I can always watch the Leafs win tomorrow night
   smilies

Am I the only female hockey fan in the world
