Subject Nords 3  Habs 2 in OT We was robbed

Aargh

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques
The Nords penalty came in OT  Stewart being an exNordique himself
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murderWE WAS ROBBED

It was an excellent game with plenty of endtoend rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau
was serving a penalty  I dont mind Stewart calling a penalty in the
last 5 min of the game but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT  The Nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once  Stewart turned
the other cheekBASTARD

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night  The winning goal shouldnt have
gone in

Dont get me wrong Im not blaming the loss on Stewart  The Habs had
plenty of chances to capitalize Muller LeClair Haller etc but
failed to put the puck in the net  Thats what did them in  But
Mr Stewart didnt help matters at all

Oh well at least the Bruins lost in OT also Ha Ha
