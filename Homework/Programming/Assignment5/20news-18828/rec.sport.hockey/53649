A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight as the Minnesota North Stars 
or Norms Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of
53  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen who netted
two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to
play

Are there any further stories to report on the eve of Norms farewell 
from the twin cities In an earlier post it was announced that Norm 
Green was given until midnight of the last homegame of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena 
Did this happen Was Norm runoutoftown

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board 
the scoreboard fell to the ice and flattened Mr Greedy to a large
piece of green paper Arena management had to use the Zamboni which 
they confiscated from Norms truck to cleanup the useless remains
