I cant understand how someone in the sports dept cant even recognise
the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works for

You think thats bad  one year we had all three New York teams in
the playoffs and the cableco operator SCNY once shared a channel with
BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM didnt know what I
was talking about 

While its nice that the NHL is back on American network TV it faces
the same problems as it did with the All Star game  Local preemptions
and zero promotion okay I dont watch that much TV so Im just foaming
all right  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable
before going to the networks  In year one of the new ESPN contract the
saturation coverage of SCA all other games shown to completion like
the QuebecMontreal and SabresBruins overtimes is missed around here
