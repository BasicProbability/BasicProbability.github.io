Subject Flames Truly Brutal in Loss

As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon
dropping a 63 decision to the LA Kings Most of the Flames neglected
to show up especially in their own zone as the Kings hit at least
five posts The Flames best line was probably
SkrudlandPaslawskiBerube which tells how bad the Flames were Gary
Suter scored a great goal in fact all three Flame goals were scored
by Dmen  Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others but also made
some bonehead plays For the Kings Pat Conacher was especially
impressive 

The games was VERY chippy as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and
never recovered it there were highsticks crosschecks punches
hits from behind Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren
Rychel from behind Flames dominated the game physically but failed
to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses I dont think
Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals Calgary went with 7 Dmen
as Roger Johansson played LW he looked lost IMHO  I hope King
inserts Chris Lindbergh Paul Kruse or Sergei Makarov for Wednesdays
game Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charleyhorse no
idea how serious  he didnt return

I still think the Flames should win this series but they better
buckle down
