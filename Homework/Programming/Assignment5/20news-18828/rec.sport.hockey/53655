I hear Daigle will eb the first pick next year What is the word on Kariya
Anybody ever seen him play on TV Is he also entering the draft

People are seeming to be less concerned about Kariyas size as he leads
teams to championships World Junior and US College and collects
awardseveryone is watching with interest as to how he will perform
on left wing with Eric Lindros and Mark Recchi at the world
championships

4 months of gochances were not very good that he would go in the
top fivenow it has become probablea great world championship
could put him in the top 3 with Daigle and Pronger
