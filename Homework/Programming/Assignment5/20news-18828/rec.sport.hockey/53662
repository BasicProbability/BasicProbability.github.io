 The Hawks win  Jermey Roenick scored his 50 th goal and the Hawks put the
 Leafs in their place the losers column  If the Leafs can not even beat the
 Hawks in a match that had little or no meaning I will hate to see them against
 the Wings  
 
 Oh btw I laugh at rm that jerky
 
 GO HAWKS
 
 JB

But I gotta tell ya

If the Hawks cant beat the Blues in a game that
IS significant I cant wait to see how the Blues
might do against Toronto 

BTW if you think that the Hawks deserved to win that game
I think you were not watching the same one everyone else
was
