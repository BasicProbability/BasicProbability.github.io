 DEG has many germanborn forwards in the team In fact the majority of players
 are germanborn 199293 DEG had 11150 average in 11800 spectator arena

Interesting One of our German friends here Robert told me their forwards
were all CanadianGermans Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us
 
 My PossibleNHLEuropean leaguesite list
 Switzerland   Berne Zurich Lugano and 12 others

OK this aint North America and so on but I still doubt that any city
having a pop of 500000 and below could support an NHL team Of course
Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small
distances between cities but still 

 Germany       Dusseldorf Cologne Berlin Munich Mannheim Rosenheim

Dusseldorf YES although the arena is an anachronism an OPEN wall behind one
of the goals  essentially an outdoor arena Colognes arena only seats about
70008000 Berlin is about 6000 and no new facility will be built
unless their Olympic bid is successful Munich does have an arena 

 Sweden        Stockholm Gothenburg Malmo Gavle

Malmo is big enough but they also need a new arenathe current one has 
5000 seats I think

 Finland       Helsinki Turku Tampere

If were talking about the NHL even Helsinki would struggle to make it work
Turku despite an excellent arena and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for
major league hockey

 Italy         Milan

Rome and the south are out of the question this could as well be Africa
to hockey fans Romans were given the chance to host some WC94 games but
showed no interest whatsoever All teams in the Italian league come from Milan
and the smaller cities in the north

 France        Paris Chamonix Ruoen

Paris had their own Volans Francaissp pro team a couple of years ago
I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals 
tournament one year but eventually folded due to lowerthanhopedfor 
attendances The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor 
sport like hockey

 Norway        Oslo
 Austria       Vienna Villach
 Chech         Prag
 Slovakia      Bratislava
 Russia        Moscow St Petersburg

The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey

 Great Britain 

Perhaps    Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning
anyway playing in a small 10000 seat arena backed by Japanese money run by 
enthusiasts Phil Esposito heavy
marketing fans that have difficulty telling what icing means London has
been mentioned Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new
megafacility 16000 seats might be built in Bristol in a couple of years

 Netherlands   

No facilities to speak of their biggest arena in Eindhoven seats 2500 
fans for hockey
