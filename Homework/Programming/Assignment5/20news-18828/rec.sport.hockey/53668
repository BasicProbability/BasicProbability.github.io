Subject Re Playoff predictions

Here are my predictions try not to laugh hysterically
Somebody save this so I can laugh when I win my own pool
I dont have prizes but we all love BRAGGING RIGHTS so winner takes them

Also  If somebody has some sort of scoring system let me know
I was thinking 1 for 1st round victories 2 for second 3 for 3rd 4 for 4th
But we may get alot of ties  Any ideas
