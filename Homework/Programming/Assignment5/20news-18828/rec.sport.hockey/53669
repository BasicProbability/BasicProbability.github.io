 ATLANTIC DIVISION
 	
 	ST JOHNS MAPLE LEAFS VS MONCTON HAWKS
 	MONCTON HAWKS
 See CD Islanders Moncton is a very similar team to CDI Low scoring
 defensive good goaltending John Leblanc and Stu Barnes are the only
 noticable guns on the team But the defense is top notch and 
 Mike ONeill is the most underrated goalie in the league
 

 Bri as I have tried to tell you since 2 February Michael ONeill
 might be the most underrated goalie in the AHL but he ISNT in the
 AHL  Hes on the Winnipeg Jets injury list as he has been since
 his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators  Hes out until
 next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation

 Stu Barnes might be an AHL gun for the Hawks but hes now the third
 line center with the Jets and has been since mid January or so

Sorry my memory is gone I thought that ONeill got sent back
down in February but I must have been given incorrect info I guess
this says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of
their top 3 or so scorers even though hes been out since January
