 Well I was a little off in those predictions  One I didnt count on the
 Devils scoring 6 goals tonight in a 66 tie hence there goes the streak
 
 Secondly I didnt count on the Islanders getting just 1 point out of 4
 against the Whalers in two games  So no more IslesCapitals
 
 New predicitons 
 
 1PENGUINS VS 4ISLANDERS                  Penguins in 6 or 7
 
 
 2CAPITALS VS 3DEVILS                     Devils in 7
 
Why should we pay your predictions any heed considering
you couldnt even predict the proper matchups  Maybe
you should try forecasting the weather instead
