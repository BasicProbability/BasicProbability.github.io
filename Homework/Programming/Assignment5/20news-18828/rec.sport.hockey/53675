Subject European expansion and our fcked system

Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking
wishful thoughts but being totally off the ball

The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe
for those that dont know the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted

Would European fans put up with our if youve paid you can play 
attitude

How long would they support teams that are run on Rangerbased 
corporate thinking I use the term lightly  We dont need a good
product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawas
record every year1940 haha sorry had ta say it

If hockey and other pro sports had a similar system to Europe maybe
teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete or get demoted the fourth 
division  Wed have many more teamscentres that arent as big like
Halifax or Adirondackok so Halifax isnt a good example would 
eventually get promoted and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division unlike Ottawa SJ Edmonton etc Fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty or penalized for their neglect and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley CupI can
dream cant I

Look at British or any European soccer as an example they never have fan
problems

Just someone who thinks our system really sucks
