7   Carol Alt Head Coach In 9394

I wish  She can be my head coach any time  Sorry Ali  Back to
real hockey

Hmmmmmm I think Ill let everyone make there own comment on this one


THE BAD
 
Alexei Kovalev
What did the Rangers think when they signed him Did they think he
was another Domi  Just let him play And not on a 4th line  Better
that he stays in the minors and gets icetime ALL the time

Whose bad  It has been Neilson and Smiths decision to play him there
if thats what you mean then thats bad  But Kovalev himself is a very
good player  Youre right if he werent stranded on the fourth line
maybe hed produce  Sound familiar  Darren Turcotte

Neilson and Smith are bad Kovalev is magical
