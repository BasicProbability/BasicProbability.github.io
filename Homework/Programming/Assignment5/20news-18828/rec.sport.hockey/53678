 So Roussel was giving up almost another goal a game while facing a proportional
 number of shots for the number of minutes he played and while I havet
 actually checked I believe that he faced a lower quality of opponent
 
 Make that less than half a goal a game  The lower quality of opponet
 argument is immaterial as neither Roussel nor Soderstrom had any say in
 the matter  That was Dineens decision

So in other words if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
the Penguins thats immaterial because it was the coaches decision Come on
Joe think about what youre saying Who they played is VERY significant
Why they played them is whats irrelevent A low GAA against good teams
is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders A low GAA is better then a higher GAA A low GAA against good
teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders

  The fact of the matter is that despite last nights shutout he doesnt
  have what it takes Last night was due to an inept Ranger team much more
  than Roussels skill A 3 on 1 and they dont get a shot away A 2 on none
  and one guy just passes and stops the other guy shoots into Roussels pad
 
 Cmon Pete  So the Rangers were inept  A shutout is a shutout  During
 both of Soderstroms masterpieces against Toronto Mike Emerich was quoted
 as saying he didnt think the Leafs had much offensive firepower past their
 first line  Does that make Soderstroms shutouts less impressive because of
 Torontos lack of offense

YES IT DOES Absolutely In the context of comparing two goaltenders
Of course at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you
get them And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts But if youre a
coach deciding between two goalies or a GM looking to make a trade you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets I didnt see the second Toronto
game but the first one was a defensive masterpiece There was nothing in
that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasnt tested The same
for Roussel in the Ranger game Two real scoring chances one he made a
great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player If
you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by

But if you were to look at the 00 tie against the Habs you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout THAT was a 1 goalie in action Roussel
doesnt have a game like that in him

 Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the 1 goalie Soderstrom
 was being treated for his heart ailment  The Flyers finished November at
 631 and were 9104 overall  And theres no way of knowing where the Flyers
 would have finished if Soderstom wasnt wearing the oragne n black  Im glad
 we dont have to find out anytime soon either because he is one hell of a
 player  I would take him over Roussel right now but I still think Dom has
 what it takes to be the 1 guy  He outperformed Hextall enough during the
 9192 season to make Flyers management think that way too

Dont be so sure of that FLYERS management never says bad thing about
Roussel but they dont say too much on the good side either Ive seen
at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders it was Tommy this Tommy that and oh yeah
Dom has played well too

 By the way what was the final card on Monday night  Team picture by any
 chance

FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame Kinda dull really They handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in midseason Had names like Benning
Kasper

 And how did the Flyers choose the fans who received the shirts off our
 backs  Winning Recchis jersey after breaking the clubs single season
 point record would have been nice  But knowing your luck you would have
 won Roussels

Mostly random seat locations some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos I dont like that method since Ive seen
guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture theyd hold em for their buddies
