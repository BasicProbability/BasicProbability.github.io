 Chelios the Norris

If you asked me 30 days ago Id agree with you  I now give the nod to
Raymond Bourque his play took off the same time the Bs did  Chelios
gets a close second

How about Kevin Hatcher Scored roughly 35 goals plays 30 minutes a game

 dunno who wins the Vezina but I suspect not Potvin  
  
Barrasso finally gets his due in a close one over Eddie the Eagle

Thats really sad when two secondrate goalies Barasso and Belfour
are the main contenders for the Vezina Call me crazy but how about
Tommy Soderstrom  five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesnt
really play defense Its really unfortunate that the better goalies
in the league McLean Essensa Vernon had unspectacular years BTW
if you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days
why not give the Vezina to Moog He has been the best goalie over the
past month

 Coach of the year is tricky  Burns did the most with the least raw talent
 King did a good job but the Flames clearly underachieved last year Brian
 Sutter has done exceptionally well in his first year with a new team ditto
 Demers Page has been blessed by the ripening and acquisition of young
 talent Darryl Sutter is having a good year for a rookie coach Berry made
 the best of a bad situation Terry Crisp worked minor miracles and Bowman
 was Bowman  Id pick Burns but Im mildly biased

In your case that bias is acceptable  Mine shows with the Norris pick
so were even

Im impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did but my pick would be 
Al Arbour  Not too many folks thought the Isles would be in the playoffs let 
alone contend for 3rd in their division Granted that they did have a little
help from their cousins on Broadway 

And I like the Islanders about as much as I like mowing my lawn

Arbour or King Burns will probably win since playoffs arent taken
into consideration  hes OK in the regular season but Im not sure
if hes beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs
