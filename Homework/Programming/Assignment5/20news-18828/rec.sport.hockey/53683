 Bad news for the Patrick division next year  Caps GM David Polie is
 reportedly trying to get a front office job with the NHL  I cant
 believe Polie has not been fired despite 10 years of mediocrity
 

	You know what Frank Its not David Poiles fault that the Caps
have mired in mediocrity for so long Blame it on the owner Abe Polin
This guy owns both the NBAs Bullets and the NHLs Capitals How dumb
and selfish could this guy be Hes unwilling to spend the bucks in 
order to get a big star to Landoverno wonder both teams STINK

	Ive heard that the Capitals had a chance to get Detroits
Steve Yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute Why
Because our good man Abe is afraid to spend the cash

	Nevertheless Im still faithful and hoping that one day
this devilish dictator will be replaced
