Now if we could just clone Chelioss personality and transplant it
into all of the defensemen on the Islanders Capitals and Devils

In other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they
will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of
misconducts
 
And this comes from a Chelios fan
 
 Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35
 minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
 best defenseman in the league Id take a whole team of Chelioses if I
 could That way when one got a penalty the others could kill it
