 Because of the Moncton win Friday night Halifax was eliminated thus St
 Johns will make Halifax home The first round of playoffs wil take place
 on these dates
 
 	April 14  Halifax Metro Center Leafs Home Game
         April 17  Halifax Metro Center
      
 	April 21  Moncton
 	April 23  Moncton
 
 	April 26  Halifax Metro Center
 
 	April 30  Moncton
 
This is a Halifax or at least this Halifax residents dream come true
The leafs are my favorite NHL team and no I dont know why
Id say that this is even better than the Citadels making the playoffs a
Quebec farm team who cares

By the way for any NFLD fansIm sure ASN will carry some of the games
theyd be stupid not tobut then this is ASN
I havent heard any news about ASN carrying any games but the local
cable station here in St Johns Cable 9 is carrying the games live

Hey its better than nothing

GO LEAFS GO
