My vote goes to John Vanbiesbrouck  His mask has a skyline of New York
City and on the sides there are a bunch of bees Beezer  It looks
really sharp

Doesnt it also have the Statue of Liberty on it or is that Richters Mask

The back actually has a Bee followed by a Z to represent the Beezer It 
also has something that looks like the three interconnecting circles from
the Led Zepplin 4 album cover Is that what it is supposed to be and if
it is does anybody know why he would put it there Ali
