 Actually Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two
 spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers It is Mats Sundin and
 Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team although in a late
 stage of the tournament Technically I seem to recall that you can leave
 spots open until 24 hrs before the WC final

HmmmI also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and
leave a spot open for at least one NHLer Some guy named Selnne ever
hear of him   They might have to be content with Kurri though I hope
