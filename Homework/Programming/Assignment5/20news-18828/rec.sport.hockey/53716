HmmmI also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and
leave a spot open for at least one NHLer Some guy named Selnne ever
hear of him   They might have to be content with Kurri though I hope 

True coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way
until the medal games He wants Teppo Numminen too And Kurri but for
them the spots cannot be left open for too long Esa Tikkanen we have
already 

Even without these players I think we have pretty good team Young
hungry talented guys no old players that have got everything except
the gold Yesterdays practise game SWEFIN 66 shows that the two
worlds best hockey teams  are in prime shape  The Finn line
Riihijarvislightly injuredSaarikoskiViitakoski shined I bet these
two teams are the best in the NHL too Roger Roger

What do you people think about Team Canada with Lindros BrindAmour
Burke Ranford Recchi Dineen Can they beat the Finns
