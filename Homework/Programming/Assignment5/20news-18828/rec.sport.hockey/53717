  DEG has many germanborn forwards in the team In fact the majority of players
  are germanborn 199293 DEG had 11150 average in 11800 spectator arena
 
 Interesting One of our German friends here Robert told me their forwards
 were all CanadianGermans Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us

As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one CanadianGerman forward ie a  player
who was born in Canada but now has a German passport 
Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play 
for Germany in the WC

The other Canadaborn forwards are
	PeterJohn Lee has British passport
	Chris Valentine
	Dale Dercatch
	Steve Gootas
 	Earl Spry 

At the moment there are only three Germanborn forwards coming into my mind
	Bernd Trunschka Andreas Brockmann Ernst Koepf
