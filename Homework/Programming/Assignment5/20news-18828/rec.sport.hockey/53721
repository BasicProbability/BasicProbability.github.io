 Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish
 blue line Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and
 shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterers top corner Ville Sirens slap
 shot from the blue line on power play made it 11 and Juha Riihijarvi
 scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal
 put the puck high over Aslin 12 after the first period
 The Finns started the second period with really good pressure Korpisalo
 made it 13 with another goal from close range high over Aslin Then
 during the Finnish pressure Sweden turned the game around in 147
 Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal and passed the puck to
 Jan Larsson in front who backhanded the puck low 23 Rundqvist entered
 the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund and the Finnish defense let Ahlund 
 skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal 33
 Next Roger Hansson behind the goal sent the puck back to the blue line
 where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didnt see the puck since
 there was traffic in front 43
 Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan the Shadow Nilsson Stefan
 and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone Patrik passed the puck back to
 Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake 53
 Then Keijo Sailynoja show started He reduce and equalized the lead in only
 21 seconds First he scored the 54 goal and after that he came in alone 
 with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot Sailynoja
 made a nice penalty shot showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot
 The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 65 goal
 late in the game on a nice power play combination Renberg waited in the slot
 showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side Ahlund passed the puck
 and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterers goals far side
 But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the
 games final goal to make it 66 Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow
 angle that maybe Aslin should have saved

 All in all a decent game where the defense wasnt the best
 Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period
 to try no combinations

 Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team Larsson
 NilssonJuhlin best line overall again it seems to be a working WC line
 Stillman good on defense
 Some players arent good enough for the WC though Hakan Ahlund faell ner
 hjaelmen och jobba Roger Hansson Challe Berglund Kenny Jonsson
 will likely have to leave for NHL pros

 Twogoal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the
 Finnish team Markus Ketterer didnt have a very good game weve seen him
 a lot better so Lindfors is probably Finlands starting goalie in the WC
 I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team It would be inter
 resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC
