    Now what if the two teams were merged this has been proposed in Tampere 
 with Ilves  Lynx and Tappara  Axe  The fans wouldnt take it 
 They rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even 
 relegated than merged  Its not that difficult to understand its just 
 like here in Helsinki  You grow up being either a Jokerit or HIFK fan
 The other team is the last team in the world you would support  Im not 
 talking about hate but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry

Deeply rooted rivalry Ahem Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined
the top flight only in the early 70s Helsingfors IFK have been around since
1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think
youre exagerating here

    However its been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team
  thats the Finnish national team  Maybe thats how you could set up a 
 huge franchise in Finland  No one has ever said that the team must be 
 called after one city or play all its games on one arena  Just one Team 
 Finland and Team Sweden in the NHL just wouldnt make any sense  we have 
 way more talent than 124th of the total of North American talent  After a 
 couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the 
 Nordic  presuming that our teams would have the advantage in  drafting 
 local talent as prooposed

Thats a rather bold claim in the light of how successful the Canadian 
American Olympic teams have been    and theyve had to play according to our
set of rules and on international ice The 1992 Olympic teams contained about
as much talent as your average expansion team Canada had Eric Lindros Sean
Burke Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos Another four or five have been deep subs in
the NHL As for the Yanks Keith Tkachuk Scott Lachance Bret Hedican Shawn 
McEachern Steve Heintze Ted Donato Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 
3rd4th line players in the NHL while Robb Stauber has done well for the 
Kings in goal Nothing more In fact Im sure that an AllStar team assembled
from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford 
or Tampa Bay currently are doing

But what happens if all topclass Finnish  Swedish players gradually end up
with Helsinki  Stockholm as the North Americanbased ones gradually retire and
no CanadianAmerican team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia 
Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHLbased players

This would be interesting Clearly Finlands top five players Winnipegs
Selanne  Numminen Vancouvers Lumme Los Angeles Jari Kurri and New Yorks
Tikkanen are right up there with any fiveman unit Pittsburgh  co have But
I have my doubts about the homebased Finnish players  the national team did
well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
Markus Ketterer the goalie 34 or the players listed above and luck Theres
presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldnt be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players however My guess would be
that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a 500 team in the NHL

Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America
Their points total 16 players is 274  seven more than Ottawas 22 top
players combined If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in 
Sweden an allSwedish team would assemble about 350360 skill points
Deducting some points from Pittsburgh NY Rangers and other teams that rely on
Swedish players the Swedish team would finish in sixth place  about as high
as Boston Vancouver Calgary and Montreal on paper So the dynasty talk
isnt completely unfounded here An allFinnishallSwedish team might have an
advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time
wont have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language and presumably
play the wideopen European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the
North American checking game However if free agency becomes a factor the top 
Scandinavian players still might end up playing for largemarket teams after a 
couple of years the same way Edmontons dynasty crumbled in the late 80s 
Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an 
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all Id settle for a 
compromise prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during 
the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players After this 
the amateur draft should be open to anyone
