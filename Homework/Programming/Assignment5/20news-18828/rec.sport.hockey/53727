Not too low perhaps but surely not as high as that of an European NHL
division The Finnish team for example would contain all players currently 
 on
the national team plus a topclass foreigner or two They would be in an
entirely different league than TPS or Jokerit both of whom have perhaps a
dozen players of international class  if even that Why settle for a minor
league when you could have the best

How many players of international class an average NHL team has 610
Top players just play more in smaller rinks Is the quality of European hockey
really poor then recent years only few northamerican usually good farm 
players players have got place in Finnish league or Elitserien while most 
have been shipped back
