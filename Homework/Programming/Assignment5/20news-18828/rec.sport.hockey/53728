 	I do not have cable and on the nights the Caps dont play I
 would like to tune in other games  Does anyone have a list of
 the radio stations which broadcast the games for the NHL teams
 
 
 			Thanks in advance
 
 I can give you a couple  In Detroit WJR 760 will be broadcasting
 at least the first couple of games of the WingsToronto series and 
 since they broadcast at 50000 Watts you may be able to pick it up
 after dark where you are at  The Pittsburgh Penguins games used to be
 broadcast on KDKA 1020 but I dont know whether they will be preempted
 by baseball and moved to another station or not  You can try those
 if the local baseball teams arent playing at the same time anyway

KDKA has first rights to Pirates games and will split probably 5050
in conflicts for Penguins games which are preempted check out 
1025 WDVE FM thats right DVE  It is also 50000 watts
