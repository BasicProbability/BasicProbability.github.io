Subject New Franchise name

The new name is Florida Panthers  
The panther is an endangered species mostly located in the Everglades
A couple of years ago there were license plates made with Panthers on
them part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund

The name of the new President of the Panthers should be announced today

As of yesterdays paper Huizengas new hockey team will take the ice at
the Miami Arena this fall  The team has a guaranteed twoyear lease with
the arena with four oneyear options that could run through 1999

Its not our choice James Blosser a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said
about ruling out the arena as a long term option  The NHL told us we 
cant stay there  Its not economically feasible

One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox
and advertising revenue at the arena reducing the hockey teams profit
potential

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward Dade 
and Palm Beach counties

A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium where residents
10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena ending
an eightyear battle of wills
