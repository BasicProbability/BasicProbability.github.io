Subject Panthers President

As I promised I would give you the name of the Panthers president
After Huizenga announced the team name he announced that Bill
Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers

A little Bio from SunSentinel
Torrey the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders
Throughout his 27 years in the NHL Bill Torreys bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassis hair

The Panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticketprice 
information in early next month  In the meantime Huizenga leaves the
daytoday operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke the VP and
GM

The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Floridas NHL team
to focus attention on an endangered species  There are 30 to 50 Florida
Panthers in the Everglades National Park the Big Cypress National 
Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida

The Panther is the quickeststriking of all cats Torrey said  
Hopefully thats the way well play on ice

More BIO
In Torrey Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders
in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four
consecutive Stanley Cup championships their first after only eight
seasons and 14 consecutive winning seasons  As executive vice president
of the California Golden Seals Torrey watched the Seals go to the play
offs in 1968 only their second NHL season

I guess this completes my own personal hat trick said Torrey 58 a
native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm
Beach
