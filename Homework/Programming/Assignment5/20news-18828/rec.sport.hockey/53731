I can give you a couple  In Detroit WJR 760 will be broadcasting
at least the first couple of games of the WingsToronto series and 
since they broadcast at 50000 Watts you may be able to pick it up
after dark where you are at  The Pittsburgh Penguins games used to be
broadcast on KDKA 1020 but I dont know whether they will be preempted
by baseball and moved to another station or not  You can try those
if the local baseball teams arent playing at the same time anyway

According to this mornings PostGazette

The Pens will be carried by KDKARadio1020 am unless the Pirates
are playing  When the Pirates play the games will be carried by 
WDVE1025 fm  WDVE will carry 12 games starting with tonights
game

In fact after this season KDKA will no longer be the flagship
station for the Pens  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new 
deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games  It seems
more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next 
season  KBL will carry 62 games on tv  with 17 of the games to be 
simulcast on KDKATV  The remaining 22 games as well as some of the 
early round playoff games will be available by subscription tv only
To receive the games youll have to pay a one time hook up fee and
then a monthly fee of 1112 dollars

Also under the new deal there will no longer be radiotv 
simulcasts  There will be a TV broadcast team and a radio
broadcast team  

No word on who the announcers will be  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald
are both under contract with KDKA but their contracts expire at the
end of this season  KBL President Bill Craig said hed like to hire
Lange and Steigerwald
