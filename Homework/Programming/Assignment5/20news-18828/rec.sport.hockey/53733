  And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
  resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other 
  team captain trivia would be appreciated
 
  Wasnt Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
  Pittsburgh
 
   And Rick Tochett was the captain of the Flyers when traded to the Pens
 recently
 

And of course Mike Ramsey was at one time the captain in Buffalo prior to
being traded to Pittsburgh  Currently the Penguins have 3 former captains
and 1 real captain Lemieux playing for them  They rotate the As during the
season and even the C while Mario was out  Even Troy Loney has worn the C
for the Pens
