 	According to THE FAN here in TO Ottawa has won the Daigle e
 sweepstakes  They didnt mention why but San Jose had more goals
 than the Sensens so I have a hunch this is why Ottawa would pick
 first

If Im not mistaken San Jose had more wins than Ottawa First tiebreaker in
the NHL is always most wins
