 Wasnt Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
 Pittsburgh

No

In what still IMHO ranks as the alltime greatest PR blunder not to
mention onice blunder the Whalers ever committed GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley decided that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captains C in December of 1990 The whole organization read
EJ and Ley and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blindsided by EJ dumped on Francis all
season starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract publicly 
humiliating him stripping him of the C and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins Classy guy that EJ

The loss of Francis and too a lesser extent Ulf was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fanawareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today

Gratuitous good EJ notehe did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek Cassels Sanderson Poulin Nylander etc He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation

SG a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder
