 After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
 Milwaukee should have an NHL team I thought Id pass along a story I heard
 recently  This is second hand so I dont know how true it is but I have
 no reason to doubt it either
 
 Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
 hockey team  The owner of the Admirals sorry I cant remember his name
 either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
 Bradley Center

Lloyd Pettit

 
 Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but 
 turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 50 million was too
 high
 
 Like I said I dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
 its true dont look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon  The Admirals
 arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an NHL club
 and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBAs
 Milwaukee Bucks play there as well

Yes it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for 50M but
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
less than that He felt that no one would pay 50M for an expansion team and
that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that But
the market fooled him and 5 teams have been created for 50M apiece in the
last three years and even the existing teams cant be moved for less than 
50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little

Pettit gambled and lost Now hell have to pay more
