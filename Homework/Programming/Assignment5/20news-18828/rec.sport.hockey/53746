 	Are people here stupid or what It is a tie breaker of cause they
 have to have the same record How can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as
 first in the list for tie breaker If it is a tie breaker how can there be
 different record Man I thought people in this net are good with hockey
 I might not be great in Math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same
 points with different record Manretard Cant believe people
 actually put win as first in a tie breaker

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me that you dont actually ATTEND Rensselaer and
that you just work for ITS Or that this was toungeincheek
