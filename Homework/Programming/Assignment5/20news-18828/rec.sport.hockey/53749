Detroit April 19

In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers the Detroit Redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a 63 win over the best team in the NHL the Toronto Maple Leafs 

Not only that but if Im not mistaken Detroit scored 4 goals on their first
five shots on netlooks like Torontos cream cheese run continues or is
that swiss cheese after watching Potvin Im leaning towards the latter
