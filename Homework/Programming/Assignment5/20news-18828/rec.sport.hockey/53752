The San Francisco Bay area media is reporting tonight that the Detroit
Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 63  Can someone who is not
part of the media conspiracy against the Leafs tell me how the game
really went I am expecting a 40 win for the Leafs shutout for
Potvin hat trick for Andreychuk and a goal and 3 assists for
Gilmour  If the Leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever
biased ref was at the game have to call against the Leafs to let the
Red Wings win

Thank you very much

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victoryeasily

I watched most of the game on ESPN as soon as I realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second
The Maple Leafs were flat  Very flat  Meanwhile the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game  I didnt
detect any bad penalty calls Van Hellemond did his usual good job
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years  nervous

For the Leafs sake I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
for game 2  If game 1 is indicative of the series its gonna go
quick
