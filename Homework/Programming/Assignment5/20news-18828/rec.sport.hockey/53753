Does anyone have the games ESPN will be airing this week  Hopefully the
DetroitToronto game tongiht  I though ABC did a decent job by getting some

Fking NO hockey games televised nationally tonight  What the hell is
this  Why the hell is ESPN showing some stupid baseball game when
baseball is not even three weeks into the season and hockey is in the
playoffs  No wait I know the answer   But still  It really
pisses me off to no end  They better start putting some more fcking
games on or they will never make any money off of the deal that brought
hockey back to ESPN  AARGH  not that Id watch anyway but hockey
needs all the publicity it can get

You obviously dont understand how TV scheduling works  ESPN had
prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had
contracted all the other bs shows well in advance  The NHL TV deal
was very late in the scheduling process you normally have to do this
oneplus year out  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the
season started  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by
squeezing in extra telecasts when it could like the last Minnesota
game and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball
telecasts which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last
night

But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will  They
must honor the previous deals they made   does have something
to do with it especially if you risk a  lawsuit for breach of
contract with baseball

So relax  Im happy  I dont get SportsChannel anyway
