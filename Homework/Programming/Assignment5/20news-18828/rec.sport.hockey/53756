The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary against
the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 63 victory in front of
a nonsellout crowd of 18605 at the Saddledome in Calgary

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the
opening period though the Kings scored off the opening faceoff  The Kings got
into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out
standing team defense  It took the Flames 945 of the first period to record
their first shot on goal  The Kings ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on
penalty killing shut down the Flames  The Flames went 08 on the power play 
and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities  The Kings had
their problems on the power play yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10
tries

The Kings forwards backchecked while the defense stood the Flames up at the
blue line allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the 
Flames  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex
pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse
in his right leg  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to 
the dressing room for the rest of the game  Interviewed on the radio this 
morning he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday

1st period 
10 The Kings got things started right off the opening faceoff  Gretzky won
the draw with the puck going to Sydor  He crossed center ice and slapped the
puck into the Flames zone and behind the net  The puck carried around to the
far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom He
put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up  Gretzky set up
in his office moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where
Sydor had moved in  Sydor who got the puck between the faceoff dot and the 
hash mark shot off the pass beating Vernon low and between the legs

Millen and Fleury went off at 457  Skrudland went off at 1225 but the Kings
failed to convert  Carson went off at 1453 and the Flames failed to convert
Dahlquist went off at 1834 and Dahl went off at 1930 giving the Kings a 30
second 5on3 which they failed to convert  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in
the period

2nd period 
The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed
to convert on  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4 Vernon put a bouncing puck into
the stands and received a delay of game

11 Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play  Kurri with the
puck in the neutral zone tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit 
the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line  Suter skated 
down the near wing and into the Kings zone  He faked a shot at the circle and
skated around Kurri As he cut thorugh the crease he got Hrudey to go with him 
and he put the puck behind Hrudey on his stick side for a short hander

21 The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play
Shuchuk in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed
for the net  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot 
where 2 Kings Shuchuk and Granato were being checked by 3 Flames  Carson
came from the far corner picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot
between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease

31 The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later  Rychel was checked off
the puck at the Flames blue line  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass
cross the slot to Huddy  Huddy shot off the pass from the near faceoff dot
beating a diving Vernon on the glove side

41 259 later the Kings had a 3 goal lead  McSorley took a shot form the
near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards  Marty got his
own rebound skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low
slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon

Skrudland went off at 1053 but the Kings could not convert  Sydor went off at
1235 and Watters went off at 1440 giving the Flames a 5 second 53 but they
failed to convert  McSorley went off at 1719 and the Flames had 3 consecutive
power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high
sticking at 1731  Sandstrom went off at 1803 to close out the period  The
Kings hit 3 goal post in the period

3rd period
The Kings used the phrase Initiate not retaliate and it was very evident here
in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames 
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game

51 The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 106 mark  The Kings shot
the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone  Vernon went behind the net to
cut off the puck but he could not control it  Donnelly who was behind him
wacked at the puck sending it into the low slot  As Vernon slid back in to the
crease Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net
where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon

Sydor went off at 124 Nieuwendyk went off at 322 as the teams skated 4 on 4

52 Otto skating down the far side stepped around McSorley cut to the net
and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot  Dahlquist cut through the top of the 
crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey

Carson and Rychel came in on a 21  When Carson passed across to Rychel Fleury
tripped Rychel with no call  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where 
Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards drawing 
a 5minute major and a game misconduct at the 608 mark  Unfortunately the 
Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato at 644 and Watters at 
819 took penalties  

53 The Flames closed to within 2 at the 847 mark  MacInnis at the near 
point passed to Yawney at the far point  He took a few strides towards the
net wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of
Hrudey  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost  Timeout  LA

63 MacInnis took a penalty at 956 and the Kings converted on the power play
to seal the victory  Sandstrom skating down the far wing in the Flames zone 
cut towards the back of the net  Just as he crossed the goal line he passed 
the puck into the low slot on the far side to Carson who shot off the pass 
beating Vernon on the ice stick side

At the 1617 mark Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he
went after Shuchuk  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing a single
minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct and he took the Flames
right out of the game

On the plus side  The Kings for the most part played very disciplined hockey
as they let Calgary retaliate  The Kings played good team defense and excellent
penalty killing

On the minus side  The Kings lost almost every faceoff  This must improve or
the Flames will surely get that power play back on track
