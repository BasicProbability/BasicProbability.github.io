are predicting  Although I think Bryan Murray is probably the best GM
I have ever seen in hockey
 
How do you figure that  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup  A good GM like Murray can

I think Murray has done a great job  Hes picked up Ciccarelli
Sheppard Ysebaert Howe Coffey and Riendeau plus some depth players 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects
All of this in three years  Has anyone done better

The year before he took over the Wings didnt even make the playoffs
There was about a year and a half during Demers stint that the Wings
did OK but that was due to Demers motavational skills and clutch
and grab style  They didnt have much talent

Gerald Murray wasnt responsible for Primeau although Im not
ready to admit thats a horrible pick  They hired him after the
draft which has never made sense to me  His first pick was
Lapointe

And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set
of things to worry about  Im getting bored reading the same problems
in the paper decade after decade  I want people to have to deal
with new problems
