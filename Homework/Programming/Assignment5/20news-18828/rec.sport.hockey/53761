I think that Jack Ferreiras firing eventually led to Kingstons
firing  You mention consistency of vision  I think the
Sharks lost that with the loss of Ferreira  There has never
been a 3 headed GM that has ever worked  You need one
person making the personnel decisions at the top not
management by committee  The conventional wisdom
from around the league is that Ferreira would have
made the moves that would have fielded a better product
on the ice

How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this  The threeheaded GMship has
taken a lot of heat but nobodys explained how things would have been any
different had Ferreira still been there  Would Ferreira have made more
trades  Who would have he had traded  Would he have made fewer trades
Who should not have been traded
