Next a clip was shown from an earlier episode in which Don was
proclaiming Doug Gilmour to be the best player not only in
the NHL but in the world What about players like Lemieux
Don said that Gilmour was the best PLAYER not Designated point getter
Its not like baseball where you have a designatted hitter who
can score runs but cant play defense Gilmour is a good two way player

This clip was shown on local news in Pittsburgh last night KDKA complete
with animated sarcasm by the sportscaster  Its the second time Cherry
has been shown on local Pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks  Both
times he was blasting Lemieux
