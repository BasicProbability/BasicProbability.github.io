Next a clip was shown from an earlier episode in which Don was
proclaiming Doug Gilmour to be the best player not only in
the NHL but in the world What about players like Lemieux
Don said that Gilmour was the best PLAYER not Designated point getter
Its not like baseball where you have a designatted hitter who
can score runs but cant play defense Gilmour is a good two way player

What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have
drafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux  

Perhaps once upon a time Don Cherry had some insight into the game of
hockey but hes really degenerated into a parody of himself
