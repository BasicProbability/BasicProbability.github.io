Well its not that bad But I am still pretty pissed of at the
local ABC coverage They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing

stuff deleted

Ok heres the solution to your problem  Move to Canada  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR gamesthe NJPITT at 100 on ABC LACAL at 300 CBC 
BUFFBOS at 700 TSN and FOX and MONQUE at 730 CBC  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40some odd
consecutive nights I havent counted so thats a pure guess

I have two tvs in my house and I set them up sidebyside to watch MONQUE
and keep an eye on BOSBUFF at the same time  I did the same for the two
afternoon games

Btw those ABC commentaters were great  I was quite impressed they seemed
to know that their audience wasnt likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job  They were quite impartial also IMO
