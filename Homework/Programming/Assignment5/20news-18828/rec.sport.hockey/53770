  It was nice to see ESPN show game 1 between the Wings and Leafs since
 the Cubs and Astros got rained out Instead of showing another baseball
 game they decided on the Stanley Cup Playoffs A classy move by ESPN
 
   It was good to see the Wings play but lets not give ESPN too much credit
There werent any other late baseball games on so they didnt have another
option

Go Pens
