 It was nice to see ESPN show game 1 between the Wings and Leafs since
the Cubs and Astros got rained out Instead of showing another baseball
game they decided on the Stanley Cup Playoffs A classy move by ESPN

They tried their best not to show it believe me Im surprised they
couldnt find a sprint car race mini cars through pigpens indeed
on short notice
