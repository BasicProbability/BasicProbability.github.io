Subject Re ABC coverage


In article 9454bluecispittedu ccohenpittedu Caleb N Cohen writes
   Boy  everyone has been ripping on ESPNs hockey coverage or is it just
Pittsburghers who are thrilled with Lange  Steigy  For all of you
who are unaware  ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all the 
production advertising sales commentating etc  and even 
reaped any  made

In the interests of saving badnwidth during this heated time of the
year viz the early flurry of retard comments coming from a certain
state whose name starts with P and ends with A why dont you tell us
something we dont already know
