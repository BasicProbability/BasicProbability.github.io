   Boy  everyone has been ripping on ESPNs hockey coverage or is it
just Pittsburghers who are thrilled with Lange  Steigy  For all of 
you who are unaware  ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all 
the production advertising sales commentating etc  and even 
reaped any  made

No Caleb its not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with
it is superb whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN
left off when hockey went to SC this is excepting SCs use of feeds
from CBC   Its the amount of hockey theyre showing or lack
of it that were complaining about  They had rights to two OTs
that couldve been shown on Sunday night after baseball  and
they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed
by Super8 home movies of old car races yes I was checking in
desperation for CanucksJets last night after SportsCenter
