I was skeptical before the game but was pleasantly surprised at the
coverage  I was particularly impressed by the close range camera coverage
of work in the corners and behind the play without losing a beat getting
back to the puck

Thorne is good and Ive always been a fan of Clement but I miss
Mike Emrick  My boyfriend who is not a hockey fan even looked up
at one point and said These guys are pretty good announcers  This
is the same guy who said that Rick Tocchet looks like Charles Bronson

I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the JerseyPitt series  Show
the shots not the hits  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot  They panned
back to show the rebound  Maybe Moms camera people were a little more 
experienced
