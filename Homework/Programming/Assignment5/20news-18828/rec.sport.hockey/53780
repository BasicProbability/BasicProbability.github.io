Subject Re Ron Francis

Not to mention Mr Francis is an incredibly nice person  Over Christmas
break a friend of mine had a little Xmas gathering  The two of us drove
to Rons house  While I stayed in the car out of shyness my friend went
to the door and rang the bell  Ron answered and my friend introduced
himself  He then proceeded to invite Francis to the party  Ron declined
because he had to watch his daughter  He then reached out and shook my
friends hand  I know this isnt rsb but I dont think Barry Bonds
would be this polite in this situation

George
