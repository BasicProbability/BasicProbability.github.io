Subject SHARKS REVIEW Part 2 Defensemen 219

I finally got it back with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending
it



2	ROB ZETTLER		Season	4th
Acquired	9192 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		CC

Zettler gave the Sharks every bit hes got this year unfortunately this still
wasnt enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer if that  He works
hard for sure but is no better than average on defense and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times while being basically an
offensive zero 0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games  He would be hardpressed
to make the team next year

3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season 2nd
Acquired	9192 free agent from New Jersey
Grade		CC

IMO Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in 9192
playing a combination of good offense 3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games and
good defense  But he playing the first part of this season in Kansas City
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it then appears that
9192 was a fluke  Although he improved towards the end of the season he
was prone to being out of position defensively and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen last
year  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year

4	JAYSON MORE		Season 2nd
Acquired	9192 from Montreal in expansion draft
Grade		B

After being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training camp
before 9192 More had a rather disappointing 9192 as he was not
particularly good defensively and had just 17 points in 46 games  He then
proceeded to improve his game massively this season becoming the teams most
reliable defenseman whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional but only occasional offensive flash
Offensively he was even more disappointing than last year 11 points in 73
games but his defense improved tremendously  He is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman

5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season 4th
Acquired	9192 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		B

Wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in 9192  However
partially because of injuries he was not the same this year as he missed 25
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries and seemed to be slowed
even when playing  He then had often to be saved by his defensive partners
that is if they are there at all  But he also had some solid games and if
he can be complete healthy he can still be a force

6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season 1st
Acquired	9192 2nd round pick in entry draft
Grade		I A

At the time of his injury December 30 against the Philadelphia Flyers
Ozolinsh was well on track to be IMO the teams MVP  A serious knee injury
in that game though forced him to miss the rest of the season 47 games
but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen 23 points
which of course tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from
their defensemen but it also tells of Ozolinshs abilities  At the time he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still
susceptible to socalled rookie mistakes but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team rookie or veteran  If he can come back
from his injuries he is ready to be a star

19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season 1st
Acquired	9192 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		B

Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year being one of the only two Sharks
to play in all 84 games of the season  He was solid on defense but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman he didnt show it 15 points
He was also prone to penalties and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the
team however that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents and he was at his best when playing physically  But to
become a fixture in this league he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively and cut down on the number of powerplays he gives to opponents


GO CALGARY FLAMES  Al MacInnis for Norris  Gary Roberts for Hart and Smythe
GO EDMONTON OILERS  Go for playoffs next year  Stay in Edmonton
