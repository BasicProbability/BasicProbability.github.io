   DEG has many germanborn forwards in the team In fact the majority of players
   are germanborn 199293 DEG had 11150 average in 11800 spectator arena
  
  Interesting One of our German friends here Robert told me their forwards
  were all CanadianGermans Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us
 
 As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one CanadianGerman forward ie a  player
 who was born in Canada but now has a German passport 
 Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play 
 for Germany in the WC
 
 The other Canadaborn forwards are
 	PeterJohn Lee has British passport
 	Chris Valentine
 	Dale Dercatch
 	Steve Gootas
  	Earl Spry 
 
 At the moment there are only three Germanborn forwards coming into my mind
 	Bernd Trunschka Andreas Brockmann Ernst Koepf
 
Hm do you think Dusseldorf fans would like it if their team joined the NHL
Or do we have to include Koln as well Cologne to you Anglophiles to make 
them happy
