 I saw a mask once that had drawings of bandaids presumably for every puck
 that goalie stopped with his facehead  I cant remember who it was or even
 if it was NHL I see quite a few AHL games here

Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over
it

Ken Drydens mask is a classic  an archetype of our time
