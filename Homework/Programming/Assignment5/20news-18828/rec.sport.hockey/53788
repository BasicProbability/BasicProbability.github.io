Subject Does anybody have the schedule for games Sunday 25 Apr 93


Hello Hockey fans
Bonjour tout le monde

Well in Salt Lake City this past Sunday the local ABC station decided not
to televise the hockey games  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde
Anyway I have a satellite dish and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday 25 Apr and I can
not find correct game times  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing
everything from 1100 AM MDT to 500 PM MDT

I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday now
that ABC has mucked up the schedule  I think I should be able to
pull in
three games 1100 am 200 pm and 530 pm MDT off the dish but I am
not sure

IF anybody has a schedule pleas emial it to me  As you can see I have to
telent to get recsporthockey and it is sometimes difficult to get a link

Thanks in advance
Merci davance

PS  Anglais ou francais daccord
