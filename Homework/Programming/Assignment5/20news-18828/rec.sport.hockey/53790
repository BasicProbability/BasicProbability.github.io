On 20Apr93 in Don Cherry  Coachs Corner

Next a clip was shown from an earlier episode in which Don was
proclaiming Doug Gilmour to be the best player not only in
the NHL but in the world What about players like Lemieux
Don said that Gilmour was the best PLAYER not Designated point getter
Its not like baseball where you have a designatted hitter who
can score runs but cant play defense Gilmour is a good two way player

This clip was shown on local news in Pittsburgh last night KDKA complete
with animated sarcasm by the sportscaster  Its the second time Cherry
has been shown on local Pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks  Both
times he was blasting Lemieux


His designated pointgetter remarks were not only meant for Lemieux
but for Gretzky Bure etc etc  and he made those particular
remarks last December before Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkins
and as the Leafs started their second half roll and before
Gilmours great season was being recognized by many people
