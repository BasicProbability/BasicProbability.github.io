 According to this mornings PostGazette
 
 The Pens will be carried by KDKARadio1020 am unless the Pirates
 are playing  When the Pirates play the games will be carried by 
 WDVE1025 fm  WDVE will carry 12 games starting with tonights
 game
 
 In fact after this season KDKA will no longer be the flagship
 station for the Pens  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new 
 deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games  It seems
 more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next 
 season  KBL will carry 62 games on tv  with 17 of the games to be 
 simulcast on KDKATV  The remaining 22 games as well as some of the 
 early round playoff games will be available by subscription tv only
 To receive the games youll have to pay a one time hook up fee and
 then a monthly fee of 1112 dollars
 
 Also under the new deal there will no longer be radiotv 
 simulcasts  There will be a TV broadcast team and a radio
 broadcast team  
 
 No word on who the announcers will be  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald
 are both under contract with KDKA but their contracts expire at the
 end of this season  KBL President Bill Craig said hed like to hire
 Lange and Steigerwald

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Whos the mindscheme behind this one  Ted
Simmons  As the saying goes If it aint broke dont fix it  Im 230
miles from home during the school year and will never be able to pick up
DVE  At least now I can sort of make out what Mike and Steigy say through
all the static on KDKA  This just may be enough reason for me to transfer
to Duquesne and live at home  Whos going to announce on DVE anyway 
Paulson and Krenn  Just kidding
