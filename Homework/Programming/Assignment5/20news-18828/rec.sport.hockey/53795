Subject Bowman whining already

I should have guessed Its time for the annual Pittsburgh Penguins
whineathon Bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the Devils in
Game 1 Im sorry Mr Bowman youre a great coach but those cheap
shots were nothing compared to whats going to come Also I guess you
were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white
Its amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do 

PS  Nice dive on that high stick Mario Everyone knew it was a high
stick you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent
for later

just stirring it up a bit
Ralph
