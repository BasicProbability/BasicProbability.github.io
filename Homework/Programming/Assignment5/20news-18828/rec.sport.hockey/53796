 	CBC had a great chance for some double headers  TorontoDetroit
 and VancouverWinnipeg but today they said that the East gets the Leafs
 and the West get the Vancouver game  I thought that they would show them
 both

Im totally pod too  VancouverWinnipeg is great westcoast hockey 
fastpaced and loads of talent  What Ive seen so far is hardly
entertaining with the exception of the odd shift every now  then of
course I missed CalgaryLA  PittsJersey

No because the PINHEADS at CBC figure everyone here in Ontario cares
for the Leafs the Maple Leafs and nothing but the Leafs  Half of
Southern Ontario is people who moved from out west but the good folks
in Toronto couldnt care less  They should show the doubleheader
heck the second game would have two Canadian teams and let those
desperate for news watch The National on Newsworld but they dont
Why Because Canada ends at Windsor doncha know   Grrrrr

Amen

Now I have to get updates every 30 mins on CNN Headline News for
crying out loud

Thats cheaper than what I do  PHONE CALLS  There must be a better
system  one ring Adams to Linden he SCORES two rings Bure rushes up
the ice he SCORES etc etc
