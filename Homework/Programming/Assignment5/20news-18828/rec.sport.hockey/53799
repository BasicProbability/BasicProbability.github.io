Gerald Murray wasnt responsible for Primeau although Im not
ready to admit thats a horrible pick  They hired him after the
draft which has never made sense to me  His first pick was
Lapointe


I dont think Primeau is necessarily a bad pickIm was just trying
to locate the beginning of Murrays decisionshe slowness in trading
Carson has delayed Primeaus developmentand you have to wait longer
for big players oftenand Primeau can be a very good player without
being a pointagameplayer especially on a team that has Yzerman and
Fedorovif Primeau becomes Joel Otto and gets 20 goals a season
and plays meanit will have been an extremely good pick

Gerald
