A little Bio from SunSentinel
Torrey the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders
Throughout his 27 years in the NHL Bill Torreys bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassis hair

The Panthers will introduce a uniform insignia and ticketprice 
information in early next month  In the meantime Huizenga leaves the
daytoday operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke the VP and
GM


The San Jose Sharks and Ottawa Senators are each on their second GM
alreadyId be willing to wager that both the Sharks and Senators
will probably see their 3rd GMs and perhaps their 4th before we
see the Panthers second
