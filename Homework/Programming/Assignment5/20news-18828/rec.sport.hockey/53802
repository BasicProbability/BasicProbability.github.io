 Speaking of great players manohman can Quebec skate  I havent seen a
 team so potent on the rush in a long time  Watching them break out of their
 zone especially Sundin is a treat to watch  They remind me of the Red 
 Army  

 dchhabrastplistsca pissedoff Habs fan

Yeah the Nords look like theyre going to be goodbut excuse the
bias have you ever watched the Pens on a rushDont answer everyone
has seen this footage  Near the end of the season when the Pens played
the Nords it was like watching a younger double of the Pens  The
Nords looked good right up to the point when they lost
