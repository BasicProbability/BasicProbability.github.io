Subject Re ABC coverage

 I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the JerseyPitt series  Show
 the shots not the hits  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
 on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot  They panned
 back to show the rebound  Maybe Moms camera people were a little more 
 experienced

Exactly  That is my biggest complaint about the coverage so far
Follow that damn puck
