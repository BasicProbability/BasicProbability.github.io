What are the Leafs to do  I am a Leaf supporter and
I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there
is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits
Pat Burns

If you were Pat Burns what would you do


Pray for the Wings to become lazy and overconfidentthe Wings
can only lose the seriesToronto cannot win it  Take away
Doug Gilmour and the Leafs are an old Tampa Bay

The Leafs deserve a lot of credit for their diligent effort
during the regular seasonbut if Detroit puts in a reasonable
effort this is not a contest
