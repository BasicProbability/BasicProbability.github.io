              AndreychuckBorchevsy  vs Detroit checking line
              Torontos checking line  vs YzermanFedorovProbert pray lots

 
 Well Im a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponents line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them  There is no YzermanFedorovProbert line except for maybe on a
powerplay  These three players usually play on three different lines
Which would mean that Torontos checking line would have to pull a triple
shift
The Wings lines usually look like this
 
                      GallantYzermanCiccarelli
 
                      KozlovFedorovDrake
