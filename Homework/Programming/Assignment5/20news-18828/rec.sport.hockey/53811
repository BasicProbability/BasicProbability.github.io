Pray for the Wings to become lazy and overconfidentthe Wings
can only lose the seriesToronto cannot win it  Take away
Doug Gilmour and the Leafs are an old Tampa Bay

Right Gerald  And take away Bob Probert and the Wings are dead Octopuses

The Leafs deserve a lot of credit for their diligent effort
during the regular seasonbut if Detroit puts in a reasonable
effort this is not a contest

Lets wait for the body to get cold before we start in with the eulogies
hm  They have only lost ONE game  The game was in Detroit after all and
Potvin did not have his best evening  Nobody that I saw thought that the
Leafs would sweep the Wings  It looks like it might go six  The Leafs
will take the Wings home advantage away in the next game
