 and Ill give Fuhrs new one an honourable mention although I havent
seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  

This is the new Buffalo one the second since hes been with the
Sabres  I recall a price tag of over 700 just for the paint job on
that mask and a total price of almost 1500  Ouch
