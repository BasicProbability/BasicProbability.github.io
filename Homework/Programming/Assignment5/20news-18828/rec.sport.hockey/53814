 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Whos the mindscheme behind this one  Ted
 Simmons  As the saying goes If it aint broke dont fix it  Im 230

 DVE  At least now I can sort of make out what Mike and Steigy say through
 all the static on KDKA  This just may be enough reason for me to transfer
 to Duquesne and live at home  Whos going to announce on DVE anyway 
 Paulson and Krenn  Just kidding
