 Ok heres the solution to your problem  Move to Canada  Yesterday I was able
 to watch FOUR gamesthe NJPITT at 100 on ABC LACAL at 300 CBC 
 BUFFBOS at 700 TSN and FOX and MONQUE at 730 CBC  I think that if
 each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40some odd
 consecutive nights I havent counted so thats a pure guess

The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year  I had the Rangers
on MSG and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time  Yes
Id rather have SC cover it just for the amount of coverage

 
 Btw those ABC commentaters were great  I was quite impressed they seemed
 to know that their audience wasnt likely to be wellschooled in hockey lore
 and they did an excellent job  They were quite impartial also IMO

I think Thorne earns his money  The best part is that he is the same way when 
he is earning his  from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer ie
unbiased  He goes orgasmic for goals despite which team scores and even more 
excited if possible for great saves  He did a good job of explaining certain 
things to nonhockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport
unlike NBCs clowns for the ASG

      Dont any of you Pittsburgh fans tell me how Mike Lange is better 
      Maybe if he were a little spontaneous rather than reading rehearsed
      lines of BS having nothing to do with hockey he would be better
