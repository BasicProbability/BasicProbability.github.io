 Youll have a hard time selling any sport to a community that
 cant play it on account of availability or financial reasons
 Hockey is pretty much a sport for the white and well off

What is this crap Im only interested in intelligent discussion If you 
cant answer my question just say so Can anyone else answer the ques


	Its not really crap you know only half crap    From what i 
understand its very expensive to play hockey south of the border 
actually its not that cheap up hear either though once you have all the
equipement its not more than 300 a year actually i haven played in
about 8 years so i could be off a bit   In the states where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year compare 
this to baseball and youll see that hockey is a sport for the welltodo
And this brings up the fact that the welltodo in the US are majority white

BTW what was the original question i think it has to do with the Hispanic
communtiy and playing hockey
