And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other 
team captain trivia would be appreciated

Wasnt Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to
Pittsburgh

Mom

Chris Chelios was Montreals cocaptain with Guy Carbonneau when he
was traded to Chicago for Denis Savard and Peter Stastny was captain 
of the Quebec Nordiques when he was traded to NewJersey Also Mark 
Messier was captain of the Edmonton Oilers when he was traded to New
York How about Dale Hawerchuk with Winnipeg when he was traded to
Buffalo was he captain too  I think so I should not forget Wayne 
you know who when he was traded to LA he was captain Didnt they 
strip Wendel Clark of his captaincy in Toronto 


Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up Ramseys now a Penguin  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno whos now a leaf  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff who went I forget where  Ruff had it from Perreault who
retired so I guess thats where the streak started  Or did it
After all Danny Gare was captain before him and he went to Detroit
Jim Scoenfeld Gerry Meehan and Floyd Smith are the others in
reverse order last to first  I was a bit young at the time so Im
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston  Meehan went to Vancouver Atlanta and Washington  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo but I dont know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that or how many games he
played for Buffalo  This is actually getting fascinating  

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign youre to be traded almost
unless youre a franchise player
