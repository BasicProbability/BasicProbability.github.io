The San Francisco Bay area media is reporting tonight that the Detroit
Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 63  Can someone who is not
part of the media conspiracy against the Leafs tell me how the game
really went I am expecting a 40 win for the Leafs shutout for
Potvin hat trick for Andreychuk and a goal and 3 assists for
Gilmour  If the Leafs really lost how many penalties did whichever
biased ref was at the game have to call against the Leafs to let the
Red Wings win

Ah yes  California  Did the San Francisco Bay area media report that
Joe Montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired
San Jose Sharks coach George Kingston  Apparently Montana is not only
coveted for his winning attitude but as a playing coach he will be
expected to quarterback the powerplay

	Close Roger but no banana er avocado or is it artichoke 

	Geracie in the Murky News said Kingston will be the new 49ers
	quarterback  Im still trying to determine if he is kidding
	or not   If I happen to pound down enuff pints sometime 
	this week Ill go back and check what stooper idiot Purdy
	said in his column  That ought to be worth a few Leafs I
	mean Laughs   If Im really depressed Ill read the SF Comicle

	mark

 just say
