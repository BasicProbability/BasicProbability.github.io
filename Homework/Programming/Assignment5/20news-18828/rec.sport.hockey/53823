Subject Leafs versus Wings

How long can the Leafs play shorthanded and still be expected to
score  They did some fine penelykilling in the first 2 men down
for a couple of minutes at one point but they just couldnt keep it 
up  They spent virtually the entire game either shorthanded or
just coming off a penelty  as soon as theyd get regrouped theyre
penalized again
 
Sheesh  like Gilmour said after the 1st  you cant go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that  And if youre going
to you have to do it for both teams
 
Pearson one of my four favorite Leafs played like a bonehead  I
saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities and
then he got that bonehead 5minute major highsticking penalty
 
Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a handfull of
games ago and he played a good game  If the other players on his line
can smarten up that line should do okay  Clarks got to get tough 
hes got to intimidate and go for the net  Send Clark up the left 
wing over the blue line a couple times his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board and Pearson heck maybe he should
be benched
 
I hate to repeat Grapes but where the heck was Foligno  Zezel cant
do all the checking himself  and get MacLlwain on the move we 
need some speed out there  Keep Potvin in net he did okay 
considering although like I said a couple weeks ago Potvin 
messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year  he can 
easily do it again
 
My prediction last week was Toronto in 7  that the games DET wins 
will be blowouts and the game TOR wins will be close  I still stand
by that
 
Dont fret Leafs fans in order to win in 7 the other team has to
win 3 
 
Burns is going to make some magic  hell mix up some lines  Match
the Wings lineperline  Hell have his team checking hard and hell
never let them get outnumbered in their own end  The Leafs will win
Wednesday night and will take 1 or their home games probably the
first one
