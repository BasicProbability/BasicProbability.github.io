 	Are people here stupid or what It is a tie breaker of cause they
 have to have the same record How can people be sooooo stuppid to put win as
 first in the list for tie breaker If it is a tie breaker how can there be
 different record Man I thought people in this net are good with hockey
 I might not be great in Math but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points
 with different record Manretard Cant believe people actually put
 win as first in a tie breaker

Then allow me to enlighten you Rex You see theres a thing called a tie 
A tie is worth one point I know I know Youre not good at math But bear
with me A win is worth two points So getting two ties is the same as 
getting one win If your team played two games won one and lost one youd
have two points If my team played two games and tied them both wed also
have two points Wed be tied in the standings even though our records are
different

Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again I am
starting to sound like Roger or what
