I cant believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look good

But only in NYNJ Philadelphia and Chicago Everywhere else the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts
And local baseball preempted the NHL playoffs Thus far into this
playoff season ESPNABC has given me more hockey in 2 days 1 game
than SportsChannel did 0 games

If people want hockey on TV they should watch hockey on TV I bet the
ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet Next week there
will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey

Someone in this thread said that he wouldnt watch the games even if
they were on TV and this is a rsh regular contributor

Xenophobes north of border neednt fear the USAmericanization of our
game because USAmericans will never figure out how to market hockey
here Support your team support your game
 
 Mike Eisler mreEngSunCom  Not only are they Leafs the best team but
 their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburghs  Their
 players are mighty bright too  I mean he really was going to get his
 wallet back right Jan Brittenson 393 on LeafPen woofers in
