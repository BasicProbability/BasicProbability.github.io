Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref presently in the NHL
He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques
The Nords penalty came in OT  Stewart being an exNordique himself
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murderWE WAS ROBBED

No  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending that
goaltending was the key etc etc  Well the key doesnt quite fit if youre
Montreal  

I dont buy this at all Roy was the reason the game was tied and that
would not have been the case had Dionne kept his cool 
Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself 
Both Dionnes and Bellows shots were misplayed by Hextall but just because
his gaffes were early in the game no one seems to care Roy stood on his head 
for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from 
endtoend Kamenskys minibreak after the tying goal and the first shot by 
Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy Roy outplayed Hextall 
for most of the game but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero 
because Roys team didnt make full use of their opportunities

Hextall on the other hand had a lot of lucky bounces  he played very 
well but the Haller shot off the post in OT the rebound bouncing over 
Bellows stick the Brunet breakaway the 3 chances for LeClair  all 
those opportunities were not finished off by Montreal and it cost them
Hextall wasnt particularly brilliant on those plays  

Blaming Stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow  He even saw the whole shot dammit

Sure no excuse  but it was just the 1 goal The timing stank but against
an explosive team like Quebec they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary

Montreal played a solid game although they still dont know how to clear
traffic in front of the net the loss of Schneider will hurt even more 

I disagree Roy played well because he wasnt screened the whole night 
The defense for the 1st time this season played remarkably keeping Sakic
Nolan and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night

Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2goal lead with less than 
five let alone two minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME 
ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads But I dont
think this was a team loss although Keane should have been able to clear 
the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal  

This most certainly was a team loss Leclair missed his opportunities
as did Bellows and Brunet Dionne took a bad penalty Damphousse and Lebeau
were silent Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night Roy gave
up the bad goal Roy by no means can be singled out for this loss

Roy is paid big money to 
play  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakics shot

And Hextall didnt on Dionnes goal Please Roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies  and he still is in the top 5
when you consider the defense or lack of one that played in front of him
for most of the season

Demers should start Racicot in the next game  If not that he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or twoand maybe this
article if possible

The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the Habs They are no better than uninformed fans Why should
they read the papers They played 58 minutes of Burnsian hockey to shut
down Quebec All they need tonight and for the rest of the series is the 
extra 2

Red Light to face Quebecrubbish Thats a guaranteed way to end the
series 40 Who would be taught a lesson by this 
The fans the media and Racicot perhaps Certainly not the rest of the team

I didnt think the wraparound was as bad as the second goal  I also didnt
think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender cant remember who
in the first place  But you are correct it shouldnt have gone in
regardless

If you mean the goal should never have gone in because there should never
have been an OT then I agree But the goal itself was a great piece of work
by Young Roy had both the near and far posts covered but Young flipped the
puck up under Roys arm as he wrappedaround the net  not a bad goal at all
