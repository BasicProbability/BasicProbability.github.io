Subject Re Bay area media WingsLeafs coverage

	Yeah the news is truethe Leafs lost to the Wings 63
Wish I could say Id seen the whole game but my husband wanted
to watch Young Guns II on another channel Sometime between
the first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time
I tuned in and heard the score was 51 something happened
	Please no woofing from Red Wings fans  Theyre my third
favourite team and if they make it past the Leafs Ill wish them
luck  As for Potvinwell it WAS his fist playoff game
