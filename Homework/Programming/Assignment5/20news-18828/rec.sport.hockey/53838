I mean that the original poster was looking for a Devils victory
on the tape delay and it didnt happen in game 1

I was the original poster and it was just a complaint about the
coverage meaningless Yankee game before playoff Devils game

Oh  I apologize thenI misinterpreted you

No problem no offence taken 

Of all the teams in the Patrick I least dislike the Devils

It is sad just as a lover of the sport that this team can be in
the metro New York area for over a decade and still exist as just
a nonentity 

How is ESPNs coverage anyways I think it starts tonight

Were getting the SabresBruins as the replacement game and probably
so are you while the DevilsPenguins game is played on SCNY and the
IslandersCaps are the overflow game on the SCA SCNY Plus  If the
SabresBruins ends early then well go to the DevilsPenguins game
assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns we got the last
minute of the IslandersRangers and all of the overtime two weeks
ago  ESPNs coverage started last night by accident but as one
or more other writers have pointed out they couldve gone to wild
hog wrestling for the evening instead
