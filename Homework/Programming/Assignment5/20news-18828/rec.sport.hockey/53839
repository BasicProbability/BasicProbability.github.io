I cant believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look good

But only in NYNJ Philadelphia and Chicago Everywhere else the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts

Yes a point welltaken  however even in areas that finally got
some games theres something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news Theres an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City
and well try to get you an update through the show  when you
know that its on a satellites feedhorn somewhere up there 

If people want hockey on TV they should watch hockey on TV I bet 
the ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet 

From todays Times ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St Louis a
42 and the KingsFlames got a 29 on the West Coast but only a 22
in metro New York ie the Devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the Rangers   In comparison
Seniors Golf did better 

Next week there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey

I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great 
I cant tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not cos I dont
watch much TV  the NHL should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air  Even ESPN couldve sold second
rights to third party systems ie nonSportsChannel since they
are not making any extra money by sitting on the games  hockey
fans will not necessarily be watching preseason beach volleyball
if playoffs games arent being shown somewhere
