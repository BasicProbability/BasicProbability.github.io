Subject Hockey coverage

This is a general question for US readers

How extensive is the playoff coverage down there  In Canada it is almost
impossible not to watch a series on TV ie the only two series I have not had
an opportunity to watch this year are WashNYI and ChiStl the latter because
Im in the wrong time zone  We in Canada are basically swamped with 
coverage and I wonder how many seriesgames are televised nationally or even
locally in the US and how much precedence they take over say local news if
the games go into doubleOT

Email me so as not to waste bandwidth please  My news feed is kind of slow
anyways
