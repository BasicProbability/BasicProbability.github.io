  from Anna Matyas
 Now if we could just clone Chelioss personality and transplant it
 into all of the defensemen on the Islanders Capitals and Devils
  
 Gerald
  
 In other words you want to turn them all into assholes so they
 will spend lots of time in the penalty box and get lots of
 misconducts
  
 And this comes from a Chelios fan
  
  Yeah and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35
  minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
  best defenseman in the league Id take a whole team of Chelioses if I
  could That way when one got a penalty the others could kill it
