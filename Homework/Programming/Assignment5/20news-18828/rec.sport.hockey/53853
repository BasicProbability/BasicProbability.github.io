 Thanks for the goals by Steve Smith 
I dont see why more people dont blame grant fuhr for the goal that smith 
put in his own net its common to play the puck back to your own goalie when
deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team
If fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line

Mike McDowell

I have to disagree with you on this one  It is anything BUT common  In the
4 or 5 years I have been watching hockey I have NEVER seen this happen EVER

I am not sure what league you have been watching  

Anyone else agree with this

Yes Colin I have to agree with you here  Ive put the puck in
my own net the same way Smith did only once mind you  and it
was definitely my fault  It is NOT a common play to play the puck the
way that Smith did  

Luckily for me  when I did it it was only a scrimmage
