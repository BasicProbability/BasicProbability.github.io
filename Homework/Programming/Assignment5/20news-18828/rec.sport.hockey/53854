Subject Blues into playoffs beat TB 65

By Dave Luecking Of The PostDispatch Staff

At 911 Thursday night the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer
Their cheer quickly turned into a roar and finally the sellout crowd of
17816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to
the playoffbound Blues

The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit  Red Wings 5 Stars 3
With the North Stars loss the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the
final playoff spot in the Norris Division Good thing because the Blues quit
playing

They held a 51 lead over Tampa Bay when the DetroitMinnesota final appeared
with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period They promptly went to sleep
and barely held on for a 65 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer
Tampas Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers but officiating
supervisor John DAmico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the
shot had gone into the net after time had expired

Im glad I didnt see it go in at the end Blues coach Bob Berry said

If the goal had counted hed have been more upset than he was by the Blues
disappearance in the final 24 minutes Holding on for the victory and making
the playoffs tempered Berrys anger

It wasnt pretty at the end he said We played 36 37 great minutes as
good as we played all year It slipped away at the end It shouldnt have but
it did

Still the Blues won prompting another ovation from the crowd at games end
Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this
season the Blues still made the playoffs Theyll meet the Chicago Blackhawks
in a bestofseven Norris Division semifinal beginning at noon Sunday at
Chicago Stadium

The Blues finished the regularseason with a record of 373611 for 85 points
their fourth consecutive plus500 season Minnesota finished three points
behind in fifth place with a record of 3638 10 for 82 points Tampa Bay
which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 22 at Tampa ended its
first season with a record of 23547 for 53 points

The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous
Blues locker room Instead the mood was one of relief and some disappointment

Its a shame we let down said Kevin Miller one of three Blues to score
two goals Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others
There was no need for a letdown If wed have kept working it would have
ended 62 and everyone would be happy

Instead a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs
We won and thats all that matters said Brett Hull scoreless and minus3
for the night Once we got up 40 it was really tough to play

Some players didnt have a problem

Just because the score was announced our line didnt quit said Rich
Sutter who played with Bassen and Miller We still had a game to play You
cant allow five goals like we did thats not right

It was disappointing to see what was going on

Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues effort Somehow
he missed the announcement of Minnesotas loss

I didnt know it was final he said I was kind of looking around on the
bench I didnt realize it was a final for some reason Were in the playoffs
and thats great but its a little disappointing to play like we did at the
end

The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard
operators to keep the MinnesotaDetroit score off of the board The score
showed 00 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 42 in the third
period The Blues already led 40 at the time

I told them I didnt want to see the score I didnt want to know the score
Berry said I felt we had to win the game and thats the approach we took

If Minnesota took a lead Berry feared the pressure of having to win might
bother the Blues If Detroit led he worried the Blues might quit

Until the announcement the Blues played splendidly Shanahan got the crowd
going at 1044 of the first period scoring his 50th of the season Then
Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period

With the teams playing four on four Miller broke in on left wing deked
defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the
rebound of his own shot with 216 seconds remaining in the period

Then just 105 seconds later Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski
after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone

Bassen made it 40 just 14 seconds into the second period scoring on the 
rebound of Bret Hedicans shot The goal gave him his first twogoal game of
the season and reminded him of a special friend

Last year Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill who died of a rare form
of cancer at age 6 on Feb 23

I was thinking of my buddy Oliver Bassen said Hes in heaven now and
I know he was watching I know hes happy

Miller increased the Blues lead to 50 on a breakaway goal set up by Zombo
at 1109 Then Steve Maltais broke Curtis Josephs shutout just 18 seconds
later making it 51

Less than a minute after the North Stars final was announced Tim Bergland
scored and cut the lead to 52 But Shanahan scored his 51st converting a pass
from Nelson Emerson with 213 seconds remaining in the  second period

Then it was all Lightning Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third
period prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph Guy Hebert allowed goals
to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 121 midway through the third
period

The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahans second goal stand up as the
winner We were in there Shanahan said The game was over We were in
