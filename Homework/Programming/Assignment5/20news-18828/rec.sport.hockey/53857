Subject Re European expansion and our fcked system


 
 How long would they support teams that are run on Rangerbased 
 corporate thinking I use the term lightly  We dont need a good
 product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawas
 record every year1940 haha sorry had ta say it

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams but the Maple Leafs and a
certain dead man who was in charge were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport  Guess what they were immensely popular at the
gate  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row

 Look at British or any European soccer as an example they never have fan
 problems

Ha  Such humor  They have MAJOR fan problems namely that on occasion some of
them dont make it home from the match  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical
much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
they play pathetically
