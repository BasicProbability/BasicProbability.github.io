The Ottwawa Senators fired Mel Bridgman at 100 PM today
Randy Sexton is gonna replace him

Trashy move from a trashy organization After the front
office stated that nobody would lose their job over the
Sens poor performance Bridgeman is gone within 24 hours
of the teams final game

YesI know he screwed up letting the Kings grab Loach

Sextons qualifications aside from being cheap

	 he played some US college hockey
	 hes pals with club president Bruce Firestone

Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build
an expansion franchise Hell probably be in the Hall of
Fame next year 

This continues a tradition of front office gaffs
 Paul Anka and the arena deal
 Denis Potvin and the GM postion
 Mike Bossy and the scoring coach

How do people in Ottawa feel about how the club is being run
