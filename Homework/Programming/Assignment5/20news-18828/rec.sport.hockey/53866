It is really annoying to see all of these
predictions on the Net  Who really cares
who you think will win  Please stop with
the predictions we all know the Caps are
going to win the Cup so let it go at that

Yeah but first they have to deal with the Devils
whove had their number all year Im not saying
the Caps arent a good team theyve been a thorn
on the Habs side for the past 10 years just
that they wont get past NJ
