Farewell Minnesota fans  Get stuffed Dallas Stars

As the North Stars fade to black I hope that MinneapolisSt Paul are
not long without an NHL team  It just seems right that the hotbed of
amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well  The loss of
the team is certainly not the fault of the fans though the start of the
198990 season made it look real bad for a while

I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf
Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980  I got it
to spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up  What a
glorious season that was for the North Stars
