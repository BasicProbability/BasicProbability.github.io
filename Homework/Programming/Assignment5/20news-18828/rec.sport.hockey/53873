My vote goes to John Vanbiesbrouck  His mask has a skyline of New York
City and on the sides there are a bunch of bees Beezer  It looks
really sharp

Funny you should mention this one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbroucks mask  He hated it  I think he said something to the effect
of
You see  He was great last year now he goes out and gets that dopey mask 
and he cant stop a beachball

You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all but I cracked up when I heard
it

I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw  I also like
Moogs and Ill give Fuhrs new one an honourable mention although I havent
seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  Whats also neat is
Chevaldaes in Detroit they call him Chevy so he has two checkered flags
painted at the top as in an auto race
