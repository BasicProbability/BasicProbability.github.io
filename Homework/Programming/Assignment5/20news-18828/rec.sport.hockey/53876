Subject Re Truly a sad day for hockey


Joel Alvstad writes

A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight as the Minnesota North Stars 
or Norms Stars whichever you prefer lost to the Red Wings by a score of
53  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen who netted
two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to
play

This is very sad indeed  My condolences to the Minnesota fans who are
losing their team

I fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team
left in Pittsburgh will be the Steelers

We should always enjoy things when we can  You never know when theyll
be taken away from us
