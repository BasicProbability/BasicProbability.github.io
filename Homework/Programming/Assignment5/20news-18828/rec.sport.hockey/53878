Subject Re 1993 NHL Draft

When is the draft this year  And will there be any coverage
I know the upcomming NFL draft is on ESPN

Anyone got the details

Paul Kariya 1993 1 Pick No 2 perhaps  He wont last long 

I dont know the exact coverage in the states  In Canada it is covered
by TSN so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage  I dont know

As for the picks
Ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that Alexander Daigle will 
go 1 Hell either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec  IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didnt show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think thats it or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong

Because of expansion I wont go further but I will name other of the
blue chip prospects

    Chris Gratton
    Chris Pridham
    a swedish player who I cant remember his name

Draft Order

1 Ottawa
2 San Jose
3 Tampa Bay
4 South Florida or Anahiem
5 South Florida or Anahiem
6 Hartford
7 Edmonton
8 Dallas
9 NY Rangers
10 Philadelphia

the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong  I dont have the standings here
and am guessing 

In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft with Kariya 
 leading the way but not going 1

Shawn  GO CAPS two first round picks for the next three years  THANKS
                 STLOUIS or should I say RON CARON and SCOTT STEVENS
