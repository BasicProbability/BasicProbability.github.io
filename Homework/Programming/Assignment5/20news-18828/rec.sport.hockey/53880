Various justifiable rantings on ESPN coverage by several deleted


The only way to change ESPNs thinking if it is even possible is to complain
to them directly  Anyone know there telephone  in Bristol Ct  

Heh Try the recautossport FAQ They are always calling ESPN to complain
Im sure you could find the number for ABC there too as many westcoast 
viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into
the Long Beach GP 


I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesnt think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring gameI know I did  And then when
they didnt show the NYIWash overtimes I was livid  If I wanted
to watch baseball I could have turned on the PhilliesPadres extra
inning gameinstead I went to bed angryI boycotted ESPNs
morning Sportscenter today I was still so incensed

Were you and several of the other people here it seems asleep the day
contracts were explained ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST
show that baseball game if it happens Many businesses payedd money to
have their commercials run during a baseball game This is a business
not your own personal video servant


My wife says I shouldnt go to bed angry but last niteGRRRRRRR


Maybe you should put that anger into something positive For example I saw
ads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts Why not write to
Dodge saying that thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS 
you will now concider their products in the future They love to hear stuff
like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time
for hockey games giving ESPN and other networks more incentive to carry
games just one example

Come on people as great as we think it is Hockey does not leapfrog the
big three overight
