And of course Mike Ramsey was at one time the captain in Buffalo prior to
being traded to Pittsburgh  Currently the Penguins have 3 former captains
and 1 real captain Lemieux playing for them  They rotate the As during the
season and even the C while Mario was out  Even Troy Loney has worn the C
for the Pens


I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he
got traded to the Leafs Also wasnt Rick Vaive the captain of
the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago with Steve Thomas for
Ed Olcyzk and someone Speaking of the Leafs I believe that
Darryl Sittler was their captain hed torn the C off his
jersey but I think he reclaimed the captaincy later on when he
was traded to the Flyers

Oh yeah of course Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before
he was traded wasnt he 

Dale Hawerchuk and Troy Murray were both captains of the Jets
when they were traded  Murray this year in midseason Hawerchuk
a few years ago in the offseason
