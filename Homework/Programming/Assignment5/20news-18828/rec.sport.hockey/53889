The San Jose Sharks and Ottawa Senators are each on their second GM
alreadyId be willing to wager that both the Sharks and Senators
will probably see their 3rd GMs and perhaps their 4th before we
see the Panthers second

Actually firedcoach George Kingston was a third of the GM
triumvirate  Now that the trio is now duo Dean Lombardi and Chuck
Grillo the Sharks are already on their 3rd office of the GM And a
4th is likely to happen before September theyll either add the new
coach to the OofGM or name a single GM So your wager should be
amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the
Panthers get their 2nd Cant wait to see how the next seasons NHL
Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks

Given the depth of next years draft the expansion draft rules and
the reputation of their GMs Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the
first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup  San Jose and Ottawa have
instability at the GM position something that Philly NYI Edmonton
and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups Pittsburgh
did but they needed a quarter century
 
Mike Eisler mreEngSunCom  Not only are they Leafs the best team but
 their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburghs  Their
 players are mighty bright too  I mean he really was going to get his
 wallet back right Jan Brittenson 393 on LeafPen woofers in
