I am in need of all of the players wearing 77 in the NHL  I know now only
of one Ray Borque for the Bruins  Any help would be greatly appreciated

I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear 77 when he played
with the Rangers in the 70s  This was the season that they put the
Rangers crest and modernstyle numbers on the jerseys instead of the
NEW YORK or RANGERS block letters and twocolour numbers  He took 77
because the Rangers already had a 7

Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it saying it was the
biggest uniform style change in a long time  This was before Pittsburgh
and Vancouver changed their colours
