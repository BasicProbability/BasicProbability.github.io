8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season	3rd
Acquired	9192 free agent from Minnesota
Grade		I CD

No netterfan watching the Sharks including me knows where DePalma was at
the end of the season the Sharks appeared to still have his rights but he
wasnt in San Jose he wasnt in Kansas City and his name hasnt appeared on
the waiver wire

Sorry Nelson but you forgot to ask me If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City youll find that Larry has been playing for the games having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 326 and the
416 issue 134 with 13 PIM Not exactly invisible

He then was sent down to
Kansas City walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of Shark Bytes as the mailing list is now known to Sharks
officials faithful and neither the Sharks nor we miss him

Well having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times this isnt quite
accurate He injured his back a disk injury and did one stupid thing
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble The Sharks then sent him to KC at which
point he disclosed the injury Since he didnt disclose it the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting That was eventually worked out the Sharks reinstated him as
injured and put him into therapy and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to KC He fully expects to play in the NHL again although clearly
not with the Sharks hiding injuries is a stupid nono beyond just a
nono

Very nice guy Always hustled his butt off He disappeared because he was
hurt I expect hell surface with another team at some point probably
another expansion team but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated Unfortunately he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call


20	JOHN CARTER		Season 4th
Acquired	9192 free agent from Boston
Grade		I BB

 He
is very unlikely to be back next season

Always gave 110 best work ethic on the club except maybe Kisio but
hustle isnt always enough His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board He literally had one arm around Ottos
neck and another wrapped around Ottos stick arm Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal as though Carter
wasnt there Hustle can only cover size so far

The Sharks have told me point blank that hes gone for good ditto HUbie
McDonough He was one of the favorites of the staff but as one said to me
you have to make room for the kids Carter in fact refused to report to
KC and has been suspended by the Sharks That might be a defacto
retirement but I havent heard anything official His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls

28	JEANFRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season 1st
Acquired	9192 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade		I BB

I dont understand why the Sharks didnt let Quintin play any more than the
14 games he played this season

Because at least from the games I saw him in he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice I think he shows potential but I didnt think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL

 He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season

Agreed BTW I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish theyd performed than how they actually performed I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television Nelson I know I have
trouble since you dont see the offpuck action your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways

41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season 1st
Acquired	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft
Grade		I 

After a allstar season at Kansas City Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the

Coffee Coffey is with the Red Wings

45	DODY WOOD		Season 1st
Acquired	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
Grade		I DD although perhaps I shouldnt give a grade at all

I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much

You Nah 

He was seriously unimpressive even as a tough guy his rep However as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless I hate
to judge the talent too quickly Butn in Dodys case Im tempted to make an
exception

But I wont
