Subject They guy who badmouthed Ulf

Ditto

If we allow people like him to continue to do what he does its a
shame  People say that cheap shots and drawing penalties by fake
ing is part of the game I say Bullsht  If he ever tried some
like that on a Yzerman hed would have to deal with Probert now
wouldnt he  What Ulf does isnt even retaliatory  Theres now
way one could justify what he does and if they do theyre fools
