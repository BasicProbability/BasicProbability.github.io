From Patrick Walker F1HHUNBCA
Subject Did you really expect Toronto to go anywhere  REALLY

Detroit is a very disciplined team  Theres a lot of Europeans
in Detroit which would make the game fast so Toronto would have
to slow the game down which means drawing penalties as a last
resort anyway  Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get
more good players  Toronto is just an average team Detroit isnt
Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner  Everyone knows that
and its going to take time for Toronto to become a real force
I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year  He cant pull the
whole team forever
