As for the picks
Ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that Alexander Daigle will 
go 1 Hell either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec  IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didnt show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think thats it or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong

The last name is Niedermayer as in New Jerseys Scotts last name because
you guessed it they are brothers  But Rob Niedermayer is a center not
a defenseman

I am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya  They arent saying much but
they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov along with Kariya  Chris
Prongers name has also been mentioned  My guess is that theyll take
Niedermayer  They may take Pronger except that they already have too many
defensive prospects


GO CALGARY FLAMES  Al MacInnis for Norris  Gary Roberts for Hart and Smythe
GO EDMONTON OILERS  Go for playoffs next year  Stay in Edmonton
