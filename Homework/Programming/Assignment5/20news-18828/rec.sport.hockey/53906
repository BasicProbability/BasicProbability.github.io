 	Today at the World Championships in Munich Canada scored an 
 impressive 31 victory over the defending World Champs Sweden 
 
In the game I have seen yesterday in the Olympiahalle of Munich
Canada won 41 against Sweden The last goal for Canada was at 1959 in
the 3rd period Maybe you shouldnt go and get you another beer 
before the game is over and then post imaginary results
