Playoffs

Stauber disturbed by thirdman theme
by Rick Sadowski Daily News

Barry Melroses decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender

I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most
fun time of the year and Im not  Stauber said with some emotion Monday  I
think I have worked hard enough for that

Stauber said he accepts Melroses choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays
63 opening victory

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No 3 man behind Rick
Knickle  Stauber had a 412 record and 298 goalsagainst average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No 1 job from Hrudey

Knickle  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 526 average twice was 
yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasnt played since March 29

Yet when the series resumes Wednesday Knickle will serve as Hrudeys backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn

If Im supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starterI
dropped too 3  What happened to No 2  Stauber wondered  Not that Id be
happy with No 2 but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25year old is capable of handling playoff pressure

While insisting he is the Kings goalie of the future Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season  They were
according to Melrose a 72 loss to San Jose on Dec 26 An 83 loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan 23 a 66 tie with Detroit on Feb 11 an 86 loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday

Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey and he didnt do it Melrose said  An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isnt satisfied to be a backup

Im not blaming Robb for the losses but if youre going to be No 1 youve
got to be able to walk your talk  Youve got to be able to play when everything
is on the line  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe I expect
more from him than he does

Ouch  That remark stung Stauber  He began the season 901 struggled when the
team hit a midseason slump didnt play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster then came on at the end

I expect more from myself than anybody including Barry Melrose said Stauber
a threeyear star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989 only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries

What Ive been through the last four years  two knee operations a herniated
disk in my back shoulder surgery  what more can I go through  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself otherwise I wouldnt be here

Anybody who would disagree with that doesnt know me  Im not saying Barry 
doesnt know me but dont say Ive been without expectations  If anything Im
a perfectionist

Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned But 
even though I didnt play well I get knocked down from maybe on to three Its 
a bit of a jump he said  Youre almost No 1 or if you play a good game 
youre No 1 and if you dont youre No 3  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 
and then a 75  Can you explain that  Thats what barry wanted me to explain 
to him why I didnt come through when he counted on me  I dont know What I 
do know is its a sport  Ill be there

Melroses goalie of the future statement doesnt mean much to Stauber Before
you know it Ill be 30 and there will be no future he said
