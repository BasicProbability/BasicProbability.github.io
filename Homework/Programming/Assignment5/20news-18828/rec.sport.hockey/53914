 Bill Ranford stopped 36 shots to lead Canada to a 41 victory in a very well
 played game

 The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and
 Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldnt put the puck over a sliding
 Ranford Later on Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom 
 played very well too Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up
 Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big Period ended scoreless but the edge
 to Sweden in creating more opportunities
 Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save Mark Recchi
 made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros Eric one timed the puck but
 Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save At the 7minute mark Canada
 started applying pressure on the Swedes SandersonDineenBrindAmour worked
 hard and kept the puck in the Swedes zone Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson
 who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman came in on Soderstrom and
 made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstroms far post 10 Canada
 The Swedes picked up their game after that and Peter Forsberg had a shot
 that hit Ranfords post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out
 Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play Jan Larsson took
 a shot from the slot Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by
 the far post passed the puck and Ranford was beat 11
 Third period started as the other periods Swedes having most of the pressure
 but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal
 At 554 Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to
 cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it
 That resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman cant cover the puck in 
 the goal crease Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he
 explained afterwards and he put it low on Soderstroms stick side close
 to the post Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal
 Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside Gartner volleyed a
 bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 31 The Swedes ran out of gas
 then and couldnt produce as good scoring chances as they had for 25 periods
 The 41 goal came with only 1 second left Rod BrindAmour scoring on a
 rebound from Soderstrom where the Swedish defense already had their minds
 in the dressing room

 A very good game the best in the WC so far with both goalies playing
 great Soderstrom best player in Sweden but Ranford even played better
 than Soderstrom that tells you something about Ranford Probably the best
 goalie in the world were some comments after the game
 Canada played a very disciplined defense Ranford pointed out that it is
 easy to play well with a good defense Lindros played A LOT and played well
 Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals

 The ForsbergNaslundBergqvist line Swedens best along with LarssonJuhlin
 Nilsson Swedish defense played well 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the
 task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros and managed this very well
 Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC and considering
 that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game he played very
 well Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game partly because
 of the Swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesmans mistake
 on the 13 goal

 The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans and the German crowd
 showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while

 I hope some Finns can provide information from this game I didnt see the
 whole game The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the
 blue line and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter
 As far as the play in the second period goes the Finns seemed to have the
 most control so a 10 lead was warranted as I saw it
