Subject ABC coverage


	I loved the ABC coverage The production was excellent The appearance
was excellent It had a sleek modern look This was the first time I heard
Thorne  Clement  I thought they were great My only request is to leave
Al Micheals out of this He annoys me 
	Im hoping this leads to a regularseason contract My guess would
be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from FebApril and then the 
playoffs I envy you Canadians with your TSN  CBC Maybe Ill get a dish
to pick up Canadian TV How much are those things BTW
