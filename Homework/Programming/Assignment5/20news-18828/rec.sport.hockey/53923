First off anyone accepted into the Western Business School is not a dork 
Second just because one person out of a country of 27 Million doesnt think
before heshe posts an article does NOT mean that heshe is embarrasing
Canada This network is for expressing what you feel are your thoughts Just
because someone doesnt agree with you this does not give you the right to
call them assholes Anyways the North Stars are SHIT
 
Cmon Leafs


Whoa there  Lighten up Andrew  When I was referring to you dorks at
the Western Business School I was specifically referring to those
assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of
Minnesota for no apparent reason  Being Canadian and one who has
friends who attended UWO I personally dont want to be associated with
the idiots who wrote those messages  One more thing Andrewuntil
this season the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen
years have they won the Cup during our lifetimeso the North Stars
havent been the only shit team in the Norris

KEA
