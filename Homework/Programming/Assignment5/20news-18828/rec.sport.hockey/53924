Subject Selfish hockey fans


	On Tuesday when it was raining in Chicago ESPN provided 
bonus hockey coverage  Now it seems as though some fans are ticked off
that the NYWash OT was replaced with the Angels game  People must
realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the US  
The baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so
they cant skip the baseball game  Why dont you people CHILL OUT
and enjoy whatever coverage you can get
