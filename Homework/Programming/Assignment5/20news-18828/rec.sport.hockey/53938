Subject Re Habs Late

Quebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept
this one from being rout although he did blow 2nd goal
Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump 
pull back most of the time

Do you notice that nobody on the team is willing to take charge
A dominant defenceman would be nicetoo bad Schneider got hurt
He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes  Speaking of Chelios I 
wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade
I also wish we still had Corson

Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the 
bench

Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation apparently  I have
no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with
Carbonneau  Savard is skating well and is one of the only dangerous
Canadiens in Quebecs zone with the puck  Too bad nobody is in front
most of the time

Do you also notice that in the defensive zone not a single Nordique
gets knocked down  Its disgusting  We also have Lebeau 510 172
getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn 63 205 with no reply
from the team except to yell for a penalty  Dammit Denis Savard 
threw the best only Montreal hit of the night when he knocked
Sundin offbalance  When Denis Savard is your teams enforcer theres
big trouble someplace

Hextall made some good saves but
really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3
 could have had 5 plus another 4 in 2nd

Aside from that second goal Roy did stand on his head  The third 
period at least provided something to look forward to  Habs won the
period IMO and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a
couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game
had started at 730  Hopefully they play that way at home  Roy made 
the saves well ignore that second goal so now its up to the team
