Subject Bruins




Come on Boston where the hell are you Seven wins in a row and what choke

Id much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs Pitt than
Buffalo or Quebec if only because it would be more interesting  Not that
Buffalo or Quebec cant put up a good fight but Id much more enjoy a 70
pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils  You have to feel for Terrerrisp

Ah well maybe the Devils will pull it out or maybe the Pens will lose in
the second round but if not I hope the Bruins are there to meet them
