   Tonight in Boston the Buffalo Sabres blanked the Boston
Bruins 40 tonight in Boston Looks like Boston can hang
this season up because Buffalos home record is awesome
This is great Buffalo fans might get to see revenge for
last year 
 
Im glad Grant Fuhr will never be as overconfident after two wins
as you areit takes four wins to defeat an opponenteach tougher
to obtain than the previous one  Buffalo is off to a good start
Fuhr is proving the Fuhrbashers wrong but Boston is an awfully
good team

Awesome home record or not you need to remember the 7th game last year at the
Aud  Id like to see some playoff games since Im stuck in Buffalo at UB but
I think Boston isnt giving up so easy
