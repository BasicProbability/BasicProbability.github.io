  Buffalo is up 20 is the series with Boston and the reasonGrant Fuhr 
  Fuhr is playoff hungry and hes proving once again why they call him
  money goaltender Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
  league anymore Statistically at least but hes proving that he can
  make the big save at the right time
  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr and probably would have had a chance 
  against powerhouse Detroit But againwhere was Andreychoke in game 1

I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr specifically because I
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series  However I dont
think the Leafs can be faulted eitherthere is nothing to say that Felix
wont be winning playoff series by himself in years to come  

I agree with Joseph  Felix Potvin is a great goalie  Besides
I thought that the Leafs could only protect goalie in the upcoming
expansion draft  If so then its better to get rid of one good
goalie and get a good forward in return
