        I do not have cable and on the nights the Caps dont 
play I would like to tune in other games  Does anyone have a 
list of the radio stations which broadcast the games for the NHL
teams

Here are the ones I can remember offhand

     KDKA    1020 AM   Pittsburgh Penguins
     WABC     770 AM   New Jersey Devils

     WJM   720 AM   Detroit Redwings
     KMOX    1120 AM   St Louis Blues
