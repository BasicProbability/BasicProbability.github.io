Just a side note squidoctopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo
I still dont understand why Buffalo but maybe its lucky    btw
they shovel them up from the ice here using the shovel used to scoop
up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice  Although Blue
did give some technical directions on its removal motioning with his
stick  



 
Valerie Hammerl 	       John Sr would lift Pat over the boards grab 
hammerlacsubuffaloedu       his hand and start running around the outside
V085PWPZUBVMSCCBUFFALOEDU  faster and faster  I wanted to learn how to 
get that feeling and the only way was to learn how to skate  P LaFontaine
