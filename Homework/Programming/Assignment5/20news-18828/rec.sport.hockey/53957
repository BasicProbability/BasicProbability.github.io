I dont know if anyone has posted a message like this yet but im
getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey
game in which the score was just tied and then cutting out and saying
sorry we cant show you this we have to show baseball tonight not
even a game a friggin HIGHLIGHT show
gee sure would have been nice to see the islescaps in overtime
I live in Pittsburgh yes im a pens fan where hockey gets a lot
of coverage  i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in Texas
must feel
