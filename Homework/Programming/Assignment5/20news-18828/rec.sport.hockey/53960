 So in other words if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
 the Penguins thats immaterial because it was the coaches decision Come on
 Joe think about what youre saying Who they played is VERY significant
 Why they played them is whats irrelevent A low GAA against good teams
 is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
 goaltenders A low GAA is better then a higher GAA A low GAA against good
 teams is much much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
 of comparing two goaltenders

Lets start over  Im not arguing about who is the better goaltender  Id
take Soderstrom right now  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a 1
netminder  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game less than
that after last night their save percentages are close and their records
are similar  And with that I just dont see how you can label Roussel as
the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season

You say Soderstrom played against better competition  That may very well
be but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in
those games  Besides against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh
the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose

 The same
 for Roussel in the Ranger game Two real scoring chances one he made a
 great play the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player If
 you were judging Roussel on that game alone you have very little to go by

But Im not just judging Roussel on that game alone  Ive seen him play
for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey  Its just
my opinion but I think hes got what it takes  Of course I thought that
about Mark LaForest too  But I never did about Wendell Young  So Im
batting 500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextallera

As for the Rangers game you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
offensive player if you like  But Rou had his leg in position to make the
save  If he didnt it wouldnt have mattered if the Rangers player didnt
get the puck up or not  It would have been a goal  On a breakaway thats
what the goalie wants to do take away as much as possible and force the
shooter to beat him

 But if you were to look at the 00 tie against the Habs you saw a goalie
 stand on his head to get that shutout THAT was a 1 goalie in action Roussel
 doesnt have a game like that in him

I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on
opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the twotime defending
champs  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was
senational in that game agains the Habs  But you cant tell me that a
Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
and just flat out missed it  Mistakes both on offense and defense are
part of the game  Or thered never be shutouts

Anyway Im happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and
Im not going to argue about it anymore  Besides with the current
7game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year I
dont want to piss you off to the point that you dont sell me any
tickets next season
