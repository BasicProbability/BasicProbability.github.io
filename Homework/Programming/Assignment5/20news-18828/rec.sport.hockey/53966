Jagr has a higher  but Francis has had more points  And take it from
an informed observer Ronnie Francis has had a much better season than
Jaromir Jagr  This is not to take anything away from Jaro who had a 
decent year although it didnt live up to the expectations of some

Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowmanstyle
player  He plays hard at all times doesnt disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time

Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude
This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time

Throughout the year Francis consistently recieved more ice time than
Jagr  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject I am pretty
sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis  When
you add to that Jagrs better  rating I think it becomes evident
that Jagr had a better season not that Francis had a bad one


  Actually what I think has become more evident is that you are determined to
  flaunt your ignorance at all cost  Jagr did not have a better season than
  Francis  to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
  hockey knowledge  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
  plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out
  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
  against the other teams top one or two lines shorthanded etc I would
  much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications
