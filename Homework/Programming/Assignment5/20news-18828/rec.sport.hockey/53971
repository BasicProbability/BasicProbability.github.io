I was watching the DetroitMinnesota game last night and thought I saw an
octopus on the ice after Ysebaert scored to tie the game at two What gives
is there some custom to throw octopuses on the ice in Detroit

It is a long standing good luck Redwings tradition to throw an octopus 
on the ice during a Stanley Cup game They say it dates back to 52
at the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team I think to sweep 
the cup in 8 games A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats
than from the old Olympia balcony though

Funniest I ever saw was when some Tiger fans threw one on the field
during a DetroitToronto baseball game   I was living in California
and the folks I was watching with had never heard of hockey and were 
incredulous when I recognized the octopus BEFORE the camera closeup
