When was the last time a Presidents Trophy winner fell to last place
the following year  A long time Id bet


Well I think it in 1969 the Montreal Canadians finished 1st although
there was no Presidents cup in those days and missed the playoffs 
in 1970 I do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasnt decided until
the final day when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings The tiebreaker was
the number of goals for if I remember correctly so the Rangers played
with an empty net for the entire game Some Hab loyalists accused 
the Wings of throwing the game to keep them out but as I recall 
Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu so coach Sid Abel sat them out
and the Rangers swarmed the RedWings most of the night
