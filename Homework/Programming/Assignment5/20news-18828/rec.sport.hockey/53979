Subject NHL team in Milwaukee


After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
Milwaukee should have an NHL team I thought Id pass along a story I heard
recently  This is second hand so I dont know how true it is but I have
no reason to doubt it either

Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team  The owner of the Admirals sorry I cant remember his name
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 50 million was too
high

Like I said I dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor but if
its true dont look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon  The Admirals
arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an NHL club
and a minor league club in the same building especially since the NBAs
Milwaukee Bucks play there as well
