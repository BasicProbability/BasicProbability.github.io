The Ranger announcement is supposed to happen tomorrow supposedly

Press conference at 1PM 

The Rangers have so many veterans that they had to get a coach with
weight and a proven recordand whom they know Messier respects

Interestingly Keenans cocoach or is it his Number One on Team
Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen  

Itd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsens
contract to be Keenans assistant   Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks
of 10 years ago  but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those
Canucks last May
