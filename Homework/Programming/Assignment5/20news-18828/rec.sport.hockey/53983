 FINLAND  
 
 DJyrki Lumme20
 DTeppo Numminen20
 DPeter Ahola13
 
Well well they dont like our defenders mainly Lumme and Numminen

 CJari Kurri25
 CChristian Ruuttu16
 
Now do YOU think that Ruuttu is only worth 16  I think it might be 20

 RTeemu Selanne27
 
Compared to Kurri Selannes points are too high lets make it 25 or 26


 well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
 Markus Ketterer the goalie 34 or the players listed above and luck Theres
 presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldnt be superstars at
 the highest level but still valuable role players however My guess would be
 that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a 500 team in the NHL

Wow now it looks like you dont like our players What about guys like
Nieminen Jutila Riihijarvi Varvio Laukkanen Makela Keskinen and even
if he is aging Ruotsalainen The main difference between finnish and North
American players is that our players tend to be better in the larger rink
The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe 
And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck though
they helped I think that the main reason was that the team worked well
together
