While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but Im not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

It was Clint Malarchuks neck cut by Uwe Krupps skate  I know it happened in
Buffalo but I cant tell you against whom

Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net

Malarchuk became the fourth goalie behind Hasek Puppa and Draper after
suffering from ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder  Hes been playing in San Diego
for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley

Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaineTurgeon trade

What do I win
