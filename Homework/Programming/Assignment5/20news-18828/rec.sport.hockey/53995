Subject Sabre fans 

Yes Yes I can see it now  all those Sabre fans FINALLY taking
their Sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them
After 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil
I guess it is a pretty good bet    BUT there has not been a team
that has come back from an 03 deficit since 1975  could this be
the year   Dont throw out the moth balls yet
