I feel the jury is still out on Tim Cheveldae as a playoff goalie
He was average in his first playoffs  Last year he had a horrible
start but played great the last ten games after he was benched
His GAA even with the horrible start was 25 last year  This year
I think hes going to play very well he has to if Detroit is going
to win the cup  He wasnt sharp in game 1 but he didnt have to be
I thought he looked pretty good yesterday

Great write up of the WingsToronto series thus far  I agree with just
about everything that you said but Chevy shouldnt have let the shot from
the right point in  First goal Mikorov I think  Other than that the
Wings are looking good and Chevy is holding his own  Not great but maybe

Chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far but they all didnt matter
However his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
big when it counts  The score was 40 I think when the goal you mentioned
was scored  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming
back Chevy was exceptional  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff
goalie  inconsistant when theres nothing on the line
but comes up big when really needed  I guess well both find out

And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set
of things to worry about  Im getting bored reading the same problems
in the paper decade after decade  I want people to have to deal
with new problems
