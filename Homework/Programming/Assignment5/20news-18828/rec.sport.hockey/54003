While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but Im not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

It was Clint Malarchuks neck cut by Uwe Krupps skate  I know it happened in
Buffalo but I cant tell you against whom

Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net

It was NOT Krupps skate  Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle
of the Blues  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk
and Tuttles skate came perilously close to cutting but actually just
missed the jugular  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice hands at
his neck blood on the ice

Malarchuk became the fourth goalie behind Hasek Puppa and Draper after
suffering from ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder  Hes been playing in San Diego
for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley

Hed been suffering from it for over a decade  He just wasnt
diagnosed for it until he didnt sleep for ten days and decided to
have some alcohol to help him sleep  Unfortunately hed just been
put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier  Its amazing he lasted as
long as he did  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between
reality and imagination or fail to accept that something theyve
checked is OK now  For example an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands
over and over and still think theyre dirty  He might check the oven
ten times to be sure its turned off  He might see a movie about
something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his
own life  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes
but still needs it  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD
episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days  He felt
it slowed his reflexes so he tried to go without  In any event he
is alive and well and living in San Diego while playing with the
Gulls IHL  


Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaineTurgeon trade

And Tuttle is no longer with the Blues but I dont know where he is
Possibly in the IHL but youd best ask a Blues fan

get that feeling and the only way was to learn how to skate  P LaFontaine
