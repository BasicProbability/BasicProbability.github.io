Yahooooooooooooooooooooo

What a game we finally beat those diquesand in OT
The Habs dominated this game and especially in OT

They finally started going to the net  See what happens when you 
create some traffic  Muller deserves full marks what a player
and Damphousse finally started skating  Roy thankyouthankyouthankyou
was excellent  Did you see that third period save on Young  And the 
defense was taking out Quebec players in the zone

Anybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds 
out that the winning goal went in off his own Dmans skate  Whatta
suck  Although he is playing really well

Life doesnt get better than this

Sure it does  On Sunday when the Bs are golfing and the Habs are tied
22 youll see what I mean
