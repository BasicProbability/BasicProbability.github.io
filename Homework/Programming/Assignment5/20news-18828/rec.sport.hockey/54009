During the first three games of the PensDevils series I have been
impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens  Jagr
MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch  But one
element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman


Bowman is in the Hockey Hall of Fame as a coach alreadyand unlike
Gil Steinhe didnt get their by stacking the Board of Directors 


While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson
Bowman in his own way has made himself a permanent though not clearly
seen mark in  Pittsburgh 

Bowman is the geniusJohnson isnt  Bowman is a great coachJohnson
a very good one  However Bowman is really not a modern coach and
Patricks solution of having him only run the team on game days and
delegate most of the daytoday responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on Patricks part
