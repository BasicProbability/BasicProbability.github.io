Im just wondering where all the Bruins fans are  I mean they woofed it
up with about 1000000 posts during the regular season saying that their
fave team was going to kick everyones  in the playoffs and win the Stanley
Oh really  I seem to remember this years woofers consisting mainly of
yourself and Roger  Boston fans were relatively quiet

Cup  While I see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving Im just
curious why all the Boston faithful have stopped posting  I mean I havent
even see just one little Boston fan post cept for the Bruins fans that
arent cocky 

I guess the concept of a fan who is not cocky is something you couldnt
possible understand eh

but I dont know Id sure like to see where all those Bruins fans are at
