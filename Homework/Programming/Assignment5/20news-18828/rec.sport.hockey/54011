Joseph shutout the Hawks 20 The Blues are playing like they did in
86  clutch n grab shoot the puck out Its incredibly boring to
watch but if it works


road I agree its very boring if youre not a Blues fan but the Blues
played two perfect road games


Not boring is right It is more likely to cause me to have a stroke
I had to listen to game two on the Blackhawk station and I dont think I
could take another call of And JOSEPH makes a SPEcTACular saaaaaave
Now Im a Blues fan but I dont want them to play like they played
in game two Sure the result was fine but the Blues match up very well
with the Hawks so they really dont need to treat them like the 86 Flames
We dont need a Monday Night Miracle to have a chance to beat Chicago
The Blues can do it on talent At least over the hawks
