Amongst Penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that Ive never
experienced before this year with the Pens The players and the fans have so
much confidence in the team this year Were savoring every game and saving
our energy for the Stanley Cup

Thats not inner calm  Its boredom and its being spoiled  The Arenas
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted  Its been seemingly forever since the team
lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory

While Im glad to have the Pens doing so well in some ways it was a better
high back when the Pens beat the Bruins two years ago and the Rangers last
year Too much of a good thing is not always good for you
