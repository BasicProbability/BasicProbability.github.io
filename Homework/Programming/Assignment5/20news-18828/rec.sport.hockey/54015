Heres one from the mill  The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton
where Porklington can get a free deal


The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere

Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantagethe provincial
government is months away from a provincial electionit is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price
and it is before the NHLs new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing

Pocklington is many thingsstupid is not one of them

He can dictate termsbecause other cities will pay his
price if Edmonton doesnt

Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport and
surrendered supremacy to Calgary and over the next few years
Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks
It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team toobecause Northlands wants
to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing

However in this case about the longterm financial
viability of the Oilers the fact is that Pocklington is basically 
right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke
the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money

Sather has done his jobthe Oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon Al Strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in Canada in a postmortem of the Oilers season in
the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me
