 While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash  
that
 Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had  
his
 jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but Im not  
positive
 Does anyone rememberknow his name

	Clint Malarchuk


  What has happened to him since

	Assigned to San Diego Gulls at the being of the season I believe

  What
 about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info

It was Uwe Krupp and a Blues player though Uwes skate I beleive cut  
Clint  He has since be traded to the Isles in the LaFontaine deal

  Has this ever
 happened before in a hockey game 

This is the only time I know of
