Subject Bleep Bruins lose 43 in OT

Bleep Bleep Bleep  The Bruins lost AGAIN in OT  I cant stand it

Aside from frustrated ravings I must give Buffalo credit they are making good 
on most of their scoring opportunities and are playing great defense  Boston
players cant seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net
except for on rare occasions  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent
job clearing away rebounds  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed
but hes also getting plenty of help
Boston has been playing rather well better than would be indicated by the 
series score of 30 but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the 
game  As a result Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period
2 goals down  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single
game the outlook for the Bruins advancement to the second round are quite
bleak  IMHO the Bruins NEED to score first  If they can do that they have
an excellent chance of winning since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 
2nd and 3rd periods

The scary thing is that Ill be going to grad school in Buffalo next year
   Ill never cheer for the Sabres You cant convert me
