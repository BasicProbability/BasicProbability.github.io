McGillHammond  Johan Garpenlov  Would you really rather have those two
instead of Johan

	By your logic then you enjoy having Falloon and Ozolinsh on 
	injured reserve


Falloon was hurt on a clean check  He just fell poorly  Same with Wilson
I dont know about Ozolinsh  A judo coach would do more for the Sharks 
injury situation than Bob Probert

Actually a judojujitsu coach could help add a really interesting 
wrinkle to anyones game
