The Fat Lady is about to hit the first noteOkayhow about 30 deficits
The Bs chances for a comeback are now less 1Thats based on 7game
playoff format

Actually thats based on the NHLs history of 7 games  The statstical
odds of winning one straight game  5050  Two straight games  25  Three
straight games  125 4 straight games  625  The odds of the Penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 00061  Of course this doesnt
include weighted average but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight a weaker
team along with beating the Rangers 3 straight a much stronger team has made
the act balanced out  Thats about right  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10 with weighted average since Buffalos record isnt as
good and Boston has a stronger team  Enough about my QBA probabilities though
Its just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE if you integrate that to Debbie
Gibson 

   Who do you think gets the start in game three I hope it is going
to be Blue If the team can rally around him maybe Moog can too

Moog gets about s out of 5 for his performance from me  I give Blue 4
starts  Fuhr has been too tough  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in
timeI mean after all Buffalo is 3 wins 7 losses in their last 10

Harry Sindens appearance outside of Bs dressing room after Game 3
was a pathetic site He said something really retarded to cover Sutters
behindThis game is not about winning or losing Harrycheck the

Its very frustrating to lose and youve gotta say something  Actually
its not about winning or losing it is how you play the game  But when the
competition is magnified to this level 999 of the people only care about
who wins or loses 

schedule Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer
vacation on Sunday morning

I think Buffalo will win in 6  its not like Boston is getting blown away
They lost 2 OT games  with a different bounce they could easily be up 21

Harry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up
in a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the
businessBrian Sutter Sutters playoff record as the head coach in StLouis
speaks for itself The Blues really have a chance to advance to the
second round this year

Good point here  Chicagos in deep trouble tonight  The Hawks have a bad
past history of winning the division and losing early  When they dont finish
1st they do okay
