even see just one little Boston fan post cept for the Bruins fans that
arent cocky 

I guess the concept of a fan who is not cocky is something you couldnt
possible understand eh

My sig has nothing to do with cockiness  What you put in your sig has nothing
to do with your article as I learned back in the fall the hard way

Nah  I doubt you really would  Youre just being a PROVOCATIVE SOB
as usual with a large stick up your but  Of course I mean that in the

You mean butt dont you  Not but 

nicest way  

Sure you do  what

And just how much bragging did YOU do wobbie on rsbc after
UMASS beat your Quakers

Two points one what does rsbc have to do with hockey  Secondly UMASS
beat my Quakers  Hello  Earth here are you responding  Were not in
the Atlantic 10 or 8 whatever you wanna call it were in the Big 10 now
The A10 was too weak for my Lady Lions  they had to go to a more challenging
conference  It didnt pay off as the Big East showed them a thing or too but
I still posted on a regular basis and tracked all the womens scores with
reviews throughout the tournament  It wasnt a reason to stop posting 

BTW  Congratulations should go to the Sabres  They are playing more

Its not over yet  if anyone has a chance to come back in 4 games I think
Boston can do it but I still see Buffalo winning in 6

diciplined and with more will to win  They deserve it

Agreed  theyre playing tremendous hockey right now  Congatualtions on three
straight Buffalo  It could very easily be 21 Boston but Buffalo has come up
tough and a little luck  You never see a penalty in OT that doesnt have both
sides involved in a playoff game  Never never never
