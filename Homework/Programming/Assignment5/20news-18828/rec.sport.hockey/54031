Subject Ghost from Sweeneys past


Wow this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team Boston
Which Sweeney you askwell of course Bob Sweeney the one that Boston
let Buffalo get a hold of they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things
slightly confusing  Game winner in OT in game 1 and another
BIG goal seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves  this is why
Grant has 5 rings to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd  Yes Neely countered
a minute later but hadnt this course of Buffalo going ahead after being
tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities I
think Boston would have notched their first win of the series

Well the Sabres havent made it to the end of this series yet but
I certainly feel theyve got Boston right were they want themactually
theyve got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt
that would come about  One more astronomical game by Fuhr a few more
heroics by the rest of the team this is a team sport afterall and I
think Borque Neely Jouneau sp and Company are gonna be swinging
a new stick Weather is perfect for golf season real soon  Im not
gonna waiger anything on this because Ive seen some really strange
things happen in both pro and college hockey

Talking about golfwas that a hockey swing golf swing or baseball
swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev
deflected in for the BIG ONE  The whole OT all 1 minute of it was a
tesiment to Buffalos ability to really be persistent and grind it out
in the end something they werent necessarily in the regular season  The
Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in
the opening seconds  I dont normally like penalties being called in
such ultracritical points but this was BLATENT  Finally the Sabres
won a faceoff they werent that hot in this dept the rest of the game
when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times  When Hawerchuck took his
shot quite a boomer but Blue stopped this one he took a few steps
over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again without setting
it up  I didnt realize it went in until the announcer started screaming
They score THEY SCORE  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping
up and down skating a little bit jumping some more and then skating
over to Brad May who he jumped on
