 and Ill give Fuhrs new one an honourable mention although I havent
seen it closely yet it looked good from a distance  

This is the new Buffalo one the second since hes been with the
Sabres  I recall a price tag of over 700 just for the paint job on
that mask and a total price of almost 1500  Ouch  

Yeah its the second one  And I believe that price too  Ive been trying
to get a good look at it on the BruinSabre telecasts and wow does it ever
look good  Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing  And given
Fuhrs play since he got it I bet the Bruins are wishing he didnt have it
