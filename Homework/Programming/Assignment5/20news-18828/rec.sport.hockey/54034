While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but Im not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

Thanks

    I remember reading an article in Readers digest many moons ago
 about a similar incident During a minor leaque game a player neck was
 cut when the opponent he was backchecking tripped and his skakes
 flew up In this case the victims mask proved a hinderance since
 his face was protected and so he didnt bother with the
 usually instinctive reaction to protect his faceneck A quick        
 thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
 snow to contract the blood vessels from what I can remember
