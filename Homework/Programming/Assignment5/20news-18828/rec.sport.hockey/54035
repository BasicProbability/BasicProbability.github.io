Subject Re Hockey guest spots

Hi guys
        Im looking to answe a bit of trivia  What hockeplayers have
appeared on major talk shows on TV ie Letterman CarsonLeno
Arsenio etcie shows of a national natureinclude Canadian equivalents
if you can think of any  This can include NHL Olympic and World Champion
ship players  Im pretty sure Ive seen Gretzky and Lemieux but I was
wondering if there were any others

I saw Messier and Leetch shooting at a camera on Letterman  I
could have been any show though since I watch NONE of those late
night shows very regularly
