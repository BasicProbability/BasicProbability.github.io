The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year  I had the Rangers
on MSG and the two different games on SCNY and SCA on at the same time  Yes
Id rather have SC cover it just for the amount of coverage

So this year you had a game on SCNY a game on SCA a game on ESPN
and if the Rangers hadnt crashed and burned you would have had a
game on MSG  What are you complaining about

I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage  I
even remember Orioles games being shown in the DC area instead of
hockey  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other
games because its feature game was over  Sound familiar

This year Im getting twice the coverage  I can see all the Caps
games plus the games ESPN shows  I think its great that hockey is
back on ESPN  IMHO theyre doing a great job especially considering
the baseball contract they have to work around
