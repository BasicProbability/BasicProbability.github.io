Felix Potvin deserves to have the sh kicked out of him  If there is anyone
that he should be hitting with his stick its his pussy defensemen who cant
seem to move big Dino Ciccerelli 510 180 lbs out from in front of the net

Obviously Toronto has realized that they are overmatched by the Wings and must
rely on trying to antagonize the superior Red Wings with cheap shots  I prefer
to watch hockey than seeing shots of Felix Potvin slashing and spearing Dino
Ciccerelli standing in front of the net  HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO STAND IN
FRONT OF THE NET JUST NOT IN THE CREASE

Yes he does  BUT the goalie sure as hell doesnt want him there  When
I played roller hockey boy do I miss those days as a goalie I would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot  I dont care if hes
in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball
Yes roller hockey remember  And if there was nobody around to clear
the slot then Id do it myself by pushing the offending playerhard 
I hate people in my way when Im the goalie and I am sure Felix does
too  I should say that I didnt see the incident so if Potvin really
swung the stick big time then thats not right but he can move people
out of the way  Hes a player on the ice too you know
