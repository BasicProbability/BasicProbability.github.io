 Thats not inner calm  Its boredom and its being spoiled  The Arenas
 been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
 take winning for granted  Its been seemingly forever since the team
 lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and
 surprise at victory

At least last night there was some excitement The Pens 
didnt have it wrapped up before the game was half over like 
the previous two games Im not sure if NJ just rose up and 
played better or if the Penguins just started to play down 
somewhat Probably it was somewhere in between New Jersey 
seemed much more aggressive last night in the Pens end They 
did much more swarming around which at least kept an 
element of suspense in the game No question that Billington 
helped make it more interesting also Claude Lemieux didnt 
help the cause any though with his ejection early in the 
game So whos going to start in the Devils goal for the 
final game Sunday  Sorry I couldnt help myself
