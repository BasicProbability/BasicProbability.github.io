Subject Hockey Equip Recommendations

Hey man 

Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a
couple of sessions of mock hockey Im ready to invest in hockey
equipment particularly since I will be taking summer hockey
lessons  However I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it
comes to hockey equipment  Ive checked out local stores and looked
at catalogs but I was hoping to solicit opinionssuggestions before
actually plunking down any money  Having played football in high
school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for
comparison  But for example what are the advantagesdisadvantages to
different kinds of shoulder pads and pantsgirdles  Are there any
notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles  etc  So any suggestions
or comments would be greatly appreciated
