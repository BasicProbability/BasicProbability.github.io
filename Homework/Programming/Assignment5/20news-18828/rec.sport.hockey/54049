The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year
Yes Id rather have SC cover it just for the amount of coverage

So this year you had a game on SCNY a game on SCA a game on ESPN
and if the Rangers hadnt crashed and burned you would have had a
game on MSG  What are you complaining about

The problem is that by no fault of ESPN ongoing games are not
covered til the final horn sounds  With two channels SCNY and SCA
latefinishing games up to Pacific time and overtimes elsewhere will
kick in at the end of local coverage  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets
there is still some hockey on SCA SCNY Plus

With an ESPN 2 the current situation would be alleviated
