	I said Gund will have to open his CHECKBOOK I didnt say give up
	any draft picks or promising talent  If we could have gotten
	Murphy for the 2M great but I agree the Sharks shouldnt give
	up young talent or early round draft picks  I listed Chelios et al
	only to indicate the TYPE of player I think the Sharks need to pick 
	up  The rules on signing free agents less than 30 years old puts
	a big restriction on what the Sharks can pick up  However I do
	believer they need to pick up some players who will add toughness
	to the team

But you have to remember that youre unlikely to get any real quality free
agents who do not require compensation  The Sharks tried with Makarov who
was probably the top of the class among noncompensation free agents but even
he probably wouldnt have helped too much

	Dont expect to get top quality just some toughness  I dont
	view Makarov as a player who would add toughness

Size hopefully wont be much of a worry next year  Alexander Cherbayev and
Michal Sykora have agreed to multiyear contracts and it appears that Mike
Rathje will also sign soon  All three are pretty big

	Size alone isnt enough  We all know how much fear Kolstad 66
	struck in the eyes of opponents NOT

Well Rathje and Sykora are both highly touted prospects unlike Kolstad
And Cherbayev was initially supposed to play for the Russian WC Team  Anybody
know what happened there  That means that hes likely to be good enough


	Nelson youre confusing skill and toughness


McGillHammond  Johan Garpenlov  Would you really rather have those two
instead of Johan

	By your logic then you enjoy having Falloon and Ozolinsh on 
	injured reserve

By your logic then you think that if the Sharks had kept McGill and Hammond
that you can guarantee that Falloon and Ozolinsh wouldnt have gotten hurt
Think again there was a chance that McGill would have caused Ozolinsh to get
stuck at KC and as you know Hammond is worthless and McGill is almost
worthless

Well Wilson maybe but I dont think Falloon and Ozolinsh were really
injured on cheapshots

	who said they were   

If they werent then I dont see any justification that having McGill and
Hammond around would prevent their injuries  If the injuries of Falloon and
Ozolinsh were purely accidental then what could McGill and Hammond have done
to prevent them

	Hey get off the McGillHammond thing  Im no fan of either My
	point is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missing
	this year  This year we had more skill Im all for that but
	if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they
	cant do you much good  Whether its a cheap shot or not you
	cant let the other teams push you around  The 199293 Sharks
	simply got pushed around to much  Other teams knew this
	They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and not
	pay for it   Adding some players in the off season who will
	add some toughness to the team will help insure that next
	season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously 
	check our skill players or to take cheap shots  It doesnt
	guarantee no injuries nothing does but its something the
	Sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries  

	mark

 just say
