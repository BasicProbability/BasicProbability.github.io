 I was watching the DetroitMinnesota game last night and thought I saw an
 octopus on the ice after Ysebaert scored to tie the game at two What gives
 
 No no no  Its a squid  Keep the tradition alive  Kinda like the
 fish at UNH games
 
Actually the way I understand it it is an octapus
Apparently a number of years ago a fan threw an octapus on
the ice and the announcer said Octapi will not occupy the ice
or something like that and its happened ever since  The fans
cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands and
boo those who use a shovel
