Unfortunately Roger is now over at rsbaseball spewing his expertise
ie being a dickhead  I guess he is afraid of posting anything

 Hey we could start a new game on the net  Its called Wheres Roger
Its similiar to Wheres Waldo but instead of finding Waldo in a picture
of people we try to find Roger in a newsgroup on the net
 I predict that hell be in rsbasketballpro next
