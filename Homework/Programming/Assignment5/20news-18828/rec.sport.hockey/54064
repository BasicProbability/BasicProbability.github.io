I for one am happy about the Rangers hiring of Keenan  Its too bad that they


I agree that Keenan is an excellent choice  Did you see Mike
Lupicas column in Sundays news  My sentiments exactly  I
think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire
into their hearts next season  Either that or hes going to 
be kicking alot of butt

Reading through most of these hockey news I dont see many Ranger fans writing   

Im here but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly
quiet you know doing the lurking thing  I dont have a
sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either  I 
am a diehard Ranger fan I guess I have to be  I sat in the
Garden throughout the Penguins  led by Marios 5 goals  decimation 
of them on 49 but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
been totally untapped and the lack of heart displayed this
season


I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last
dreadful stretch

1 Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we see Mike
Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first went
down


Hurlbut was injured for quite a while  Im not sure but I
think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run and
if so like you question why he wasnt used


2 Why is Joe Kocur playing every night  He is not Bob Probert who is
tough but also can play


I believe Kocur was used in many instances for his intimidation 
factor  Granted he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for 
that reason alone but you have to realize that when a team is
not doing any REAL physical intimidation Id like to have a nickel 
for every time JD said Theyve got to take the body more 
youve got to at least have some illusions 

3 How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the
season  At least he plays with some heart and character draws penalties and
plays 110 when hes on the ice  Was he in the doghouse for some reason

I agree and I dont know

4 Joe Cirella  Enough said


Sorry I dont agree with you here  I think Joey C did a good
job filling in when he was asked to  I cant imagine that its
easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer  I dont
seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
much or failing to clear the zone  He worked hard and at
least didnt make any rookie mistakes  As he said himself in an
interview he can only give what he has  and he did  


Ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike Islander
fans who only show up when the team wins


Absolutely  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the
last day of the season than any average night for the
Islanders

 
fought series  Mario is amazing


The man is awesome  In a way Im enjoying the playoffs more
now that the Rangers arent in them  I can really appreciate
all the glory Mario is getting without hating him because hes
on the opposing team  He deserves it all as far as Im
concerned
