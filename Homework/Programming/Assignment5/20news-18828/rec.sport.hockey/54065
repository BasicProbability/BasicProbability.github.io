    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules  Overtime time games
    that are not shown  What the hell kind of shit is this  If that would
    have happened to the Flyersif they were in the damn playoffs to begin
    with while I was watching I would have gone throught the roof

For those of you who read TV Guide theres an article in next weeks
SPORTSVIEW concerning the NHL and major network broadcasting Pretty
interesting
