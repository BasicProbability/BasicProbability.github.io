Clement although he has a pleasant personality aggravatingly pleasant
in my opinion is a terrible
analyst because he is almost alway wrongthe prototypical example
being New Jerseys first goal last Sunday
 
I grew up with Dick Irvin doing color beside Danny GallivanI knew
did Irvin Dick Irvin was a friend of mineBill Clement you arent
any Dick Irvin
 
As long as the teams involved do not include the US national team or
the New York Rangers Id take John Davidson over Bill Clement any
day

Personality means something to me  That is exactly why I like Clement
and Emrick  On the other hand JD is a pompous bullheaded arrogant
knowitall  Hes a real turnoff which is exactly what I do when hes
on  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks
too much  If I wanted that Id listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball
game
