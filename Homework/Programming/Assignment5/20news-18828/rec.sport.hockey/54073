Subject German audience is lunatic

I watched the game GermanyCzechs in WC todayand i was astonished about
the behaviour of the German audience
The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went
grazy They threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis
that stupid or what I guess the Canadian referee one of the
Isostarbros  gave the German team a penalty for that but it didnt help
much
I guess the Germans just are proud over their NaziKillemAllEveryone
ButUsGermansSucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude
in every possible sport remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer
It really pisses me off
I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks but 
most of them seem to do
