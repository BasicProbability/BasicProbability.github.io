The score is now 60 The Pens are beating the shit out of the Devils who
gave up in the middle of the 2nd period ESPN does something smart The
announcer states well folks this game is getting out of hand Lets go to
the IslanderCapitals game I celebrate as I was actually making progress in
my CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game  I tear down and
throw on my jersey Hunter scores I go ape shit cause this is the first
caps game Ive been able to watch all season And what does ESPN do they
go back to the blowout that NJ hasnt a chance in hell of winning
     The period ends and the sportscaster CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP YES
oops excuse me  goes into his penguin worship mode Dont freak pens fans
They are worthy of this Im so glad we wont have to play them as much next
year and here comes the 3rd periodwhat its the blowout again Oh they
were just waiting for the CapIsles to get out of intermission Good
theyve put a close game back on Wait WHATS THIS SHIT THEYRE SHOWING
THE BLOWOUT AGAIN


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

Oh guess what the score is now 70 penguins Switch games you 

Holy shit theyre changing games ITS ABOUT GODDAMNED TIME Lets see if
theyll stay

Later

I think this proves by  point The Caps game goes into overtime but
due to contractual obligations they have to switch to the fucking baseball
Sorry for my language but im PISSED What the hell were they going to do
if their scheduled game went into overtime ESPN get your head out of your
ass

Now I know there are a lot 



 First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job but
 last night I felt the same way I really hate watching DevilsPens game 
 Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked why even 
 bother showing them I was so bored and these ESPN people dont seem to have
 any brain After the Sundays and last night games they are still going to 
 show DevilsPens on THU and SUN WHat the hell are they thinking about I 
 think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract
 Id rather see CapsIsls game which is more exciting 

 Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast
 we can get diffrent hockey games
