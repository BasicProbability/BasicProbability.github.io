	I loved the ABC coverage The production was excellent The appearance
Antonioyou werent alone

ABC ratings were very good I was schocked to hear that ABCs telecast
was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend National
rating came out to a very respectable 33 Top29 Nielsen markets were
at 29 In Bostonthe game scored lower at 24 but it had some competion
from local sports teams
Quite frankly I expected ABCs ratings to be under 20 But Im happy
to be proven wrong

WellwellSometimes it pays off clicking away on your cabletv remote
control And if you happen to be a hockey fanyou could just stumble
upon a playoff hockey game

ESPN picked up DetroitToronto game on Monday night because the only
night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago You have to give
ESPN credit for switching to Detroits FOX50 coverage and having Bill
Clement at a Pittsburghs TV stationWATE for intermission analysis
MaybeESPN people were giddy over perliminary overnight ABC ratings
for Sundays telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the
Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion
Good moveESPN
