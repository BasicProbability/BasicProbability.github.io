Subject Re ESPN UP YOURS 


Various justifiable rantings on ESPN coverage by several deleted


The only way to change ESPNs thinking if it is even possible is to complain
to them directly  Anyone know there telephone  in Bristol Ct  

I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesnt think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring gameI know I did  And then when
they didnt show the NYIWash overtimes I was livid  If I wanted
to watch baseball I could have turned on the PhilliesPadres extra
inning gameinstead I went to bed angryI boycotted ESPNs
morning Sportscenter today I was still so incensed

My wife says I shouldnt go to bed angry but last niteGRRRRRRR
