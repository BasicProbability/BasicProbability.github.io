J What a game we finally beat those diquesand in OT
J The Habs dominated this game and especially in OT

You realize that we dominated game 1 also and should be ahead in this 
series 2  1

J Glorieux were plagued by bad luck the puck wouldnt bounce their
J way  But in OT they got their lucky break the winning goal
J went off Gusarovs skate  Thank you Lord

And its about time We hit 2 posts in this overtime and 1 post in 
game 1s overtime Lets hope that we start getting some luck for 
a change

He played well in this game but Roys inconsistency still makes me 
nervous Otherwise Id say were going to win this series no sweat 
Its all up to Patrick Roy to provide consistent goaltending

J And those damn Bruins lost in OT their down 30  Congratulations
J Buffalo

J Life doesnt get better than this
