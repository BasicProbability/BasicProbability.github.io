   Tonight in Boston the Buffalo Sabres blanked the Boston
Bruins 40 tonight in Boston Looks like Boston can hang
this season up because Buffalos home record is awesome
This is great Buffalo fans might get to see revenge for
last year 

Im glad Grant Fuhr will never be as overconfident after two wins
as you areit takes four wins to defeat an opponenteach tougher
to obtain than the previous one  Buffalo is off to a good start
Fuhr is proving the Fuhrbashers wrong but Boston is an awfully
good team
