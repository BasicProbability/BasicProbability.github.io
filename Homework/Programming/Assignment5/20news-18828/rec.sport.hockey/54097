I dont think trading Kisio was intrinsically a mistake however trading him
for a 3rd round pick would be he should have been worth a lot more than a
3rd round pick for a playoff team  In fact I would intimate that the offers
the Sharks got this year for Kisio were way greater than just a 3rd round pick

Hindsights 2020 Nobody expected Kisio to have his 2nd best career year

Besides without Kisio the Sharks would have tanked even earlier in
the season and Gund might have gotten a little more serious
about getting Joe Murphy a guy who definitely would be around
3  5 years from now when the Sharks do make the playoffs

What else could be done  The Gunds offered 2 million for Murphy but the
Oilers wanted prospects which the Sharks declined to give which I think is
correct

I didnt mean to imply that Gunds offer wasnt enough  Gunds offer
was the right  but too late in the season  2M offered in November
lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy this season and make the
playoffs this year 2M in March doesnt help Sather with his
immediate objectives doesnt help with long term objectives only a
prospect or draft pick does and no way should the Sharks do that
However getting back to whatif games had Kisio been traded to
Chicago last year then the Sharks go 0 for October and maybe Gund
panicks sooner in November And heres another whatif twist Chicago
would have had Kisio this season they never go after Murphy in the
first place because Kelly is having his best season bigger guys in
Chicago So Gund has no competition So Ferriera Sather and Keenan
all look like geniuses

A broken fax machine and Ferriera Keenan and maybe Kingston
and maybe even Green lose their jobs Kind of makes you
shiver doesnt it 

Bottomline for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
Kisio leaving I can concoct an equally bright one

If the Kisiofiasco was the cause of Ferierras down fall I hope
it wasnt because he tried to trade Kisio but because he screwed it
up Nonetheless Im sorry Ferierra and Kingston are gone and I wish Gund
would follow

And what have the Gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were
gone 

Are you serious
	 Let Ferierra go
	 fire Kingston these last two basically mean that
		Sharks are starting over again in terms of the
		timetable to capture the Cup As Ive stated
		frequently 5 out 6 expansion teams had the same GM
		from inception through Cup season

	 broadcast more home games than away games
	 broadcast very few road Pacific and Mountain time games
	 jack up my ticket prices from 27 to 38 in two years not that Im
		going to pay 120 bucks for 3 seats Ill probably next to the
		virtual 107 folks

	 not tell me my priority 
	 not let me sell my priority 
	 in order for me to get the free jacket force me to order my tickets
		for next season before I get to select my section

	 not let me park at the new arena after paying for their
		privileged parking lot which was sometimes full when
		I got there for 2 straight years

Ive been a loyal ticket holder since day 1 literally in spring of
90 when the team was announced  and Im not getting that loyalty
returned Wirtz treats his fans far better by comparison And
Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all

GO EDMONTON OILERS  Go for playoffs next year  Stay in Edmonton

I know one isnt suppose to make negative comments on signatures but
what did us Oiler fans do to you to deserve the Stay in Edmonton
part Id never wish the Kings to leave metroLA its too much fun
watching the Sharks beat them
 
Mike Eisler mreEngSunCom  Not only are they Leafs the best team but
 their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburghs  Their
 players are mighty bright too  I mean he really was going to get his
 wallet back right Jan Brittenson 393 on LeafPen woofers in
