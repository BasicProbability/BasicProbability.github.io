Heres one from the mill  The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton
where Porklington can get a free deal

Given what Labour relations and Puck has been like it WOULD be a sigh of 
relief

This WAY w4e can can BOTH elements

Well Dave I would have to disagree with you there  Satan himself could
own the team and Id be happy as long as the Oilers stayed in Edmonton
Selfish but true  I dont want to see the Oilers move no matter who
their owner is
