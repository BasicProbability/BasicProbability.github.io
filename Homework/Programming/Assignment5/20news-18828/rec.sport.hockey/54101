While watching the PenguinsDevils game last night I saw the slash that
Barrasso took on the neck  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate  I think he was a Sabre but Im not positive
Does anyone rememberknow his name  What has happened to him since  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie  Name  Info  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game   

Thanks
