Subject Re Don Cherry  help me out here

In article MfpIRbO00WBLI1ispCandrewcmuedu William K Willis ww1aandrewcmuedu writes

     As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesnt know
anything about him I dont know whether it is just this area
Pittsburgh of the USA that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether
hes a Canadian thing altogether  Seriously what is he all about  I
know he was a coach at one time and from the volume of posts about him
SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow but my question
is what is the deal with him  Secondly are the comments of his that I
read about on the net merely flame bait or do people actually take him
seriously  I gotta tell you from what I see he really sounds like an
ass  Let me know  maybe Im missing something


For those of you who complain about Don Cherry and wonder why he is
popular

the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and
Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his AllMadden team
a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons Cherry
sings the praises of Doug Gilmoura little guy with heartyet one
doesnt see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
lost his marbles

Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
that college with outrageous statements

Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters
in relation to our greatest passionwhich is hockey   Canadians
are very similar to Americansculturally our sports are just hockey
and curling whereas with Americans it is footballbasketballbaseball
and bowling
