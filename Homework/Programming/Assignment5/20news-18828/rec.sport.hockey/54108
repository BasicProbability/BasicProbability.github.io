 That more or less says it  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw
 Ulf crosscheck Valeri in the face  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to
 go off on this at all in coachs corner

And that was the ONLY infraction of this type in the game 
Come on Wake up Geez Hes not the only player who does this
sort of thing I think we were kind of lucky The game was not
really all that chippy considering the state NJ is in about
now
