There have been to many fn complainers about this game that its making me
sick

Generally I agree with you However 1 last night ESPN cut away to Baseball
Tonite which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball and they cut
away at 740 pacific Thats quite a contract they have there 2 if
ESPN couldnt deliver they should have had a transistion plan to
let SportsChannel pick up the slack

Nonetheless it is ultimately the fault of the USAmerican public that regular
season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the US
Support your team support your game

Somebody in rsh had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler
to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would
consider their products Heres an equally excellent idea watch
baseball for 10 minutes I know Im asking a lot but thats what spew
bags are for write down who is advertising and write them letters
complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and
that you wont consider buying their products because of it
 
Mike Eisler mreEngSunCom  Not only are they Leafs the best team but
 their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburghs  Their
 players are mighty bright too  I mean he really was going to get his
 wallet back right Jan Brittenson 393 on LeafPen woofers in
