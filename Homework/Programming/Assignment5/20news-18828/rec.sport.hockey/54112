Subject Bernie Nicholls  What a man

Just some thoughts

I dont usually like to post simply to make fun of a player
but this time I couldnt resist  During the PensDevils game
last night second period I think Kevin Stevens was in the
penalty box Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face
then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend
himself  All Kjell could do at 87 and 355 pounds was laugh

And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen Ulf is getting a
little out of hand lately  His cheap shots are getting more
frequent and more violent  As everybody in the Meadowlands
except for the officials could see last night he rammed the
butt of his stick down one of the Devils throat  Ive always
supported the argument he does his job by being irritating
but hes starting to push it over the edge IMHO  Of course
Holiks chop to Barrassos neck wasnt too sportsmanlike either
It seems that he was following the The only way to beat the
Penguins is to injure them philosophy

As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day
Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night and last night as
well although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end
was pretty exciting
