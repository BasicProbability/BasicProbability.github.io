I fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team
left in Pittsburgh will be the Steelers

Perish the thoughtbut you know you may be right at least as far
as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go  They all seem to be
becoming BIG MONEY games much more so than at any previous time  To
think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now
all that may be there is an AHL team at bestSIGH

The interesting thing is that the NHL is also expanding at the same
time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to
operate a team  This would seem to indicate that theres a BIG
shakeout about to occur in the next few years unless player salaries
can somehow be brought under control  Frankly I dont see how the
NHLs current drive for expansion is supportable under its current
operating conditions  If revenue sharing AND a salary cap dont come
into the NHL soon look out
