 In fact the tradition has been passed down to their affiliate
 in Adirondack In Gm 6 of last yrs finals an 8 legged creature was
 hurled onto the frozen pond and landed right at the feet of ref
 Lance Roberts

 It may have been passed to Toronto but Ive even seen an octopus at
 the Aud  last years BruinsSabres game  I knew all about the
 Detroit version but seeing at the Aud was a bit puzzling  

I dont think its puzzling a bit Its called unoriginality

no im not bitter
