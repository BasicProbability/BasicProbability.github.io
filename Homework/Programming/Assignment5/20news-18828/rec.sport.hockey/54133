Subject Grant Fuhr leads Sabres

  Buffalo is up 20 is the series with Boston and the reasonGrant Fuhr 
  Fuhr is playoff hungry and hes proving once again why they call him
  money goaltender Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
  league anymore Statistically at least but hes proving that he can
  make the big save at the right time
  
  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr and probably would have had a chance 
  against powerhouse Detroit But againwhere was Andreychoke in game 1 

  I can see the huge smile on Geralds face after Fuhrs performance
