Hooray I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game Selanne
getting a hattrick

Of course here in GODS COUNTRY read Ontario I couldnt
see that game nor any other in the VANWPG series so far
because our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about
this series which has looked pretty competitve so far

On Monday and Wednesday nights CBC could have shown the Toronto
Detroit game done the news then picked up WinnipegVancouver
They didnt  Tonight  You guessed it TorontoDetroit the
news not the end of the Jets game then CalgaryLA

SO if its Hockey Night in Canada why cant this Ontarian see
one of the two series with two Canadian teams  Is this too much to
ask
