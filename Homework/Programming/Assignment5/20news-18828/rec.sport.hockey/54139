Teemu Selanne had 3 goals Keith Tkachuk had one and Luciano Borsato
scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the
Canucks 54 and close the series to 21  Trevor Linden and Pavel
Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause

Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump scoring two powerplay
goals and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon

Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets and if the Jets continue to
exhibit this strong work effort they can make a series of it I woofed
last year when we were up 31I aint going to do THAT again  Ill
have to be quietly happy with a solid performance
