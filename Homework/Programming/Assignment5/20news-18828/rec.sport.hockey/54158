According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN should the Islanders win tonite
the two teams will have the same record but the Devils will be playing the

the Devils  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include

1  season series
2  goals against
3  goals for

in this order correct me if Im wrong  Anyone have anything to add


I thought it was 1 wins 2 goals for
