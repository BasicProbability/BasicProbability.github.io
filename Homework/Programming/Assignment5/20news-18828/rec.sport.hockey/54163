From cdashmoetcscoloradoedu Charles Shub
Subject ESPN really sucks big time


so all us hockeyautomobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand
	ESPN delays the martinsville race by a day for the NFL draft
	ESPN shows baseball instead of the overtime of a NHL playoff game

	gimme a break guys

  Does anyone know why this race is tape delay Especially until Monday
  Is this the weekend for the NFL draft
  If so postponing the race for a day is
  a real slap in the face for racing fans
  Im afraid youre right as usual As I recall theyve been doing this
  ever since they started covering the draft live I wish they could work
  out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as TNN to get the race
  on live but I guess ESPN isnt much into sharing It also clarifies
  where auto racing stands on their priority list as if we didnt already
  know
