Well well they dont like our defenders mainly Lumme and Numminen

About 25 is correct for Numminen and Lumme


 RTeemu Selanne27
 
Compared to Kurri Selannes points are too high lets make it 25 or 26

No Kurris points are too low 27 for Kurri and 28 for Selnne

 well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
 Markus Ketterer the goalie 34 or the players listed above and luck Theres
 presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldnt be superstars at
 the highest level but still valuable role players however My guess would be
 that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a 500 team in the NHL

Wow now it looks like you dont like our players What about guys like
Nieminen Jutila Riihijarvi Varvio Laukkanen Makela Keskinen and even
if he is aging Ruotsalainen The main difference between finnish and North
American players is that our players tend to be better in the larger rink
The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe 
And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck though
they helped I think that the main reason was that the team worked well
together


Thats true Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL Northame
ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks An average
european player from Sweden Finland Russian or TsechSlovakia is a better 
skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague Especially defenders in NHL
are mainly slow and clumsy Selnne has also said that in the Finnish Smleague
game is more based on skill than in NHL In Finland he couldnt get so many 
breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
NHL Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Selnnes speed accentuates because
of clumsy defensemen

I have to admit that the best players come from Canada but those regulars
arent as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues Also top europeans
are in the same level as the best northamericansexcept Lemieux is in the
class of his own
