Interestingly Keenans cocoach or is it his Number One on Team
Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen  


But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day
Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the
initiative within the limits of his systemwhile Roger
has a reactive hockey philosophywhich is why Messier will
be able to and has played for Keenan but thought Rogers way
was a sure loser

Itd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsens
contract to be Keenans assistant   Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks
of 10 years ago  but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those
Canucks last May 


Roger is a great assistant coachbut considering what must be bad
blood between Nielson and Messier it would be a mistake to bring
him back even in that role
