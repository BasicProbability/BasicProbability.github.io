 I watched the game GermanyCzechs in WC todayand i was astonished about
 the behaviour of the German audience
 The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went

It was not just those penalties Most of all it was the penalty the referee didnt
call on the Czechs right before their first goal

 grazy They threw coins extra pucks and other trash into the rinkis
 that stupid or what I guess the Canadian referee one of the
 Isostarbros  gave the German team a penalty for that but it didnt help
 much
 I guess the Germans just are proud over their NaziKillemAllEveryone

Dont you think its quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude when some people 
throw coins on the ice Hey I dont approve the behavior of these guys
especially not in a WC game but I cant see any reason for using the word Nazi
in this connection 
  
 ButUsGermansSucks attitudethey just seem to have that kind of attitude
 in every possible sport remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer

Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem remember the world cup in Italy
Again theres a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shopwindows
or fighting with other socalled fans who come to a WC just to see if the
Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers
Which other sports are you talking about I dont think soccer is every possible
sport

 It really pisses me off
 I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks but 
 most of them seem to do

How many Germans do you know Do you think 200 out of 10000 is most of them 
If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US what do you
think about the Americans Most of them like beating blacks
