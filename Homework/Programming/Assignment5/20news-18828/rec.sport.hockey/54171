 Id like to see some playoff games since Im stuck in Buffalo at UB but
I think Boston isnt giving up so easy

No Boston probably wont go down easy but if the Sabres hadnt won
game one Buffalo would have been out in four

And what problem are you having with playoff games here in
Buffalo Theres the SabresBruins QuebecMontreal and
whatever ESPN and ABC show and on opposite nights theres
TorontoDetroit and whatever ESPNABC shows  More hockey than a
good chunk of North America either side of the border  Its
wonderful and there are thousands of folks whod kill to be in your
shoes coveragewise
