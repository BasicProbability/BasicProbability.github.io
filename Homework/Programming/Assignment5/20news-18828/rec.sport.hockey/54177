Subject ESPN fck up


	Okay heres some gripeing griping whatever

	I live in Santa Barbara for reference I think

	Okay ABC showed the KingsFlames fine YAWN

	ESPN through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the
  Red WingsToronto game cool

	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that
  ESPN would show PittNJ on Tuesday and BosBuff on Thursday

	I raced home from work early 430 Pacific to catch the game but
  ALAS it was the BostonBuffalo game and then they promised that they would
  show the PittNJ game on Thursday  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind

	I didnt mind THAT MUCH  I watched the game hockey is MUCH better
  than NO hockey  During the game their were no video highlights from the
  Patrick division  What the hell was going on  At least they should show
  video highlights of the other games especially the NYICaps game that was
  so close  My father lives in Bowling Green Kentucky Bumbfck Egypt
  got to watch the Pens game on ESPN  I just dont get it

	The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didnt want
  to see the PittsburghNew Jersey game 2 will turn on their TVs on Thursday
  and see the PittsburghNew Jersey game 3 instead of the BuffaloBoston game
  3  At least in my case I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game

	If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on
  Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN Id be mad as
  hell

	Oh well hopefully well get better coverage next year OR
  SOMETHING

PS  The announcers for the BuffaloBoston were the worst that I have
	ever heard as far emotion goes  They had the enthusiasm of
	Droopy Dog  I hope for better on Thursday
