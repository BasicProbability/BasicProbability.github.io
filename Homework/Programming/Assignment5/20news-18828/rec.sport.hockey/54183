Does anyone recieve annoying email from Roger Maynard whenever they post an
article telling them to leave him alon and stop posting to the group
These emails are filled with insults more than are usual in Rogers posts
and have little if any hockey info
I have recieved two in the last 2 days
I am just wondering if I am special or Roger trys to bully everyone who
disagrees with him

You cant be serious  I and many of my colleagues have not received any
bad emails from Roger in fact Roger happens to have answered most if not
all of my hockey questions and curiosities so before you start flaming
at me or Roger better reconsider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the
like
