I heard a little while back that Gary Roberts would be returning to play
in Calgarys last regular season game  Can anybody confirm this
Hell be a big help to the Flames in the playoffs and may change my
playoff pool strategy


Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal 38th
and an assist

This definitely bolsters Calgarys chances in the playoffs
