 United States TV Schedule
 April 18   DevilsIslanders at Pittsburgh   1 EST  ABC
 April 18   St Louis at Chicago             12 CDT ABC
 April 18   Los Angeles at Calgary           12 PDT ABC

Okay heres the down side of the ESPN deal no additional coverage
With a split contract SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers
like CanucksJets Capswhoever and Red WingsLeafs or whoever else
is playing

 April 20   DevilsIslanders at Pittsburgh   730   ESPN
 April 22   TBA                              730   ESPN
 April 24   TBA                              730   ESPN

Does anyone know if there will be alternate games in cities where
local broadcast rights are being protected

For our area IslandersDevils its likely to be the Bruins since
the other Adams series is MontrealQuebec  Id prefer the latter
myself 

Im under the impression that the ABC deal overrides the local deals
but if St Louis at Chicago pops up well know
