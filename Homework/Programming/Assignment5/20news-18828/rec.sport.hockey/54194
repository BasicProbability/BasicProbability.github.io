 	Here is an update on the Goalie mask poll
 	First since so many people gave me their 3 best I decided to
 give 3 pts for their favorite 2 pts for 2nd 1 for 3rd If you emailed
 a response with only one I gave it 3 pts Please feel free to send me
 your 2 other favorites if you only sent one before 
 	Also votes are still welcome Any mask you like will do as I 
 have received votes for players not in the NHL Please mention what team
 they play for though
 	So here are the uptodate results so far
 
 


My vote goes to Andy Moog 1st Belfour 2nd Vanbiesbrouck 3rd

The Bruins are hot at just the right time
