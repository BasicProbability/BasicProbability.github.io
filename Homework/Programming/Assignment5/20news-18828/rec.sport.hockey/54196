Does anyone recieve annoying email from Roger Maynard whenever they post an
article telling them to leave him alon and stop posting to the group
These emails are filled with insults more than are usual in Rogers posts
and have little if any hockey info
I have recieved two in the last 2 days
I am just wondering if I am special or Roger trys to bully everyone who
disagrees with him

You cant be serious  I and many of my colleagues have not received any
bad emails from Roger in fact Roger happens to have answered most if not
all of my hockey questions and curiosities so before you start flaming
at me or Roger better reconsider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the
like

Speaking of Roger where is his comments from last nights game You have
to admit he can make a nothing game sound like it was game 7 of the
Stanley Cup finals
Roger pushes the Leafs so much it even bothers me a long time supporter
but he does have a good overall idea of the game
Wow I just gave RM a compliment guess I better stop it with the Rye 
Water before I give him another
