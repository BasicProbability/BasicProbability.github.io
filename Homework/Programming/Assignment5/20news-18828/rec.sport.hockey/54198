   plusminus  it is the most misleading hockey stat available

Not necessarily the most misleading but you are right it definitely
needs to be taken in the proper perspective A shining example is
if you look at the Penguins individual  you will find very few minuses
That only makes common sense since they didnt lose many games

   Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
   time per game and some measure of its quality ie is the player put out
   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
   against the other teams top one or two lines shorthanded etc I would
   much rather see the  disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications

Unfortunately you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to
really come up with a statistic which really shows a players value
Lets just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it like Im doing now
excuse me
