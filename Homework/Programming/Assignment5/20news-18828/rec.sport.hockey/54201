Heres one from the mill  The Oilers MIGHT move to Hamilton
where Porklington can get a free deal

Given what Labour relations and Puck has been like it WOULD be a sigh of 
relief

This WAY w4e can can BOTH elements

Well Dave I would have to disagree with you there  Satan himself could
own the team and Id be happy as long as the Oilers stayed in Edmonton
Selfish but true  I dont want to see the Oilers move no matter who
their owner is

Bart bartsplungeuucp  or  bartonaitabca

I too am of the same  sentiment Bart but realistically this town DOESNT WANT TO pay for 
quality player and hence we are loosing these people left right and center
Labour is also responsible for their boycott Pocklington movement
I would like the Oilers to stay but realistically given this situation its 
byebye Oilers
