That more or less says it  I flicked the Penguins game on briefly and saw
Ulf crosscheck Valeri in the face  I am wondering if Don Cherry is going to
go off on this at all in coachs corner

Nah Cherry will only spew if Ulf was nailing a good Canadian boy

What an idiot if this is the heart and soul of Canadian patriotism 
then someone needs a new hobby
