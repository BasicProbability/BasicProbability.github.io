At 1024 pm Friday night The Arena crowd of 17965 paid homage to Blues
goalie Curtis Joseph The fans began bowing their arms extended taking the
the lead from a fan who held a sign that read Only God Saves More Than
Joseph  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph who has brought the Blues to
the verge of a surprising sweep

Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday blanking the Blackhawks
30 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 30
lead in the bestofseven series

The Blackhawks havent scored against Joseph since the 851 mark of the second
period of Game 1 Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds
a Blues record Jacques Plante held the previous record of 14628 set in the
first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers one of only
two series the Blues have sweeped in their history

The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4
a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday The Blues have had
only two sweeps in franchise history both in 1969 when they swept
Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals

The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to
make 47 saves This time the Blues held the shots down to 34 and the
Blackhawks couldnt touch Joseph

Well they touched Joseph numerous times shoving him and pushing him at 
every opportunity to try to get him off his game But Joseph and the Blues
were unfazed dishing out their own punishment along the way

The Blues grinders  Bob Bassen Rich Sutter Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry 
wore down the Blackhawks taking the visitors from Chicago off their game
The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys the gifted playmakers and
scorers who made the most of their opportunities

Craig Janney Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored getting one goal in each
period Hull assisted on Janneys firstperiod power play goal after two unwise
Chicago penalties Checker Miller set up Hulls goal in the second period and
rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson who scored at 1644 of the final 
period

Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling
Sweep Sweep Sweep They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour 
BellFour BellFour They also chanted Na nanana heyhey good bye

Such talk is a tad premature Theres still one game left but the Blues are
on a roll They have the Blackhawks on their heels

The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first
minute of play Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment and Brendan Shanahan
dumped Steve Smith at center ice

Chicago tried to retaliate but Troy Murrays decision to run into Joseph
backfired Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty

The Blues didnt get a shot on goal on the power play and they survived a
scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to
Steve Larmer Joseph stopped Larmers shot and everything else Chicago threw
at him in the first period The Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph
about shooting high and continued to shoot low where Josephs butterfly
style is deadly

Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the
period  two for hooking and one for holding  but Chicago got only two
shots on goal as many as Miller The Blues penalty killer twice stole the
puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour
 
Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up
He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedicans third
penalty He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 1458
and gave the Blues a twoman advantage 107 later when Christian Ruuttu
slashed Shanahan

The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play and Hull got it
where he likes it  in the high slot Hulls shot hit Belfours right
shoulder and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line Belfour
dived back to cover but the puck squirted loose to Janney who poked it into
the net at 1653 for his first goal of the playoffs

The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended and the
Blackhawks lost their composure Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds
remaining in the period and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by
shooting the puck into the Blues bench

Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice and
Marouelli slapped him with a 10minute misconduct Chicago survived the Blues
power play but the loss of Chelios hurt He didnt return until the midway
point of the period and within three minutes of his return Hull had increased
the Blues lead to 20 deflecting in Millers crisp pass

Try as they might the Blackhawks couldnt get to Joseph who stopped
everything they could throw at him He stopped 12 shots in the second period
and 13 more in the third Chicago also hit the goalpost twice

Emersons goal put the game away He went hard to the net and redirected
Felsners pass
