 And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
 resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other 
 team captain trivia would be appreciated
 
 Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit
 following the 198990 season This was during the offseason though
 
 Theres countless examples of captains being traded Im sure

Yeah I think that the Flames and the Flyers traded Captains once Mel  
Bridgeman for Brad Marsh
