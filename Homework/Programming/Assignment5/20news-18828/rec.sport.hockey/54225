The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCICablevision connection in the
merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks Prime SportsChannel
will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the offseason Also TCI
and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of 15 million subscribers TCICablevision will
do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully And the
NHLs value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC
and ESPN NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime
SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local NHLNBAMLB sports teams

Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC
and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners
WhenIf Cablevision VP Chuck Dolans purchase of the Islanders goes
through the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold their
original owners were and theyve remained due to a lucrative TV
contract  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the
Prism pay channel  There are six teams affiliated with regional SCs
another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets and other locals
like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements  With all this
crossownership I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this 
season
