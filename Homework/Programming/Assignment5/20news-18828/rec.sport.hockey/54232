Subject Re POTVIN and HIS STICK

In article 122521netnewsupennedu kkellermailsasupennedu Keith Keller writes
I prefer
to watch hockey than seeing shots of Felix Potvin slashing and spearing Dino
Ciccerelli standing in front of the net  HE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO STAND IN
FRONT OF THE NET JUST NOT IN THE CREASE
 
 Yes he does  BUT the goalie sure as hell doesnt want him there  When
 I played roller hockey boy do I miss those days as a goalie I would
 scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot  I dont care if hes
 in the crease or not get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball
 Yes roller hockey remember  And if there was nobody around to clear
 the slot then Id do it myself by pushing the offending playerhard 
 I hate people in my way when Im the goalie and I am sure Felix does
 too  I should say that I didnt see the incident so if Potvin really
 swung the stick big time then thats not right but he can move people
 out of the way  Hes a player on the ice too you know

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view  I dont like to see stickwork
but you have to clear players away from in front  My personal favorite move
Im a goalie too is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref isnt looking  Makes em go down like a ton of
bricks but doesnt cause injuries unless they dont know how to fall Im 
talking about hitting the blades here not the foot  It also makes the 
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty  Unfortunately it also leaves your blocker out of 
position for a short timeI dont do this if a shot is likely on the short
side  Hmmmaybe I should mail Potvin this method in French and with
helpful diagrams of course  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli who
I have a great deal of respect for BTW hes not a big guy but he plays
huge fall on his back a few times
