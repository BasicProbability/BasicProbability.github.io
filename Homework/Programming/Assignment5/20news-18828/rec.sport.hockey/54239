 Roger Neilson is not property  among other rumours hes now
the 1 candidate to coach the Flyers and will bring along Colin
Campbell as his assistant


This would be dumb move of the ninetiesLindros is big and strong
but why give him a ball and chain on one leg and an anchor on the
other to drag along

 Compuware is actively scouting Phoenix for a new team in 9495 hey
Nick and Jimmy  buy the Devils and fix them here please  gld


Not if Pocklington gets there first actually if Pocklington
doesnt get a better deal he would probably go to Hamiltontaking
the team out of Canada would get the whole country mad at him
taking the team to Hamilton wouldnt get anybody mad at him that 
isnt mad at him alreadyand would make him a lot of friends
in Southern Ontarioso many that the whining of the stupid politicians in
Edmonton and the fickle spoiled fans wouldnt be noticed at all
Edmonton would wallow in anonymnity
