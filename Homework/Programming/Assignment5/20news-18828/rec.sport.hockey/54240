Don got his nickname Grapes but Im not sure  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins  I dont know exactly when that was  Could someone fill
me in on this info

I think that the name grapes came because as coach for the Bruins 
or in the minors  he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting 
dehydrated during the games  His dog Blue may have been named 
cause he liked Labatts beer  anyone know about that 

According to Quotations from Chairman Cherry Don was playing in
Springfield He and another player had to pay some fines the other
player had his paid off but not Don didnt want to

Don called the other player a teachers Pet and the other player
replied Ah thats just sour grapes

Dont know how accurate that is but thats whats printed
