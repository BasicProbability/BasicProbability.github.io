Subject Leafs win thank you Potvin

Its about time the boys got it together
They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games
But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full
gear or is that high gear in game 3  Except for a 1015 minute stretch
in the 2nd period they outskated and outworked the Wings  Please dont
flame this statement cos you know its true  I have to admit that 
goaltending was the key  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy
stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd  He also kept the rebounds to a
minimum something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals  Clark even looked like
he had stopped moping first star although I still dont know why he
was so flat in games 1 and 2

If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game
3 they may actually have a chance of winning this series a slim chance 
but a chanceIm no RMwhere is he anyways haha
