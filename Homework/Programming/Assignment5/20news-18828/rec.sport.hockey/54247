Fuhr is proving the Fuhrbashers wrong but Boston is an awfully
good team


Yehbut 

1Biran Sutters playoff record as the head coach in StL wasnt very
impressive His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs
It doesnt look like this trend will change with the Bruins

2 Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 20 in their
entire 68year history It doesnt look like Buffalo will just lose
their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on
his head

Basicallythe Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend
Alsoit seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after
an incredibly great start by the Red Soxbest record in their major
leagues as of now I would say that 70 of the callers to the Bruins
flagship stationSportsRadio 590 are talking about the Red Soxabout
15 are yapping about the Patriots upcoming draft10 are on the Celtics
and about 5 are on the Bruins
Somehowno one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding
early
