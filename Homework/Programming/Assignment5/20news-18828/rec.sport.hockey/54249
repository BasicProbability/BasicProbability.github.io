Subject Some Playoffs Thoughts


Well were almost halfway through the first round and so far things are
good in general

  1 The 2 teams that I hate most Chicago and Basten are down 3 zip
     even though there is a possibility either can still win their
      series yet this egothrashing and arrogancesmashing by the
      underdogs St Louis and Buffalo is so rewarding
  2 Montreal is at this stage in a teams life where they are not good
     enough to go all the way yet too good to be able to get some
     really good draft picks 
  3 Is it just me or does anyone out there also think that this year
     the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES
  4 Is it just because theyre playing Montreal that I find the diques
     arrogant s or are they really
  5 Smythewhat Im really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel
     night in and night out We should see some CanucksJetsFlames
     action
  6 Don Cherry is an  alright but hey so are our politicians
  
ObLeafsJoke  Q what do you get when you cross a maple leaf and a 
                groundhog
              A Six more weeks of crummy hockey

L8R dudes
GO HABS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
