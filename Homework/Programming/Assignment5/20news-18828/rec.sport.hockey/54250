When is the draft this year  And will there be any coverage
I know the upcomming NFL draft is on ESPN

Anyone got the details

Paul Kariya 1993 1 Pick No 2 perhaps  He wont last long 

I dont know the exact coverage in the states  In Canada it is covered
by TSN so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage  I dont know

As for the picks
Ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that Alexander Daigle will 
go 1 Hell either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec  IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didnt show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov I think thats it or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer probably spelt the last name wrong

	The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob
	Niedermayer a center his brother Scott  is a defenseman
	picked by NJ a couple years ago  They brought him in for a
	physicaltryout a week or so ago From what I have read
	Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft plays BOTH
	offense and defense and isnt afraid of physical play
	Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of
	defense prospects Rathje Sykora Ragnarsson and our
	centers Kisio et al are getting old

	With all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CANt
	see them picking yet another small player like Kariya hed
	just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated 
	shoulder
