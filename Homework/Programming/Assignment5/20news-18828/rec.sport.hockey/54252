Subject Re Keenan signs with the Rangers

Just heard on the news that Mike Keenan formerly of the Blackhawks Flyers
and General of a Siberian Prison has just signed to coach the Rangers  The
Rangers who won the Presidents Cup last year have slipped just a bit at the
end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers
The Flyers fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision because
they were very interested in him  Oh well

At least we got somebody the Flyers wanted 

Is this really true  I have not been keeping up with any news  If it is
whats the deal with Neil Smith  Is he gone too
