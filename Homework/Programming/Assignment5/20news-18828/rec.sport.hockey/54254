In case anyone missed it Im reposting this and Im also selling some other
stuff

I would like to sell a few of my Hockey Cards sets

199091 Upperdeck Hockey Low s Sets 45

This is the first Upperdeck Hockey Set made Important rookie cards in it are
Mogilny Roenick Belfour Recchi Stevens Jagr Nolan Nedved Ricci 
Sundin Modano Richter and others The Beckett price is 42 but Im
Charging 45 to cover the Shipping and Packaging

Ive sold one but I still have 2 left for sale I also realize that 45 is
alot of money especially if you dont normally collect cards So if enough
people are interested Ill break up the set into team sets Im not sure
how much for each It would be nice to just sell them for 3 each but then
the people who get the Whalers and Devils Note Im not bagging on these teams
its just that they dont have alot of good rookie cards in this set would
be subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh So Ill have to make
it varialble pricing But most of them should be about 2 or 3 dollars


199192 Score Pinnacle Candian Sets 45

This is a very nice set premium quality cards Has second year cards of the
players above plus Bure Potvin Falloon and Lindros 15 value second year
cardsand the following rookie cards Lidstrom Kamensky Zelepukin Roussel
Konstantinov Beckett Price is 50 but I have alot of these

199192 Upperdeck Czechoslovakian Set 60

This is a 100 card set of the 92 World Junior Tournament Meant for sale in
Czechoslovakia but didnt sell well there and some of it filtere back in
to the US The cards are Bilingual Has Lachance Kovalev and Straka Rookies
If your interested please email me Thanks

Ok someone asked for this one but hes from Canada if he can get me the
money in US funds then its his if not the first person who writes in will
be the alternate

Also I would like to sell 2 Upperdeck Pavel Bure rookie cards note these
are not in the UD low s set mentioned above 16 each They are 15 in
the book but the 1 goes for postage packaging and insurance

And if there is something you want that you dont see email me I may have
it or may be able to get  it for you

Thanks
