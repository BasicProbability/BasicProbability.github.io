        I do not have cable and on the nights the Caps dont 
play I would like to tune in other games  Does anyone have a 
list of the radio stations which broadcast the games for the NHL
teams

Here are the ones I can remember offhand

     KDKA    1020 AM   Pittsburgh Penguins

Lori the regular Penguins poster here on recsporthockey indicated to me
via email that on the nights that Pirates baseball and Penguins playoff 
games coincide the Pens will be covered on WDVE FM 1025

     WABC     770 AM   New Jersey Devils
     WBBM     780 AM   Chicago Blackhawks
     WJM   720 AM   Detroit Redwings
           
This is WJR in Detroit and its 760 AM However as I neglected to mention in
my earlier response to this thread  on the nights when the Tigers baseball
games coincide with the Wings playoff games the Wings will be carried on
WLLZ FM 987
