	ESPN through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the
  Red WingsToronto game cool

	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that
  ESPN would show PittNJ on Tuesday and BosBuff on Thursday

	I raced home from work early 430 Pacific to catch the game but
  ALAS it was the BostonBuffalo game and then they promised that they would
  show the PittNJ game on Thursday  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind


  What the hell are U talking about ESPN showed PensDevils game as advertised
  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the
  game will be boring Id rather see BostonBuffalo game which seems to be
  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first
  round 

  Well lets hope they change their mind on THUs game and show some other
  game The Pens series is really getting boring I want to see some 
  exciting game no matter who wins If NHL wants a major network contract
  then they better put some brains in ESPN people
