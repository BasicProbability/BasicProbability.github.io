Dons Tie Grant Fuhr Penalties Wings vs Leafs Fighting Dale Hunter

Episode Summary


This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Dons tie Don was
pointing out the characters on the tie Bugs Bunny Foghorn Leghorn
and Yosemite Sam who Don called Lanny Macdonald

Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a
hotel where he was watching the previous nights games because of
all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter
and Fuhr

Don began to praise Fuhr calling him the greatest goalie and
said that hes winning the series against Boston all by himself
He then showed clips from earlier episodes Nov 14 Jan 16 when
Fuhr was still with the Leafs and Don advised Dont Trade Fuhr

Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston it would
be Fuhr who wins the series Muckler took a lot of heat for the
trade but Don feels Mucklers been vindicated

The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by
too many penalty calls He showed a clip from a WinnipegVancouver
game where Domi hit a Vancouver player and was given a 2 min penalty
Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved
but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit with Domi
hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder Don Its sad what
theyre doing for hockey a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed

Next they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto
People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke Wendy for not fighting
However Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either

This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork and how
banning fighting leads to more high sticking Its like college
hockey The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody
Thats why youre seeing so much stickwork Because they know you
wont drop your gloves and give them a shot The rules are made
by people who dont know whats going on in hockey

The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter Don pointed out
that he was leading the league in goals and showed a clip
of Hunter from a previous game When he was younger Hunter was
taught to play to win which differs from todays idea of
just letting kids have fun

At then end of the episode they showed a clip from a coachs
corner with the tape on fast forward so that Don sounded like
one of the chipmunks
