Episode Summary


Once again the episode started with a shot of Dons tie This
was a different tie than last time Don pointed out some of the
characters on the tie but gave them different names Felix the
Cat Sylverster Maclean Daffy Duck etc

Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current WingsLeafs
game Don thought it was good Burns told the Leaf players They
won in their building were going to win in ours

Don then began to praise Gilmour again Don pointed out that Gilmour
has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he
got 5 points in a game against St Louis  Don also claims that
he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour which was partly responsible
for his good play Several clips were then shown of Gilmour
from the series A hit on Constantinov and a pass to Andrewchuk
resulting in a goal

On the game itself the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in
the first period The Wings have enough talent to score short handed
however and when the Leafs get a power play Coach Burns tells
the Leaf players Dont let them score on you

Ron brought up the previous QuebecMontreal game Note Montreal
won that game in overtime despite having a possible game winner
disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick Don
thought the high stick was obvious even without the use of
instant replay

On the BuffaloBoston series Note Buffalo is currently winning
the series 30 Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr
Fuhr should be getting 12 the teams playoff checks for his
play

Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance
during the DetroitToronto series Don defended him by saying
that he cant play the way he should because of the leagues
new rules This used to be a rough and tough league Now its
all hack and slash Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the
problems

Dons opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings
GM and coach Bryan Murray A clip from a news conference by Murray
was shown in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination
of fighting increases stickwork Don also read a newspaper article
in which Murray makes the following statements Players dont fight
because theyre afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator
Instead they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing
each other Is this what the fans want to see I guarantee there
wouldnt be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game

Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to smarten up with
fighting in hockey He went on to say that before there used
to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series Now with no fights
someone gets cut every period

Rating

Typical antifighting posturing but here Dons opinion is supported
by Murray

Id give it a 70 out of 10
