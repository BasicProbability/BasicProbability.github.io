I think the threeheaded GMs guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage

Doesnt sound like a bad strategy to me

No and in fact that was Ferreiras original strategy which the troika
proceeded to simply continue to implement There wasnt exactly a radical
shift in policy when he was ousted something people seem to forget The
only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if
he stayed or whether the basic strategy was flawed since Ferreira has been
quoated as saying hes going to do something different in Anaheim with the
Ducks my guess is that it wasnt as good in practice as it was on paper
and hes tweaking it a bit second time around One also has to wonder
whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadnt had those
injuries and whether were complaining about the weather because an
earthquake collapsed the root cellar

Of course Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal
contributions before he was fired so its not clear that this would have
been different  Besides they were marginal contributors

Lets also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came THIS close to trading Kelly
Kisio which if the rumors Ive heard are true was over the strong
objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the threeheaded consensus oriented GM

Imagine for a second where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine
hadnt jammed

With or without Mullen they werent going to be a playoff team what good
does it do them to hang onto a player whod rather be elsewhere  

Especially an unhappy player that isnt playing as well because of it Not
that Id accuse Mullen of tanking but his motivation simply wasnt there
and that kind of thing can affect the team

An example from this season Skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept because of his age I thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around

The youth movement has its advantages look at Gaudreau who
might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around But
you have to find the right balance

Right balance for what  Thats the issue  

Exactly At the time they let Skriko go we hadnt yet had the major injury
bugs that killed us later Id much rather have Skriko around than someone
like Dean Kolstad but at that point that wasnt the choice And since the
choice was more one of Skriko vs someone like John Carter I think the
right choice was made for that time period
