I cant believe that ESPN is making SportsChannel America look good

But only in NYNJ Philadelphia and Chicago Everywhere else the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts

Yes a point welltaken  however even in areas that finally got
some games theres something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news Theres an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City
and well try to get you an update through the show  when you
know that its on a satellites feedhorn somewhere up there 


  Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs  Im here in a
small town in southern Illinois at school  Im from Canada and I know
that cbc and tsn have games on every night  all you have to do is go to
a bar with a satellite  I have watched both games between Mon Que and
toronto and detroit  not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc  They
show all goals from every game that evening so I havent missed a goal
all playoffs  Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao
