  An interesting note  I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team
  I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season and
  then never touched the roster again  I got wrapped up in my own money pool
  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool sorry Andrew
  btw  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and
  maybe John MacLean  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well  Out of
  curiousity I checked the final standings today on rsh only to find to my
  amazement that with absolutely no input the initial team still managed to
  finsh 79th  Im not sure what that implies for those who finished below me
  

  Ciao
