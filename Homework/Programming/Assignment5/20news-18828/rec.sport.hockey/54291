Subject Pilon BITES

Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the lineup besides
Pilon Once again last nights STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the
remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime Even though the Isles
nearly survived Pilons blunder in regulation it was the most inopportune time
for a 5minute major penalty Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the
blueline Pilon backed up and swiped at Cotes nose with his stick Al Arbour
cant be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on
the line I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series but there
must be someone else Bring back the BAMMER Dave Langevin

LETS GO ISLANDERS
