Subject HABS TIE SERIES AT 2 

YAHOOOOOOOOO

The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec
City to play game 5  BTW final score was Habs 3Nords 2

The score might be a bit misleading  The Habs dominated the game
from the 500 mark of the first and then on  The score should have
been 82 if it werent for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall
bastard  Hes the reason the score was as close  Habs winning
goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 107 of the 3rd

Roy had an OK game  He made the first save one way or another
and the defense was there to clear any rebounds

This just in ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 65 in OT
YAHOOOOOOOOOOO  Those suckers got what they deserved

Life is just great Now if my finals would go just as well

Nick Ill take off my town crier hat now
