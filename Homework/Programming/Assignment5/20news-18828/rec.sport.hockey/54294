	I will also be happy will a good performance  We played OK in
Vancouver but much better last night as the big guys were going
for the Jets  

Yep though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simplelast year
I woofed when we went up 31 on the Canucksand look where it got me  

	By the way did Domi play last night  I didnt notice him
on the ice  

Domi got tossed in the 2nd with a highsticking major  He had been
playing with Kris King and Stu Barnesand it was this line that was
arguably the best in the first two games


	I am very glad to have found some places in Champaign
Illinois that have satillite dishes to pick up the CBC Vancouver feed
And Im also glad to have found some other hockey fans some Jets and
some Canucks fans to watch the game with  

Definitely a good thingevery little cheer helps Evan  
Good thing the net doesnt need a voice to operateI wont have one
Sunday night when I get home I hope  White noise here we come  


One thing I WILL say thoughVancouver can KEEP Steve Armitage and
John Garrett as a broadcast teamthose two are BAD especially when
you are spoiled by Don Wittman  At least four or five times Steve called
Barnes Selanne  Whoops
