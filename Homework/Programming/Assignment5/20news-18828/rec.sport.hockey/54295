Subject Sabres Sweep

Its over  the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 65 tonight
to sweep the series A beautiful goal by Brad May Lafontaine set him
up while lying down on the ice ended it Fuhr left the game game with
an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well however the
Sabres will get a weeks rest so injuries should not be a problem

Montreal edged Quebec 32 to square their series which seems to be
headed for Game 7 The Habs dominated the first two periods and were
unlucky to only have a 22 tie after 40 minutes However an early
goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it

The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray
Ferraro 43 the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 30 lead in the
2nd The Isles alltime playoff OT record is now 287
