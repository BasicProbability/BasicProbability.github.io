Subject Pierre Turgeon a stud

Being a a BLUES fan I dont get to see much else from around the league
with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN  I cant get the BLUES games
where I go to school thus I dont get to see a whole lot of other teams
play except for the Hawks  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of
the CapsIsles game  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates
His moves are quick and brilliant  You NY fans should be proud
PS Who won the game CapsIsles
 
Peace
