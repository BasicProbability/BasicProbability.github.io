Reading through most of these hockey news I dont see many Ranger fans writing   

Were here talking about hockey  We dont go away like some teams fans
when the Rangers bite the big one

Yeah I think were used to it by now even if some of us do change our
sigs to root for our second favorite teams 


Im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering1940
Ranger  fan  But remember suffering builds character

I dont care  I want my fcking Stanley Cup  Before I die  AARGH

Ill be happy if they win it before I get out of school the way its going
I may be here saying Piled Higher and Deeper before long



Ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike Islander
fans who only show up when the team wins
This has been observed many times  Its true definitely

I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement
but
by far the worst band  wagon fans are the PIT fans at least at the present
Case in Point  I know a guy who just came to Hockey HellTM from Pitt U
Him  How bout the Pens There Fing awesome
Me  Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesnt mean alot Wait until
	they meet Boston andor Detroit in the Playoffs start
Him  When do the Playoffs start
Me  Uhhhh They started a week ago

Im not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to 
be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
that theyre newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now
and when theyre not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork

As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think theres only one team that can test
Pittsburgh and thats Detroit  This would be the most entertaining and hard
fought series  Mario is amazing
