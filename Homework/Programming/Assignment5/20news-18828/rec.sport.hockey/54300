Im just wondering where all the Bruins fans are  I mean they woofed it
up with about 1000000 posts during the regular season saying that their
fave team was going to kick everyones  in the playoffs and win the Stanley
Cup  While I see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving Im just
curious why all the Boston faithful have stopped posting  I mean I havent
even see just one little Boston fan post cept for the Bruins fans that
arent cocky  Well maybe theyre all out on the golf course or something
but I dont know Id sure like to see where all those Bruins fans are at 

Still here Just doing a little sobbing in our beer so were to busy to
post
