 Actually I was angry when they went away from the Pens game
 Being a Pens fan in central Virginia is kinda tough  I only
 get to see them on ESPN and when they play the Caps cause
 were close enough to DC to get all the Caps games so when
 ESPN switched to the Caps    AAAGGGHHH

TV section and not the sports section for what game will be aired
