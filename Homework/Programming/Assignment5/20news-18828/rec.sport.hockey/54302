Subject Re Radio stations


Add Bostons WEEI590AM as the Bruins flagship station You probably wont
pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since its only a 5000 watt
station The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England
states

This could be the Bruins last year on EEI which also happens to be an
allsports radio station The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy
being moved over to a different stationWMEX 1150AM whenever there
is a the samenight conflict with the NBAs Boston Celtics This happened
28 times during the course of the regular seasonThe Celtics own financially
troubled WEEI The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year Stay
tuned
