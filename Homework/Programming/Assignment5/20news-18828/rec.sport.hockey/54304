  Quoting Cire Y Trehguad to All 


 CYT Hey I am in Iowa and I do not mind ESPN showing the PITTNJD games
 CYT At least I get to see the DEVILSeven if they are gettin there ass
 CYT kicked Perhaps they will score and even win a game or two

 CYT GO DEVILS


I am sorry to tell you this but
I dont think the devils will win
a game against Pittsburg the 
Penguins have so many scoring threats
that you shut down one and another
will kill you
Its too bad but I must conclude that the Penguins will
win their third stanley cup in a row
I hope someone will beat them but I just cannot see it
happening
