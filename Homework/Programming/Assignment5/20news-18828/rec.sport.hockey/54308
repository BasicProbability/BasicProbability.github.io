Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle  He was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
1992  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the WHL

Wood is fairly small for an enforcertype I mean Fleury does a pretty good
job and isnt that large but Dody is no Fleury 

Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup he simply isnt
ready to fight at an NHL level assuming that its his role which is ALL he
really showed us in his few games up from KC  if he can pass shoot or
skate I never saw much of it All he has is a right fist which isnt bad
but at the NHL level the other players are smart enough to grab the thing
before he can land anything significant Once you control that hand hes a
fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything
he wants to him His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach
until he found an opening  and I never once saw him find an opening worth
talking about He got neutralized quickly and stomped on a couple of times

Unless he shows some new tricks in camp hell be on my career minor
leaguer list Since this was his first taste of the NHL I expect the
Sharks gave it to him so hed KNOW what hed have to work on offseason He
needs to get stronger he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some
versatility as something else than a simply goond because he wasnt
particularly good as a goon
