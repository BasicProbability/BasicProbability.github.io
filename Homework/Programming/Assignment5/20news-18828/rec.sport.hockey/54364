Wayne made his own bedchoosing McNall over Sather and hockey
destinyhe should sleep in it instead of whining  Ego got

Absolute nonsense  The decision that was made was Pocklingtons  He chose 
20 mill over Gretzky  If Gretzky wasnt upset about not being able to win
a cup in LA then I submit that he wasnt worth the 20 mill

the best of himhe thought the supporting cast in Edmonton
didnt matterthat he was the show himself

How do you know what he thinks or thought  The only thought that I
can see that you have revealed is your own  You dont like Gretzky
Big deal

Now my only complaint about Lemieux is that he dives too much
but last year Patrick convinced him twice to accept Bowman and hockey
destiny rather than his ego

The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty  What
the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
ref wont be fooled  I cant imagine why anyone would expect someone like
Lemieux to change his game  Why dont you pick on 1 dimensional overrated
type like Hull and Salami
