Well thats really great Pat  I guess since youve played a little you thereby 
qualify as an expert  Especially since you watch all the games on tv  All 
that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato

 Not that I condone violence but Ill make an exception for Mario
Pat Walker

Again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are  Truly a 
stupid statement  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game
Im not saying he is the best to ever play the game but he should come to
mind when that question is asked  Lets face it he just returns from 
radiation therapy with around a dozen games left overtakes Lafontaine for the
scoring lead and then buries him  No I guess he just got lucky
Speaking of Lafontaine now theres a guy who should be considered for the
Hart trophy as well certainly one of the better players in the league this
year
