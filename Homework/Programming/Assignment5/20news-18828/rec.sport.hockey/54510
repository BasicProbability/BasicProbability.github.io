Subject Minnesota Shame

Im a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best I can
here in the hockey hinterlands Oklahoma  Im hoping I can get a
reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas

Ive been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly
THE hockey state in the US  So why is the team moving to a city in
Texas  Is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or
were the Stars really not making a profit  Or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging

As much as Id like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me I
cant help but feel for the people in Minnesota unless they truly
didnt support the team  

Opinions please
