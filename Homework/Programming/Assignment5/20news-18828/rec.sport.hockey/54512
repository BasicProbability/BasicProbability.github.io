 Switzerland beat Sweden in a WC for the first time since 1950 and the Swiss
 now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals if Austria beats
 Italy tonight

 The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop
 pass at his own blue line and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat
 Tommy to the stick side The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald
 was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy
 to make it 02 03 was a nice one Howald entered the Swedish zone slammed
 on the breaks and his shot went in by Tommys far post One of the lousiest
 periods Ive seen Sweden play this year
 Second period saw a new Swedish team and the Swiss had to ice the puck many
 times On a pp Nylander skated in from the boards Pavoni made the initial
 save but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound  Then a power play goal
 from the Swiss a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way
 to the goal and past Soderstrom also Jonas Bergqvist made it 24 after a
 nice pass from Naslund behind the goal Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 34
 just before the end of 2nd period on a pp skated in unattacked in front of
 the goal and put the puck through Pavonis 5hole 
 Third period Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled
 through Pavonis 5hole Then another defensive mistake by the Swedes
 Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close
 range could make it 45 Hollenstein then scored 46 on a 2on1 break away
 and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom

 Russia probably made their best game of the tourney but yet there wasnt
 enough to win against the effective Canadians

 Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post and Dineen just
 deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal Then a power play
 goal after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the
 far post and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov
 Russia won the shots in the first period 125 and they had the most of
 the scoring opportunities but they just couldnt score
 Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th  goal of the WC Kariya
 entered the Russian zone slammed on the break to get past his defenseman
 then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to
 deflect it to Lindros who onetimed the puck
 The Russians then finally got their goal Karpov broke in from the side
 and made a slap shot in Tugnutts top right hand corner
 
 Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya and for Russia Valeri
 Karpov I agree the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya and
 in part also Tugnutt Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes
 and he was very impressive Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros
 after Mike Gartner went out with a ribinjury early in the first period

 Lindros BTW lead the point scoring with 14 pts 95 before this game
 7 pts ahead of the next player ie double as much as the next player
 among those Kariya with 16 Amazing
