From catchernetcomcom Paul W Francisco
Subject Re NHL LETTER  Rogers Response

Again I assume this is not just flame bait by Roger but actually a
truly held opinion  

In article 1993Apr2600470524794ramseycslaurentianca maynardramseycslaurentianca Roger Maynard writes
I would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of
a group that I belong to  And I dont share those views  And I dont
believe that the majority of posters on rshockey share those views 
And so I have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without
making my feelings on the subject clear

Thanks  For speaking for all those who didnt feel it was important
enough to say something themselves  

I wouldnt say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to  It represents a subset that you
dont belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this
isnt a moderated group

Look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint  Three
that come to mind are as follows

1 Say it subtly  Result it may not be clear
2 Say it directly yet politely  Result probably it will spark some 
   interesting conversation
3 Say it directly and obnoxiously  Result validity goes right out
   the window

I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature

You realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be
used against you
