I havent seen any mention of Ogrodnick yet in the box scores

Does anyone know if hes playing

Mike


Hes been out but he isnt injured  He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season  Murray has to sit somebody out though  If the Red Wings hadnt played as well as they did in the first game he may have been in the second  Why should Murray juggle players when the Wings are dominating Toronto like they are
