John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his AllMadden team
a lot over much better receiversfor much the same reasons Cherry
sings the praises of Doug Gilmoura little guy with heartyet one
doesnt see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
lost his marbles

Maybe because John Madden doesnt pretend that his AllMadden team is the
team of the best players  Maybe because John Madden doesnt feel the need
to denigrate players he doesnt choose for his AllMadden team  Maybe
because Madden actually demonstrates some knowledge about football when he
broadcasts a game

 
 Don Cherry doesnt denigrate players except those who dive showboat
 wield their sticks as weapons while hiding behind visors or
 deliberating attempt to injure or aggravate the injuries of others

Not always true In fact in the case of Doug Gilmour he actually praises them

Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherrys opinion Canadian kids
that do them are tough just like a real Canadian 

Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messiers ribs and Don wants Ulfs head Doug
Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstroms arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming 
Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot Most likely the latter

I used to like Don Cherry I thought he was great But Im starting to see
his true colors redneck and the more I see of them the more I think hes
just an asshole
