 I dont think the Sharks should dig into the free agent market  Most of
 the good free agents will require quite a bit of compensation and set the
 Sharks back as far as player development goes remember the Sharks were
 unwilling to give up players in addition to the 2 million they offered for
 Joe Murphy and I think thats a good approach  They tried to sign Sergei
 Makarov before this season because Makarov wouldnt have required compensation

Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this
year I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33year old who
is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4year 2 million contract 
Risebrough matched the offer on Kings request and Makarov has spent the last
quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks Not to mention that hes lost a step and can no longer get himself
into position to make the nifty passes 

I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees
to pay his contract Hes ineffective in Calgary but he might be able to help
a team like San Jose with their shortage of talent If theres no takers and
Makarov doesnt show improvement in training camp I think the Flames will just
bite the bullet and buy out Makarovs contract and release him With his
current attitude he is a detriment to the team
