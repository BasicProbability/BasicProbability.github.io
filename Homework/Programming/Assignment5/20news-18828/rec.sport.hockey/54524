 I for one am happy about the Rangers hiring of Keenan  Its too bad  
that they
 didnt hire him when Smith fired Nielsen maybe he could of staightened  
out the
 babies on this team and made the playoffs  What this team needs is a  
little
 fire under their butts
 
 Reading through most of these hockey news I dont see many Ranger fans  
writing   
 Im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering1940  
Ranger
 fan  But remember suffering builds character
 
 I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that  
last
 dreadful stretch
 
 1 Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we  
see Mike
 Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first  
went
 down
 
 2 Why is Joe Kocur playing every night  He is not Bob Probert  
who is
 tough but also can play
 
 3 How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of  
the
 season  At least he plays with some heart and character draws  
penalties and
 plays 110 when hes on the ice  Was he in the doghouse for some  
reason
 
 4 Joe Cirella  Enough said
 
 Ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike  
Islander
 fans who only show up when the team wins
 
 As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think theres only one team that can  
test
 Pittsburgh and thats Detroit  This would be the most entertaining and  
hard
 fought series  Mario is amazing

I think Joe Kocus should play every night   He is a big physical guy and  
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and  
fists  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going  Plus he helps  
protect the other players  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
on the ice unless he is it  I have seen people start to go after essa  
Tikkanen only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in  I think he is big  
asset but should be third line and special situation only play
