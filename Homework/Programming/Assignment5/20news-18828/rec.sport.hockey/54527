	Okay heres some gripeing griping whatever

	I live in Santa Barbara for reference I think

	Okay ABC showed the KingsFlames fine YAWN

	ESPN through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game showed the
  Red WingsToronto game cool

	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that
  ESPN would show PittNJ on Tuesday and BosBuff on Thursday

	I raced home from work early 430 Pacific to catch the game but
  ALAS it was the BostonBuffalo game and then they promised that they would
  show the PittNJ game on Thursday  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind

rest deleted

    ESPN never committed and I never saw advertised to a particular
Thursday game  They had originally scheduled BosBuf and that was
somehow leaked on this net but to my knowledge ESPN never publicly
released a schedule until Monday when they announced PittNJ Thursday
and BostonBuffalo Saturday
