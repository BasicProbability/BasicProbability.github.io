  Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 20 in
  their entire 68year history

   Which doesnt mean much since the statistics are mostly based on
the 5game playoff format But yes it looks dark for the Bs What a
disappointment

   Still I think the problem is mental They needed the saves Blue
came up with perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around

   Who do you think gets the start in game three I hope it is going
to be Blue If the team can rally around him maybe Moog can too
