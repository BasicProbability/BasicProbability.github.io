Of course Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal
contributions before he was fired so its not clear that this would have
been different  Besides they were marginal contributors

Lets also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came THIS close to trading Kelly
Kisio which if the rumors Ive heard are true was over the strong
objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the threeheaded consensus oriented GM

Imagine for a second where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine
hadnt jammed

On the other hand Im hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
Fereirra made  Imagine indeed but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight

Lets say that in the view of the Sharks upper management the attempt
to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra
Im inclined to take exactly the opposite view  they should have kept
himhes obviously the luckiest man in hockey  Wonder what
sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax  His job I guess

have fun
