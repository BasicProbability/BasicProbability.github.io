 Who should get the Hart
 Gretzky not in a million years  At least not this year
   He hasnt played all year
 Yzerman though it would be nice I dont think hell get it hes
  consistent but not well known  Thought he should be
 Mario  Jesus NO  Its bad enough for me just to utter the word
  without being extremely sick and pissed off  They guys a luber
 I think he should become a stuntman after he retires  Jeez he ha
 s enough expericene falling down  Oope  Stick didnt come anywhe
 re near me gotta fall got to get a penalty against the other
 team  Its the annual whineathon with todays host Jerry
 Lewis  By the way I am Canadian play a little and watched
 Hockey night In Canada Never Missed a Show not one of these
 Well a my home team is in the finals and I was a hockey fan for
 ten minutes now Give me a fking break with this Mario is the
 best player ever  What  Did Gretzky die  I wish Bobby Clarke
 and the Broadstreet Bullies were still around theyd know what
 to do with a whouse like Mario
 Theyd bounce him around like the puck
 Not that I condone violence but Ill make an exception for Mario
 But if Mario is going to complain about being hit someone should
 give him and Scotty something REAL to complain about
 Sorry to ramble  As you can see I hate Mario

You along with Mario Lemieux must be from another planet  The only
difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo Washington Abe
Lincoln and many other great men and women of this world whereas you come
from the one with David Koresh  Yeah Mario is good at drawing penalties
but wouldnt you try do something you do claim to play to give your team
an advantage  I dont remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this
year whereas many others did  Finally Mario has NEVER complained about
being hit  He knows its part of the game he gets back by dishing out an
even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals or setting
them up  Dont you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so
much in his life
