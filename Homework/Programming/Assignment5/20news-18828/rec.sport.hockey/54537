Thats not inner calm  Its boredom and its being spoiled  The Arenas
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted  Its been seemingly forever since the team
lost and weve forgotten what its like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory

I dont really agree with this  But it is an entirely different high
at any rate  The first Cup the Pens won I didnt think about anything
else I just watched Mario and all skate the thing around the ice  Now
it seems to be more of a question whether or not thirty years from now
young hockey fans may there be millions will still ask us what it was
like to watch this team  Thats what they are playing for now  But I
was still as nervous as ever when the Devils were blasting shots at
Barrasso in the final seconds of game three so the fun is far from over
yet

Im not bored either  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup
was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one
But Im every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm
to which Susan originally referred  Inner calm is not boredom

As far as the arena in general being boring well Richards got that right
Its been that way all season  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who
just dont have the same spirit and knowledge as longtime fans  At
last Tuesdays game I overheard a man express surprise that a
goaltender can get an
assist

Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen
at any time  Im confident in the Pens but Im also not stupid enough to
think for one minute that its impossible for New Jersey to blow them out
of this series  I doubt that will happen but its possible  Bored  Uhuh
Spoiled  Not in the least  Forgot what excitement is like  Living through
that amazing streak wasnt exciting  I dont take a darned thing for
granted  God look at Chicago

And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway  It isnt gonna
last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can
