As for the picks
Ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that Alexander Daigle will 
go 1 Hell either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec

I dunno about hat I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that
Ottawas gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger Daigle has
shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havnet liked
and after coming back from his second multigame suspension for being
stupid hes really tanked in his performance His stock is dropping like a
rock 

Also remember that a lot of teh draft 1st stuff comes from the assumption
hell be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects Its not clear that 
Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status Hes still first round but I dont consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point

Its also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos
suspensions

IMO I would
take Kariya  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships  Daigle didnt show this for his junior team

San Jose will then get Kariya

No Kariya wont go in the first three for a very simple reason hes not
leaving college and I dont believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who wont be around for another year or two not
when there is equally good or almost as good stuff available that can make
an immediate impact San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
Niedermayer for that reason Kariya could go 6th or 7th unless a team can
convince him to leave school early which I doubt


My cut on things as they stand today

Draft Order

1 Ottawa 60 Daigle if not 40 Pronger
2 San Jose 80 Niedermayer unless Ottawa skips Daigle Then its open
	it depends on if the Sharks can get a deal for him I dont
	believe they draft him to keep him
3 Tampa Bay whoever Ottawa doesnt take or maybe Koslov
