  Gaetz may or may not be back next
	year but in either event the Sharks have to pick up others

Gaetz wont be back Theres been rumors he was officially released right at
the end of the season when his contract expired but I havent seen
confirmation It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he
wasnt going to make it for a while and the Sharks would have to sign him
to a contract which given his problems competing at the IHL level this
spring doesnt make sense
