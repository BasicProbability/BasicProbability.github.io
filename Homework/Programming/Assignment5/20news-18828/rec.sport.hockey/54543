Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad  I
cant remember how many times during the PenguinsDevils game they showed some
guy without the puck being checked in the corner while the puck was being
fired on goal  In fact I think they even missed one goal completely because
they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner

Now the last time I watched a football game they didnt show the lineman going
at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown     

Is it just me

ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the
followthepuck concept of televising hockey games  One of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on  more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do isos on football players
to be shown between plays

The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile
other times you get burned
