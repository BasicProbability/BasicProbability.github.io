 One last point Darryl Sutter is getting badly out coached by Bob Berry  The
 madder Darryl gets the more he reminds me of Brian  The Hawks are
 quickly loosing thier focus I dont think the Blues will win in 4 but you
 never know

Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players
you sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their
teams in the regular seasonjust too much intensity during the regular 
season  I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read
this itemgee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost 
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs  Kind of makes you wonder

Bottom lineman it is great to be smoking the WartHawks
Agreed Jimthis has been damn sweet so far  About the only thing
that comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fansDetroit
has completely kicked their asses so far  But I will stick with the
Blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far

Stuart Esrock  Bowling Green State U  Go you Blues
