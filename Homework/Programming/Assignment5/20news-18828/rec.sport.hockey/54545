Subject Playoff consecutive loss record

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks much to my delight I
noticed their 8  game playoff losing streak 4 to the Pens last year and
now 4 to the Blues and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive
losses is if there even is one

Im pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak since
theyve had to have lost a series since their last championship whenever that
was

Basically I need something else to rag on my Hawksfan friend with
