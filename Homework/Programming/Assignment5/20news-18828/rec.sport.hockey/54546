 Who should get the Hart
 Gretzky not in a million years  At least not this year
   He hasnt played all year
 Yzerman though it would be nice I dont think hell get it hes
  consistent but not well known  Thought he should be
 Mario  Jesus NO  Its bad enough for me just to utter the word
  without being extremely sick and pissed off  They guys a luber
  to ramble  As you can see I hate Mario

im not going to bother reprinting your pathetic excuse for a post Mario  
fan or not you have to respect what he can do with a blade as for the  
hart trophy i guess winning the scoring title after being out twentyfour  
days with CANCER then leading his team to the presidents trophy and  
breaking the win streak record in the process shouldnt even qualify him  
for the award maybe next year hell tend a few games when barrasso needs  
a rest be realistic mario has earned every one of his accolades and  
deserves all the attention that he gets lose the jealous attitude and you  
may start enjoying hockey at its finest
