 I for one am happy about the Rangers hiring of Keenan  Its too bad  
 that they
 didnt hire him when Smith fired Nielsen maybe he could of staightened  
 out the
 babies on this team and made the playoffs  What this team needs is a  
 little
 fire under their butts
 
 Reading through most of these hockey news I dont see many Ranger fans  
 writing   
 Im new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering1940  
 Ranger
 fan  But remember suffering builds character
 
 I have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that  
 last
 dreadful stretch
 
 1 Knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline why didnt we  
 see Mike
 Hurlbut who played pretty well when he was called up when Leetch first  
 went
 down
 
 2 Why is Joe Kocur playing every night  He is not Bob Probert  
 who is
 tough but also can play
 
 3 How come Paul Broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of  
 the
 season  At least he plays with some heart and character draws  
 penalties and
 plays 110 when hes on the ice  Was he in the doghouse for some  
 reason
 
 4 Joe Cirella  Enough said
 
 Ranger fans may be suffering but were some of the most loyal unlike  
 Islander
 fans who only show up when the team wins
 
 As far as the Stanley Cup goes I think theres only one team that can  
 test
 Pittsburgh and thats Detroit  This would be the most entertaining and  
 hard
 fought series  Mario is amazing

 I think Joe Kocus should play every night   He is a big physical guy and  
 he gets the fans into the game with some big hits  both checks and  
 fists  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going  Plus he helps  
 protect the other players  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
 on the ice unless he is it  I have seen people start to go after essa  
 Tikkanen only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in  I think he is big  
 asset but should be third line and special situation only play
 
 
 
This is fast becoming a game without the goons  I admit Kocur may get the
fans into the game but surely they would rather see Broten taking a pass from
Kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the Rangers up 3 magic  goals in
the third period rather than seeing Kocur take another stupid penalty and the
Rangers giving up another powerplay goal 

The Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off
Messier and the first line  Nemchinov is a perfect third line center

So who goes Beezer or Richter
