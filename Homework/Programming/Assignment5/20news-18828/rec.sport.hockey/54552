The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere

  Gerald look at what happened to the Stars they are off to Dallas


Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantagethe provincial
government is months away from a provincial electionit is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price
and it is before the NHLs new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenuesharing

Gerald the Alberta election is slated fou 7 June unless something REALLY goes 
wrong this time  Pocklington could end up being THE embarassment of Klein
if he goes ahead with his ultimatum


Pocklington is many thingsstupid is not one of them

Gerald  people still have an axe to grind with this guy  I CANNOT see him staying for long

He can dictate termsbecause other cities will pay his
price if Edmonton doesnt

But the people in Edmonton wont budge trust me on this one

Edmonton has already  up its international airport and
surrendered supremacy to Calgary and over the next few years
Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks
It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team toobecause Northlands wants
to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing

Northlands wont budge ccording to one of the board members Bruce Campbell

However in this case about the longterm financial
viability of the Oilers the fact is that Pocklington is basically 
right regardless of who owns the team and it is right to provoke
the crisis now before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money

I havent heard anything BUT attendance at the Coliseum was the lowest this 
year  HINTHINT  Remeber what I said about a personal vendetta

Sather has done his jobthe Oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon Al Strachan one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in Canada in a postmortem of the Oilers season in
the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me

Gerald dont blame Sather  This battle between the peole and Pocklington
started in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky  

There were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was
respectalbe I use to do so in 1982  1983 season  but those days are GOE
