If the Islanders beat the Devils tonight they would finish with
identical records  Whos the lucky team that gets to face the Penguins
in the opening round   Also can somebody list the rules for breaking
ties
      As I recall the Penguins and Devils tied for third place last year
with identical records as well  Poor Devils  they always get screwed
Yet they should put a scare into Pittsburgh  They always do  Pens in 7
