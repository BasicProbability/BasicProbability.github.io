        Goodbye Minnesotayou never earned the right to have an NHL
franchise in the first place
        Hope you enjoy your Twin city wide mania for HIGH SCHOOL HOCKEY
hey by the way my old pee wee team is having a reunion in Regina care
to come up and film the event
        Yee haa Golden Gophers
Whatta weird town
   Minnesota definitely deserves an NHL franchise  Youll see the
Minnesota Whalers pretty soon so fear not Minnesota fans  No Norm Green
cept for the team color sorry bad pun

   What a difference two years makes  Minnesota finished 293714 in 1992
and made the finals  They finish with a better record at  383810 thi year
and move to Dallas  Every team in the playoffs has a winning record
Finally  Its about time NHL
