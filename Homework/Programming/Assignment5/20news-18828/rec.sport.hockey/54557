Subject Re Bernie Nicholls  What a man

from Matthew Rush
but hes starting to push it over the edge IMHO  Of course
Holiks chop to Barrassos neck wasnt too sportsmanlike either
It seems that he was following the The only way to beat the
Penguins is to injure them philosophy

Its pretty obvious that Holiks hitting Barrasso was an accident He
was even apologizing for it immediately before the Penguins all jumped
on him
