Read this all you Canucks fan out there
Winnipeg are going to kick Vancouvers butts so badly they are not going to
be able to sit down for weeks
And no this is NOT a joke
A prediction before the fourth game in Winnipeg

Winnipeg 6 Vancouver 2  201230
Selanne Steen score a couple of goals each

Winnipeg to win Stanley cup playoffs


To all you Jets FanaticsHa ha ha
To normal Jets FansIt was a pretty good fourth game More physical
play than Ive seen in the first three games

These moronic posts that have continued throughout the year about how
the Jets will cremeate the Canucks and Selanne will smash Bure into the
boards is so full of it Why dont you take a cue fromm Daryl and just
wait till its over before you make more of a fool of yourself

Im not going to predict anything about the Canucks They are up 31 and
are coming back home but Im not going swing any it around until the
series is wrapped up

Tony

Bravo Tony

I too am sick of all the mindless fanatical blind faith Jets fans who could 
prpbably predict the end of the world more accurately than the coutcome of a
playoff series

Now I will admit that I am a mindless fanatica blind faith Canucks fan
But unlike those from Winterpeg I do not need to vent my spleen upon the 
world as to how great my team is  I know I have confidence in them and
thats enough

Granted the Jets finished the season hot and the Canucks were having trouble
but Vancouver has built themselves a reputation for being a playoff team  
Just ask any Flames fan  They may not win every series but they alway fight
to the end  Ill admit that last year was not great but if they combine
the work ethic of the past with the new tallent of the present they will
be tough to beat note I did not say they would pummel every team they meet 
and destroy the greatest player playing today

Now like any Canucks fan I would love to see them take the cup  I feel
they have a good chance to make it out of the Smythe and a 5050 shot at
Detroit I cant see them losing to St Louis  If Pittsburgh makes it to
the cup Id have to put my money on them Yes even if theyre facing the
Canucks  If Buffalo Montreal or Quebec beat Pittsburgh Id choose the
winner of Vancuover and Detroit to take the cup

Oh and one parting note for the Jets fans Just how many times has 
Winnepeg made it to the finals 8

Go Canucks

Greg

Devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display
by MacLean  The Canucks tied up the Jets so tightly that I thought that
they were mailing them

BTW Gregnext time dont fall asleep in geography class its pretty
sad when a fellow in Norway can spell Winnipeg properly and a guy in
North America cant

One more thinghow LONG has Vancouver been in the NHL  How many
championships do they have  

Oh yeahand I CAN go to the Arena and see not one not two but
six championship banners hanging from the rafters  3 Stanley Cup
banners and 3 Avco Cup banners  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has
won the Cup once as many times as the rockin town of Kenora has won it
