Potvin by the way has played very well  He kept Toronto in the game
last night during those 5 penalties in the first period by making great
saves but they did end up getting to him in the second

	The guy has a GAA of 600 in the playoffs and hes played very
well Hahahahahaa What a joke


Did you watch the games
