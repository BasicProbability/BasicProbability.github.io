In last nights game Toronto received FIVE penalties Detroit none  If


 
 Which game were you watching  Didnt you see the third period when
the Wings had 2 penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty
The Leafs had a 2 man advantage for about a minute and a 1 man advantage
for another minute or two and the Leafs still couldnt score
  And I wonder how the Leafs scored a powerplay goal if according
to you they never had a powerplay
  In the Detroit paper today it said there were 40 penalties called in
last nights game And youre saying Detroit had none of those penalties
Im guessing you only watched the first period I have to admitt the Leafs
did get alot of penalties in that period where as the Wings didnt get
many if any at all Havent looked at the box scores yet  But the
ref more than made up for it in the third period

Go Wings

My apologies for the typo  I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the
first period and the Leafs none  

As well my point isnt that the refs were biased just that they were
calling a lot of penalties which works to the benefit of the Wings

Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then
calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away
from what could have been a great game
