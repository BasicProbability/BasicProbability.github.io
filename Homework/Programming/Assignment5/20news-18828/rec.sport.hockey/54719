 Once again the Leafs overcame the Red Wings in what was possibly the
 most exciting game played yet in this playoff year

Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen  For
most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity 
it was nowhere near the most exciting game

Paul Stewart called the single worst game Ive seen this year  
Federovs major was obvious and I dont dispute it  However Chaissons 
penalty shouldnt even have been a penalty let alone a major and a
game misconduct  The 5minute game misc call is for high sticking only 
There is no blood penalty  Just because  Chaisson barely touched the 
poor sap and he hit the dasher and bled profusely doesnt mean it is a 
penalty 

Unfortunately the instant replay is not used on hits  At first I
immediately thought 5 and a game because the hit looked much more severe
from an intenttoinjure perspective than it was  After seeing the replay
Id say it deserved 24 minutes for boarding it was careless any way you 
slice it  If Stewart had replay I do not think Chaisson would have gotten
5 and the game

In the second period behind Potvin Probert had the puck and was
going to get out front and was tackled  I couldnt believe the nocall

This nocall was bullshit I agree I admire Stewart for letting them go but
Probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty  Ive never
seen Probert whine either he doesnt need to  Now if Probie
decides to put Wendel through the boards hes probably gone right

I dont remember who on the Leafs touched the puck 
on Racines shot towards the end of the game 432 seconds left but Stewart
called it out of play last touched by Detroit  Everybody in the Garden
including the Linesmen knew it  Yzerman protested but Stewart just 
laughed and really homered the Wings

This was also bullshit  But once again no replay  It was Rouse btw Im
really pissed that the linesmen didnt correct the call eitherits bs
when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake  

But when it all comes down to it Wings played like shit

Yes  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit
loss  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin but the
Wings have no excuses for Game 4  They should be the superior team

The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his
stick in somebodys eye  That was the most dangerous stick infraction I
have seen in a long time and everybody in the damn league knows hes an
asshole when it comes to stickwork  Four lousy minutes  Bullshit call 
Murray should send the tape in  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out
of him
