Subject Re Pens fans reactions


Susan Dart writes

Amongst Penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that Ive never
experienced before this year with the Pens The players and the fans have so
much confidence in the team this year Were savoring every game and saving
our energy for the Stanley Cup

Thats a good way to put it  Its a quiet confidence  I dont feel like
I have to defend this team anymore 

The Devils are a puzzle to me  They have long been one of the few teams
I always dreaded playing  Their D isnt quite what it used to be but they
still usually play us pretty tough  I just cant figure it out  At least
last night they mounted an attack

	2 Watching some of the Devils players being interviewed I could
	   see in their faces and eyes that they really dont have any
	   confidence They are left speechless when asked what more they
	   can to do to beat the Pens They act as though they know its
	   a hopeless task

Bernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news  He was
shaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso saying that Tommy is like
another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him
Then he got this faraway look on his face his voice started trailing
off and he said It just isnt rightit just isnt fair and he
tried to muster a smile

Im really impressed with Bowmans coaching tactics  hes had an answer for
every move that Brooks has thrown at the Pens

As far as coaching goes a PensIslanders matchup should be pretty good

One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri  Im sure
Tom Barrasso knows how he feels  For so long Tommy would look up and not
have a teammate in sight  Terreris teammates really left him out in the
cold in the first two games
