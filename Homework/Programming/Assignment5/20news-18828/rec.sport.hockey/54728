So whats stopping Pocklington from going to a bank and borrowing 41
million dollars to pay off his Treasury Branch loansI was reading

According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest
on the Treasury Branch loans  Thats a lot of green

somewhere than Pocklington business have gross revenues of about
500 million per yearI dont think he would have much problem
borrowing from his VISA to pay off his Mastercard if he wanted to

Again according to TSN virtually everything that Peter Puck has already 
has liens against it  Of course we cant really be sure of this 

Pocklington is at the point of maximum advantage right nowand
he is basically right in that Northlands which is a creature of the
City of Edmonton must give him a better deal in the era of escalating
salaries  Northlands and the city benefitted as much as he did during
the eighties from the Oilersand wealth generated by the Oilers
success was sharedbut the finanical viability of small market teams
has radically changed in the space of a couple of years and for
the Oilers to remain viable and competitive they need much more of
the revenue stream from concessions parking and building advertising
as most every other professional sports franchise in North America
has  What was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now
Northlands sucking the blood out of the Oilers franchise

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal  Sather has spouted this repeatedly  Pocklinton
has a contract with Northlands until 1999  A deal is a deal  Perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets players
such as Gretzky and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he wouldnt be losing money  He has admitted pulling this
money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses 

The Oilers have paid several times over what the Coliseum cost to
build and bring Edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the
world that is essentially pricelessto nickelanddime the Oilers
just so Northlands can use revenue sucked out of the Oilers to 
subsidize their horseracing operations is insanity

I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization  
I cant really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 
he is certainly not entitled to it  Pocklington has sucked revenue
out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests
Pocklington is not to be trusted  I doubt very much that any Oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklingtons stewardship
As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHLer and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or
draft picks
