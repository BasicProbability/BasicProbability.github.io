Subject Re NHL Team Captains
From caldwell8102mtroyalabca

And while we are on the subject has a captain ever been traded 
resigned or been striped of his title during the season Any other 
team captain trivia would be appreciated

Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit
following the 198990 season This was during the offseason though

Theres countless examples of captains being traded Im sure
