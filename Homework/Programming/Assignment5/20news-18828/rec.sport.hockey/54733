Gee what a coincidence He doesnt share my views Perhaps thats why his
name is not on the list to accompany the letter Maybe I should write a 
disclaimer at the end Mr Bettman nota bene Roger Maynard does NOT
agree with this letter I know hed be so worried otherwise

You wouldnt have to put my name at the bottom if you simply appended a 
standard disclaimer that the opinions expressed in your petition in no
way claim to represent the views of either recsporthockey or the internet
as a whole  You have surely seen these disclaimers appended to the postings
of many who work for companies and post on the net  The disclaimers clever
though some of them may be are there for a reason
