Subject Re Wheres Roger

Speaking of Roger and ilk whatever happened to good ol gln  I had him in
my kill file since last years playoffs and now that Ive moved to a new
news reader which doesnt have kill files I find that hes gone  I must
admit however that unlike gln Roger seems to know something about the game
as long as the subject doesnt touch on the Leafs
