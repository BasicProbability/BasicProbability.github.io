I am postive someone will correct me if I am wrong but doesnt the Fifth
also cover not being forced to do actions that are selfincriminating


From Mike Godwin mnemonicefforg posted with permission  Carl

Sadly it does not Suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and
voice exemplars and to take blood and DNA tests

 eg The police couldnt demand that you silently take them to where the
 body is buried or where the money is hidden

No but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where as it
happens evidence that will convict you is stored 

The cryptokey disclosure issue hasnt come up yet but current law
suggests that its a loser for the defendanthell be compelled to turn
over the key

The test for compelled selfincrimination is whether the material to 
be disclosed in itself tends to inculpate the discloser In the example
I gave above the safe key itself has no testimonial valueergo it can
be disclosed under compulsion eg subpoena duces tecum

Moreover the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
keycompelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you Of course they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you
