 All I have to say isyeah right  If youre willing to pay them
 mucho big bucks andor use the routines they tell you to do  
 Doesnt sound very reasonable to me

All I have to say is this is full of shit  I have negotiated a license
and the bucks are incredibly reasonable with an upfront charge on a
sliding scale depending on your capitalization  If you are a startup
and cant afford it you cant afford to start up in the first place
Why do people insist on making unequivocal statements about that which
they know nothing

 
 But I dont guess PKP and RSA are interested in big bucks  Maybe
 they have some other agenda  Secure communications only for 
 government agents perhaps

Have you considered treatment for paranoia  The government is the
single biggest thorn in RSAs side

 
 Some limitation  Let me guess  dont use the code in any way PKP or
 RSA doesnt likesuch asproviding secure communications for the
 average citizen

That was exactly its purpose if you know anything about it  There is
nothing at all preventing the average citizen using it only selling
it

 
 I hope my cynicism is misplaced here  Go aheadIm not afraid to
 be wrong every once in a while  But I have an uneasy feeling that I
 am right  

It is and you are wrong yet you emotionally state a bunch of crap as fact
with a tiny disclaimer at the end  Check your facts first and grow up
Why is there such a strong correlation between interest in cryptography
and immaturity I wonder
