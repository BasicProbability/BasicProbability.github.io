41 What UNIX programs are related to privacy

  For more information type man cmd or apropos keyword at the
  UNIX shell prompt

    passwd  change password
    finger  obtain information about a remote user
    chfn    change information about yourself obtainable by remote
             users sometimes passwd f
    chmod   change the rights associated with a file or directory
    umask   shell change the default on creation file access
             rights
    ls      list the rights associated with files and directories
    xhost   allow or disable access control of particular users to an
             Xwindow server
    last    list the latest user logins on the system and their
             originations
    who     list other users loginidle times originations
    w       list other users and what they are running
    xhost   access control list for X Window client use
    xauth   control X Window server authentication
    
    signature   file in the home directory appended to USENET posts
    forward     file used to forward email to other accounts
    Xauthority  file used for X Window server authentication keys
    SIGNATURE   variable used for name in email and USENET postings

  The tcpdump packettracing program is loosely based on SMIs
  etherfind although none of the etherfind code remains  It was
  originally written by Van Jacobson Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
  as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve
  tcp and internet gateway performance  A current version is
  available via anonymous ftp from host ftpeelblgov currently at

  From the RIPEM FAQ by Marc VanHeyningen
  mvanheynwhalecsindianaedu on newsanswers

   RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail PEM
   using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES  It allows
   your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication
   ie who sent it can be confirmed and privacy ie nobody can
   read it except the intended recipient
   
   RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan
   mrrscss3clmsuedu Most of the code is in the public domain
   except for the RSA routines which are a library called RSAREF
   licensed from RSA Data Security Inc
   
   RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent
   residents in the US from rsacom cd to rsaref and read the
   README file for info
   
   RIPEM as well as some other crypt stuff has its home site on
   rpubclmsuedu which is open to nonanonymous FTP for users in
   the US and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents  To
   find out how to obtain access ftp there cd to pubcrypt and
   read the file GETTINGACCESS

  Note cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet
  and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it


43 What is the cypherpunks mailing list

  Eric Hughes hughestoadcom runs the cypherpunk mailing list
  dedicated to discussion about technological defenses for privacy
  in the digital domain  Send email to
  cypherpunksrequesttoadcom to be added or subtracted from the
  list From the charter

   The most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption
   To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy  But to encrypt
   with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
   privacy Cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will
   learn how best to defend it

410 What is the MIT CROSSLINK anonymous message TV program

   CROSSLINK is an anonymous message system run on MIT Student
   Cable TV36 It provides an anonymous medium through which MIT
   students can say those things they might otherwise find
   difficult inconvenient or impossible to say in person  Its
   also a way to send fun or totally random messages to your
   friends over the air  It is similar to the anonymous message
   pages found in many college newspapers except that its
   electronic in nature and its free

  Messages can be posted to the service via email  For more

51 What is digital cash

  With digital encryption and authentication technologies the
  possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
  realized  A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
  similar to todays checking system except entirely digital may
  be one approach  The issues of cryptography privacy and
  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
  economy  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum
  Dec1992

  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus
  elee9sfMenudoUHEDU based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the
  cypherpunks mailing list  To use the server send mail to
  elee7h5rosebudeeuhedu message with the following text

    
    command help
    
    userhost

  where userhost is your email address
 
  

52 What is a hacker or cracker

  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning
  especially on the internet  In the general news media in the past
  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as
  breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most
  internet users prefer the term cracker for this  Instead a
  hacker is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious
  curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
  system for examplesomething of a proud electronic pioneer and
  patriot  This is the sense intended in this document  See also
  the Hackers Dictionary and the FAQ altsecurityfaq
 
 

53 What is a cypherpunk

  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list

   Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were
   more of it  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy
   must create it for themselves and not expect governments
   corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant
   them privacy out of beneficence  Cypherpunks know that people
   have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers
   envelopes closed doors and couriers  Cypherpunks do not seek
   to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or
   their opinions

  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below

  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary
  in sodaberkeleyedupubcypherpunks


54 What is steganography and anonymous pools

  Closely associated with encryption is steganography or the
  techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication
  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself 
  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
  proliferation of computer technology  For example it is possible
  to encode messages in the leastsignificant bits of images
  typically the most noisy In addition when such an item is
  posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually
  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and
  receiver  For  steganographic communications in the electronic
  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
  users decode particular messages with their unique key   An
  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman
  mironextropiawimseycom for experiments  Send email to
  pool0requestextropiawimseycom  with one of the following
  commands in the subject line

    subscribe
    unsubscribe
    help


55 What is security through obscurity

  Security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain
  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
  or programs relating to them  For example a company may not make
  public information on its softwares encryption techniques to evade
  attacks based on knowledge of it Another example would be
  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
  operating systems  Or some reliance may be made on the fact that
  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
  because they are not widely known or not widely used This
  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet
  posting forgery Security through obscurity is regarded as a
  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
  worst also called the headinthesand approach See the FAQ
  for altsecurity  
  
  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow cofounder of the Electronic
  Frontier Foundation directed to NSA agents at the First
  International Symposium on National Security  National
  Competitiveness held in McLean Virginia  Dec 1 1992

   Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep
   contained  This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile  Its
   almost a life form in its ability to selfpropagate  If
   something hits the Net and its something which people on there
   find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind  I
   believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into
   an environment where any information which is at all interesting
   to people is going to get out  And there will be very little
   that you can do about it  This is not a bad thing in my view
   but you may differ


56 What are identity daemons
  
  RFC931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to
  query a remote users login name after connection to a local
  communication socket a connection of this type is established
  during FTP and TELNET sessions for example  The standard is not
  widely supported perhaps 10 of internet sites currently implement
  it but the number is increasing  The mechanism is detrimental to
  anonymity  Regular users cannot disable it but system
  adminstrators can circumvent it  This standard may represent a
  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms


57 What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy


  RemailingPosting
  
  
   Stable secure protected officially sanctioned and permitted
    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs
   Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET
    postings
   Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms chaining
    encrypted addresses etc
   Standards for anonymous email addressing embedding files and
    remailer site chaining
  
  General
  
  
   Recognition of anonymity cryptography and related privacy
    shields as legitimate useful desirable and crucial by the
    general public and their governments
   Widespread use and implementation of these technologies 
    by systems designers into
    hardware software and standards implemented securely
    seamlessly and transparently
   General shift of use dependence and reliance to means other than
    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
    agencies
   Publicity retraction and dissolution of laws and government
    agencies opposed to privacy replaced by structures dedicated to
    strengthening and protecting it

61 What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF

  From ftpefforgpubEFFmissionstatement

   A new world is arising in the vast web of digital electronic
   media which connect us  Computerbased communication media like
   electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis
   of new forms of community  These communities without a single
   fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an
   electronic frontier
   
   While wellestablished legal principles and cultural norms give
   structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like
   newspapers books and telephones the new digital media do not
   so easily fit into existing frameworks  Conflicts come about as
   the law struggles to define its application in a context where
   fundamental notions of speech property and place take
   profoundly new forms People sense both the promise and the
   threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies
   even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the
   workplace and the home
   
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to help
   civilize the electronic frontier to make it truly useful and
   beneficial not just to a technical elite but to everyone and to
   do this in a way which is in keeping with our societys highest
   traditions of the free and open flow of information and
   communication
  
  EFF was started by the multimillionaire Mitchell Kapor founder of
  Lotus software and John Barlow lyricist for the Grateful Dead
  rock band  A highly publicized endeavor of the organization
  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI
  raid and an accompanying civil suit  see section on Steve
  Jackson Games  The foundation publishes EFF News EFFector
  Online electronically send requests to effnewsrequestefforg
  
  In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee
  with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated
  November 5 1991  Representative  Edward J Markey complemented
  Mitchell Kapor on his insights on the development of a national
  public information infrastructure which were appreciated greatly
  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee complete text in 
  ftpeffcompubpubinfra199112

   we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to
   work with other sectors of the communications industry to create
   a consumeroriented public information network Please let me or
   my staff know what policies you and others in the computer
   industry believe would best serve the public interest in creating
   a reasonably priced widely available network in which
   competition is open and innovation rewarded  I also want to
   learn what lessons from the computer industry over the past ten
   to fifteen years should apply to the current debate on
   structuring the information and communications networks of the
   futureI ask your help in gaining input from the computer
   industry so that the Subcommittee can shape policies that will
   bring this spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship to the
   information services industry

62 Who are Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility CPSR

  The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been
  working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues
  since 1982  The group has three offices Palo Alto Cambridge
  Washington DC and 20 chapters It is involved in  litigation
  against the FBI The NSA NIST the Secret Service and other other
  US government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation
  on issues such as Operation Sundevil the FBI wiretap proposal
  NSAs interference in crypography the breakup of the 2600 raid in
  Arlington Va in Nov 1992 Members speak frequently in front on
  Congress state legislators and public utility commissions to
  testify on privacy information policy computer security and
  caller identification

  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available
  via FTP Gopher WAIS and email at cpsrorg currently comprising
  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet  For

63 What was Operation Sundevil and the Steve Jackson Game case

  In the early 1990s a fear spread among US law enforcement agencies
  on the illicit activities of hackers and phreakers involved in
  such activities as credit card fraud and longdistance call thievery
  
  see ftpefforgpubSJGGeneralInformationEFFector104

   Operation Sundevil the Phoenixinspired crackdown of May
   81990 concentrated on telephone codefraud and creditcard
   abuse and followed this seizure plan with some success 
   Bulletin Board Systems went down all over America terrifying
   the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of
   their criminal instruments  It also saddled analysts with some
   24000 floppy disks and confronted harried Justice Department
   prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide
   hacker showtrial involving highly technical issues in dozens of
   jurisdictions

  Massive showtrials never materialized although isolated
  instances of prosecution were pursued  The movement reached a
  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal
  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of
  Austin Texas on March 1 1990  From the column GURPS LABOUR LOST
  by Bruce Sterling bruceswellsfcaus in Fantasy and Science
  Fiction Magazine

   In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional
   warrant agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the
   SJG office  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared
   for publication private electronic mail and several computers
   including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin
   Board System  Yet Jackson and his business were not only
   innocent of any crime but never suspects in the first place 
   The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that
   somewhere in Jacksons office there might be a document
   compromising the security of the 911 telephone system

  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed
  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier
  Foundation  See information on EFF below  From an article by Joe
  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle Feb 1 1993
  
   AUSTIN  An electronic civil rights case against the Secret
   Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal
   District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a
   proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown
   and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment 
   
   Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago who was in
   charge of three Austin computer searchandseizures on March 1
   1990 that led to the lawsuit stoically endured Sparks rebuke
   over the Services poor investigation and abusive computer
   seizure policies  While the Service has seized dozens of
   computers since the crackdown began in 1990 this is the first
   case to challenge the practice 
   
   Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin
   science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never
   suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal
   research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and
   the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine
   that the company was a publisher Indeed agents testified that
   they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the
   special Secret Service school on computer crime 
   
   How long would it have taken you Mr Foley to find out what
   Steve Jackson Games did what it was asked Sparks An hour 
   
   Was there any reason why on March 2 you could not return to
   Steve Jackson Games a copy in floppy disk form of everything
   taken 
   
   Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had
   a picture of Steve Jackson  a lawabiding taxpaying citizen
    saying he was a computer crime suspect 
   
   Did it ever occur to you Mr Foley that seizing this material
   could harm Steve Jackson economically 
   
   Foley replied No sir but the judge offered his own answer 
   
   You actually did you just had no idea anybody would actually go
   out and hire a lawyer and sue you 
   
   More than 200000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier 
   Foundation in bringing the case to trial The EFF was founded by 
   Mitchell Kapor amid a civil liberties movement sparked in large
   part by the Secret Service computer crime crackdown

64 What is Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN

  ISDN is a highspeed data communications standard that utilizes
  existing copper telephone lines and is a possible inexpensive and
  intermediate alternative to laying fiber optic cable for phone
  networks  The speeds involved may be sufficient for audio and
  video transmission applications  G V der Leun in the file
  ftpefforg pubpubinfra199111

   Telecommunications in the United States is at a crossroads  With
   the Regional Bell Operating Companies now free to provide
   content the shape of the information networking is about to be
   irrevocably altered  But will that network be the open
   accessible affordable network that the American public needs 
   You can help decide this question
   
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation recently presented a plan to
   Congress calling for the immediate deployment of a national
   network based on existing ISDN technology accessible to anyone
   with a telephone connection and priced like local voice service
    We believe deployment of such a platform will spur the
   development of innovative new information services and maximize
   freedom competitiveness and civil liberties throughout the
   nation
   
   The EFF is testifying before Congress and the FCC making
   presentations to public utility commisions from Massachusetts to
   California and meeting with representatives from telephone
   companies publishers consumer advocates and other stakeholders
   in the telecommunications policy debate
   
   The EFF believes that participants on the Internet as pioneers on
   the electronic frontier need to have their voices heard at this
   critical moment

66 What is the FBIs proposed Digital Telephony Act

  Providers of electronic communication services and private branch
  exchange operators shall provide within the United States
  capability and capacity for the government to intercept wire and
  electronic communications when authorized by law
  
  From BBS Legislative Watch FBIs Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted by
  S Steele in Boardwatch Magazine Feb 1993 p 1922
 
   In a move that worried privacy experts software manufacturers and
   telephone companies the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
   Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to
   perform electronic wiretapping The proposed legislation
   entitled Digital Telephony would have required communications
   service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their
   systems tappable by providing back doors through which law
   enforcement officers could intercept communications Furthermore
   this capability would have been provided undetectably while the
   communications was in progress exclusive of any communications
   between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target
   of the FBIs investigation and without degradation of service
    
   under the proposal the Department of Justice DOJ can keep
   communications products off the market if it determines that
   these products do not meet the DOJs own  guidelines This
   could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for
   service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be
   unlikely to add any features that may result in a DOJ rejection
   of their entire product the FBI proposal suggests that the
   cost of this wiretapping service to the Bureau would have to be
   borne by the service provider itself
   
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of
   public interest and industry groups from Computer Professionals
   for Social Responsibilty CPSR and the ACLU to ATT and Sun
   Microsystems to oppose the legislation A white paper produced
   by the EFF and ratified by the coalition entitled An Analysis
   of the FBI Digital Telephony Proposal was widely distributed
   throughout the Congress   The Justice Department lobbied hard
   in the final days to get Congress to take up the bill before
   Congress adjourned but the bill never  found a Congressional
   sponsor and was therefore never officially introduced The FBI
   may reintroduce Digital Telephony when the 103rd Congress
   convenes in January

FOOTNOTES




71 What is the background behind the Internet
 
  The article Internet in Fantasy and Science Fiction by Bruce
  Sterling bruceswellsfcaus contains general and nontechnical
  introductory notes on origins of the Internet including the role
  of the RAND corporation the goal of network resilience in face of
  nuclear attack MIT UCLA ARPANET TCPIP NSF NREN etc

   ARPANET itself formally expired in 1989 a happy victim of its 
   own overwhelming success  Its users scarcely noticed for
   ARPANETs  functions not only continued but steadily improved 
   The use of  TCPIP standards for computer networking is now
   global  In 1971 a  mere twentyone years ago there were only
   four nodes in the  ARPANET  network  Today there are tens of
   thousands of  nodes in  the Internet  scattered over fortytwo
   countries with more coming  online every day   Three million
   possibly four million people use  this gigantic
   motherofallcomputernetworks   
   
   The Internet is especially popular among scientists and is 
   probably the most important scientific instrument of the late 
   twentieth century   The  powerful sophisticated access that it 
   provides to specialized data and personal communication  has sped
   up the pace of scientific research enormously  
   
   The Internets pace of growth in the early 1990s is  spectacular 
   almost ferocious  It is spreading faster than cellular phones
   faster  than fax machines  Last year the Internet was growing at
   a rate of  twenty percent a month  The number of host
   machines with direct  connection to TCPIP has been doubling
   every year since  1988   The Internet is moving out of  its
   original base in military and  research institutions  into
   elementary and high schools as well as into  public libraries
   and the commercial sector

72 How Internet anarchy like the English language

  According to Bruce Sterling bruceswellsfcaus

   The Internets anarchy may seem strange or even unnatural  but
   it makes a certain deep and basic sense  Its rather like the 
   anarchy of the English language  Nobody rents English and
   nobody  owns English    As an Englishspeaking person its up
   to you to learn  how to speak English properly  and make whatever
   use you please  of it though the government provides certain
   subsidies to help you  learn to read and write a bit  
   Otherwise everybody just sort of  pitches in and somehow the
   thing evolves on its own and somehow  turns out workable  And
   interesting   Fascinating even   Though a lot  of people earn
   their living from using and exploiting  and teaching  English
   English as an institution is public property a public good  
   Much the same goes for the Internet   Would English  be improved
   if  the The English Language Inc  had a board of directors
   and a chief  executive officer or a President and a Congress  
   Thered probably be  a lot fewer new words in English and a lot
   fewer new ideas
