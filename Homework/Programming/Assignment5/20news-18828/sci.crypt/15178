81 What are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites

  Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
  is anonpenetfi operated by julfpenetfi for several months who
  has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment 
  Including anonymized mail Usenet posting and return addresses 
  no encryption  Send mail to helppenetfi for information
 
  Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
  remailers on the ftp site sodaberkeleyedu 1283214919

    address for information

  Notes
  
  
   Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
    running without site administrator knowledge Liability issues
    are wholly unresolved
  
   So far all encryption is based on publickey cryptography and PGP
    software see the question on cryptography 

   Encryption aspects message text destination address replies
    vary between sites

   Multiple chaining alias unlinking and address encryption are
    mostly untested problematic or unsupported at this time


82 What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity

  
  Users
  

   Use anonymity only if you have to Frivolous uses weaken the
    seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others
   Do not use anonymity to provoke harass or threaten others
   Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
    Usenet  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups
   If posting large files be attentive to bandwidth considerations
    Remember simply sending the posting to the service increases
    network traffic
   Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet this
    is the mostly likely place to alienate readers The alt
    hierarchy is preferred
   Give as much information as possible in the posting ie
    references etc Remember that content is the only means for
    readers to judge the truth of the message and that any
    inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
    future ones under the same handle
   Be careful not to include information that will reveal your
    identity or enable someone to deduce it  Test the system by
    sending anonymized mail to yourself
   Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them 
    Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege
   Be considerate and respectful of others objections to anonymity
   Hitandrun anonymity should be used with utmost reservation
    Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead
   Be courteous to the system operator who may have invested large
    amounts of time be personally risking his account or dedicating
    his hardware all for your convenience

  Operators
  

   Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
    introductory file that is sent to new users  Have a coherent and
    consistent policy and stick to it State clearly what logging and
    monitoring is occurring Describe your background interest and
    security measures Will the general approach be totalitarian or
    lassaizfaire
   Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
    potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas What if a user
    is blackmailing someone through your service What if a user
    posts suicidal messages through your service Remember your
    users trust you to protect them
   In the site introductory note give clear examples  of situations
    where you will take action and what these actions will be eg
    warn the user limit anonymity to email or posting only revoke
    the account out the user contact local administrator etc
   Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware
    Address the bandwidth limitations of your site Report candidly
    and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred  Work closely with
    users to isolate and fix bugs Address all bugs noted below under
    instability of anonymity
   Document the stability of the sitehow long has it been running
    What compromises have occured Why are you running it What is
    your commitment to it
   Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages  Include an
    address for complaints ideally appended to every outgoing item 
    Consult a lawyer about your liability
   Be committed to the longterm stability of the site Be prepared
    to deal with complaints and hate mail addressed to you  If you
    do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
    adminstrator consult those who do and are
   Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups  If
    possible query group readers
   Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
    format that can be screened effectively by kill files  Ensure
    the key text Anon is  somewhere in every header
   Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
    physical and  networkbased attacks and infiltrations

  Readers
  
  
   Do not complain attack or discredit a poster for the sole reason
    that he is posting anonymously make blanket condemnations that
    equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality or assail
    anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons eg its
    volume is heavy or increasing
   React to the anonymous information unemotionally  Abusive posters
    will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
    responses  Sometimes the most effective response is silence
   Notify operators if very severe abuses occur such as piracy
    harassment extortion etc
   Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they
    offend you personally
   Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
    idea of anonymity itself
   Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
    should be barred from particular groups because no possible or
    conceivable need exists

   This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual
   privacy and the use of handles  It accepts the need of a system
   operator to know the name of a user but suggests that the use of
   a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a
   letter to the editor The article concludes with a set of
   guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous


83 How do I kill anonymous postings

  James Thomas Green jgreenzeuscalpolyedu

   Try putting this in your kill file
     
     Anonhj
     Anonymoushj
   
   This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that
   contain Anon or Anonymous in them  Not perfect and wont
   kill followups 
  
  Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
  anonymous postings under which the above method will not work so
  far this practice is not widespread but it may become more common
  as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering
  

84 What is the history behind anonymous posting servers

  Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
  individual particularly volatile newsgroups where anonymity is
  almost the preferred method of communication such as talkabortion
  and altsexbondage  One of the first was one by Dave Mack
  started in 1988 for altsexbondage Another early one was
  wizvaxmethuenmaus run by Stephanie Gilgut Gilgut Enterprises
  but was disbanded due to  lack of funds  The system provided
  anonymous return addresses n7kbtraincom John Opalko took up
  the functions of this server including reinstating the anonymous
  alias file The group altpersonals has been chewing through
  servers like theres no tomorrow
  
  Spurred by the disappearance of wizvax and interested in
  researching the idea Karl Kleinpaste
  KarlKleinpastegodivanectarcscmuedu developed his own system
  from scratch in six hours By this time the idea of extending the
  server to new more mainstream  groups was starting to emerge
  and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by
  multiple users for anonymity in other groups The intended
  advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
  support with a single anon identifier across all  This was
  arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems 
  K Kleinpaste posted a message on recnude asking users whether an
  anonymous service would be welcome there and judged a consensus
  against it 

  K Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a fire extinguisher to
  squelch or plonk abusive users in response to complaints and
  used this in three cases Nevertheless after a few months of
  intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
  server Even as restricted as it was my system was subjected to
  abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the
  facilities staff here Such abuses started right after it was
  created

  In Nov 1992 Johan Helsingius julfpenetFI set up the most
  controversial anonymous site to date anonpenetfi is based on
  scripts and C code written by K Kleinpaste and supports anonymized
  mail posting and return addresses He initially wanted to confine
  the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
  accessability in response to lots of international requests
  
  J Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet
  newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
  opposition eg by news adminstrators in newsadminpolicy
  Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium
  abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than
  routine abuses His total commitment to preservation of
  anonymity is also controversial

  For example in a highly controversial and publicized case in Feb
  1993  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
  crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via
  anonpenetfi to sciastro Despite that the transcript had been
  posted in the same place up to a year earlier then
  nonanonymously and actually originated not with the poster but a
  New York news tabloid subsequent responses consisted largely of
  vociferous outrage at the posters use of anonymity reverberating
  through many newsgroups 
  
  The original poster using the same anonymous handle later conceded
  that the story seemed likely to have been fabricated
  suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
  not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
  the story albeit crudely free of personal risk from perceived
  association with the item  The ensuing commotion generated queries
  for the original article by lateentering readers The anonymous
  user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
  detractors

  Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints and even the vocal
  opposition and verbal abuse of K Kleinpaste and eminent news
  operators J Helsingius has largely avoided use of the fire
  extingisher and the group bouncer mechanisms that limit the
  scope of the service As of March 1993 the anonpenetfi site is
  best described as inundated it has registered over 13000 users
  in its initial three months of operation forwards 3000 messages a
  day and approximately 5 of all Usenet postings are anonymized
  through the site The immense popularity is probably largely due
  to the capability for global anonymity which has allowed users to
  find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned

  Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to
  dismantle his server in Feb 1993 At one point K Kleinpaste
  threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
  news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages
  originating from the site  J Helsingius has also alluded to
  threats of flooding the  server  The server has crashed several
  times at least once due to a saturation mailbombing through it
  by an anonymous user  Mr Helsingius reports spending up to 5
  hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the
  services administration In response to the serious threats he
  disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
  encouraged his users to defend the service publicly
  
  Based on fastmoving dialogue and creative suggestions by
  cypherpunks J Helsingius has identified many security
  weaknesses and valuable new features for the service and is
  currently in the process of code development and testing He is
  planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon
  to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new
  system with very sophisticated functionality including multiple
  email aliases alias allocation control publickey encryption
  etc

  A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec
  1992 by D Clunie dcluniepaxtpacomau that used cryptography
  in both directions tofrom the server for the highest degree of
  confidentiality seen so far  However it was running on a public
  access account and he had to shut it down after only several
  weeks upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
  originating from NSF representatives D Clunie has released the
  software to the public domain

  Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to whistleblowing on
  government abuses has received wide and focused attention and
  group formation is currently underway  In the basic scenario the
  group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers
  and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable
  digital signatures The traffic may eventually reach reporters in
  the mainstream news media  deltortoaolcom has volunteered to
  attack multiple aspects of this project including distributing
  easytoread documentation on posting anonymization and
  encryption

85 What is the value of anonymity

  KONDAREDPURCCVMBITNET
    
   I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the
   content of ones message Sure lot of anonymous posts are abusive
   or frivolous but in most cases these are by users who find the
   anon facility novel Once the novelty wears off they are stopping
   their pranks

  morganengrukyedu Wes Morgan

   I dont mind seeing the miscellaneous hatredprejudiceracism
   those things are part of our nature  However  the notion of
   providing anonymitys shield for these ideas repulses me  If
   they have such strong feelings why cant they put their names
   on  their postings  Quite frankly I loathe communication
   with people who refuse to use their names

  dcluniepaxtpacomau David Clunie
   
   Many seem to question the value of anonymity But who are they to
   say what risks another individual should take  There is no
   question that in this rather conservative society that we live
   in holding certain views making certain statements adopting a
   certain lifestyle are likely to result in public censure
   ridicule loss of status employment or even legal action Given
   the heterogeneity of the legal jurisdictions from where the many
   contributors to usenet post who knows what is legal and what is
   not  Some say that anonymous posters are cowards and should
   stand up and be counted Perhaps that is one point of view but
   what right do these detractors have to exercise such censorship 

  From dougccysuedu Doug Sewell
  
   Why is it censorship to not expect someone to speak for
   themselves without the cloak of anonymity This is at best a
   lame argument 
   
   You tell me why what you have to say requires anonymity  And you
   tell me why the wishes of a majority of nonanonymous users of a
   newsgroup should be disregarded when they dont want anonymous
   posts
   
   Anonymous users have LESS rights than any others They are not
   legitimate usenet participants I would not honor RFDs CFVs
   control messages or votes from one

  bradclarinetcom Brad Templeton
  
   I can think of no disadvantage caused by anon posting sites that
   doesnt already exist other than the fact that they do make more
   naive net users who dont know how to post anonymously the old
   way more prone to do it

  From mandelnetcomcom Tom Mandel
  
   I cannot speak for others but I regard anonymous postings in a
   serious discussion as pretty much worthless  views that hide 
   behind the veil of anon are hardly worth the trouble of reading
  
  n8729anonpenetfi Hank Pankey
  
   Since I began posting anonymously to show support for general
   principles of personal privacy I have been subject to far more
   abuse and attack than I ever received before People seem to
   find it easier to flame and insult someone whose name they dont
   know Perhaps its easier to pretend that there is no person
   behind the email address who feels the sting of abusive comments
   
   Anonymity does hinder some methods of controlling other posters
   actions  People who seek such control will naturally oppose it

  From 00acearlleobsuvcbsuedu
  
   Instead of making this a freeer medium by allowing posters to
   protect themselves with anonymity simply require that all
   posters be prepared to discuss their sources of information and
   take the heat for unsubstantiated dribble  This seems to be the
   way things are currently done 

  xtkmgtrentuca Kate Gregory
  
   In misckids there are three threads going on started by anonymous
   posters One was about changing jobs so as to work less hours
   job sharing and so on from a woman who didnt want anyone at her
   current place of work to know she was thinking of looking for
   work elsewhere The next was from a woman who is thinking of
   having a baby sometime soon and doesnt want coworkers friends
   family etc etc to know all about it but who wants advice The
   third is about sex after parenthood  actually this was started
   by people posting in the usual way but then it was pointed out
   that the anonymous posting service might let more people
   participate
   
   Misckids doesnt seem to be suffering any harm from the presence
   of anonymous posters in fact it seems to have been helped by it

  hoeyzogwargetlarmymil Dan Hoey
  
   While there has never been any real security against anonymous or
   forged postings on Usenet the process has until now been
   sufficiently inconvenient errorprone and undocumented to limit
   its use by persons who have not learned the culture of the net
  
   On the other hand a recent use of the anonymous posting service
   on scimath seemed seemed to be a student asking help on a
   homework problem It has now been attributed to a teacher
   asking for an explanation of a dubious answer in his teaching
   guide  He says his news posting is broken so he is using the
   anonymous service as a mailtonews gateway

  Karl Barrus elee9sfMenudoUHEDU
   
   Some argue that the opinions of the people who hide behind a veil
   of anonymity are worthless and that people should own up to
   their thoughts  I agree with the latter point  in an ideal
   world we would all be sitting around engaging in Socratic
   dialogues freely exchanging our opinions in an effort to
   learn  But in an ideal world nobody will threaten you for your
   thoughts or ridicule you
   
   But we live in a world where the people who dont agree with you
   may try to harm you  Lets face it some people arent going to
   agree with your opinion no matter how logically you try to
   present it or how reasoned out it may be  This is sad since it
   does restrict people from voicing their opinions

  redredpollneoucomedu Richard E Depew

   The consensus seems to be that a general anonymous posting service
   such as that at anonpenetfi seems sufficiently corrosive of the
   trust and civility of the net that this particular experiment
   should be ended  Perhaps the next time the question comes up we
   can say We tried it  we learned it does more harm than good 
   and we stopped it 

  From C96vmurzuniheidelbergde Alexander EICHENER

   anonymous posting has not created major problems aside from
   angering irate people like you who would rather ban
   anonymouspseudonymous posting altogether because real men can
   stand up for what they said or comparable puerile arguments as
   others have brought up

  daveelxrjplnasagov Dave Hayes

   What a primal example of human nature I have three questions for
   you folks 
   
   Do people really say different things to each other based upon
   whether their identity is or isnt known
   
   Are people really so affected by what other people say that the
   verbage is labeled abuse
   
   Most importantly on a forum that prizes itself on the freedom of
   communication that it enjoys is there really such a thing as
   freedom of communication
  
  From terrygeovisiongvccom Terry McGonigal
  
   sigh  Just how many anon services are needed  Will
   everybody start running one soon  Whats the purpose  Who
   stands to benefit when there are N anon services then 2N then
   N2 out there  Where has this sudden fasination with anon
   services come from
   
   For better or IMHO worse it looks like weer gonna get stuck
   with these things and as much as I dont like the idea of
   services like this becoming the norm I dont really think
   theres much to be done since its obvious that anyone who wants
   to can set one up with a bit of work

  KarlKleinpastecscmuedu Karl Kleinpaste

   Weak reasoning
   With freedom comes responsibility

  daveelxrjplnasagov Dave Hayes
  
   Responsibility isnt real if it is enforced True responsibilty
   comes with no coercion 


86 Should anonymous posting to all groups be allowed

  morganengrukyedu Wes Morgan
  
   I will be the first to admit that I hold some controversial
   opinions indeed Im sure that none of us are completely
   orthodox in our opinions However  Ive received hundreds of
   anonymous email messages over the last few years fewer than 20
   of them were reasonable posts made with good motives Its 
   getting more and more difficult to remember why we need anonymity
   at all the abusers are once again lousing things up for those
   who truly need the service  or those who would put it to good
   use
   
   Im not suggesting that we should ban anonymous servers as Ive
   said there are several situations in which anonymity is a Good
   Thing tm 
   
   However the notion that anonymitys shield should be
   automatically extended to every Usenet discussion is ridiculous
   it opens the door to further abuse 

  twpierceunixamherstedu Tim Pierce
  
   Of course how does one determine whether a group requests the
   service  A flat majority of posters voting in favor A positive
   margin of 100 votes  Or what  No one speaks for a newsgroup
   
   Im not convinced by the arguments that an anonymous posting
   service for all newsgroups is inherently a bad idea simply
   because its a diversion from the status quo Since the status
   quo previously permitted anonymous posting to no newsgroups
   any anonymous posting service would reject the status quo
  
  hartmanulogicUUCP Richard M Hartman writes
  
   It is facist to suggest that a newsgroup is best able to decide
   whether it wants to allow anonymous postings instead of having
   them forced upon them by an service administrator

  ogilquadsuchicagoedu Brian W Ogilvie

   The service provides a mechanism for forwarding mail to the
   original poster Since most Usenet readers dont know John Smith
   from Jane Doe except by their opinions and their address the
   effect of having an anonymous posting to which mail replies can
   be directed is minimal except for those who personally know the
   posterand  the lack of anonymity could be serious Any
   mechanism like this is liable to abuse but the benefits as well
   as the costs must be weighed Limiting the service to alt groups
   or specific groups would not help those who want advice on
   sensitive issues in more professional newsgroups

  From tarlswstratuscom Tarl Neustaedter
  
   An additional point is that some of us find anonimity in technical
   matters to be profoundly offensive anonimity in different forums
   has different meanings If I get a phone call from someone who
   wont identify himself I hang up If I get US mail with no
   return address it goes into the garbage unopened If someone
   accosts me in the street while wearing a mask I back away 
   carefully and expecting violence In a technical discussion
   anonimity means that the individual isnt willing to associate
   himself with the matter being discussed which discredits his
   utterances and makes listening to them a waste of time
     
   Anonimity leads to fun psych experiments the literature is filled
   with all the various things that people will do anonymously that
   they wont otherwise Including one notorious study involving
   torture that would not have passed todays ethical standards Fun
   stuff in any case
   
   FINE LEAVE US OUT OF IT

  From jbuckforneyberkeleyedu Joe Buck

   You obviously have never submitted an article to a refereed
   journal where you will receive anonymous reviews through a server
   the editor that behaves much like the one in Finland eg you 
   may reply and the editor will maintain the anonymity    Your
   comparison of someone who wants to express himherself on a 
   technical issue anonymously with a person who approaches you on a 
   dark street with a ski mask is just emotionally overwrought 
   nonsense such posters pose no physical threat to you
 
  jikmitedu J Kamens
  
   It seems obvious to me that the default should be not to allow
   anonymous postings in a newsgroup  The Usenet has always
   operated on the principle that the status quo should be kept
   unless theres a large number of people who want to change it
   
   If someone REALLY needs to post a message anonymous in a newsgroup
   in which this usually isnt done they can usually find someone
   on the net to do this for them They dont need an automated
   service to do it and the automated service is by its nature
   incapable of making the judgment call necessary to decide whether
   a particular posting really needs to be anonymous

  From twpierceunixamherstedu Tim Pierce
  
   For any newsgroup you name I bet I can envision a scenario
   involving a need for secrecy If an accurate contentbased
   filter of each anonymous posting could be devised to screen out
   those that dont require secrecy wonderful  But it cant be
   done

  From lhpdaimiaaudk Lasse Hillere Petersen
  
   If a newsgroup wants to be noise and nuisancefree then it
   should call for moderation This should happen on a pernewsgroup
   basis and not as a general USENET ban on anonymous postings Of
   course one principle of moderation might be to keep out all
   anonymous postings and could be achieved automatically It would
   still be moderation Personally I would prefer moderation
   criteria being based on actual content

  David A Clunie dcluniepaxtpacomau
  
   If a group doesnt want to receive certain posts it should
   become moderated  there are clearly defined mechanisms on
   nonalt groups for this to take place An automated moderator
   excluding posts from certain eg anonymous sites or individuals
   could easily be established If anyone wants to take such a
   draconian approach then they are welcome to do so and good luck
   to them I doubt if I will be reading their group 

  From davefrackitUUCP Dave Ratcliffe
  
   What possible need would someone have for posting anonymously to a
   sci group 
   
   Sure most adults are willing to post under their own names Why
   would they want to hide behind an anonymous posting service
   Ashamed of what they have to say or just trying to rile people
   without fear of being identified 
   
   Anonymous posting have their place in CERTAIN groups If I or
   anyone else needs to tell you what those groups are then youve
   been on another planet breathing exotic gases for too long

  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   Its bloody fascinating that all the proponents of unimpeded
   universal anon posting access cant seem to find any middle
   ground at all  Why is there such a perception of
   absolutism Where does this instant gratification syndrome come
   from I want anon access and I want it NOW  Who are the
   control freaks here
  
  From 00acearlleobsuvcbsuedu

   Remember this is a newsgroup for posters writing about SCIENTIFIC
   issues Anonymous discussion of scientific issues leads to bad
   science

  From noringnetcomcom Jon Noring
  
   Though many have personal philosophical arguments against
   anonymous posters their arguments have not been compelling
   enough to convince me that omninewsgroup anonymous posting
   should be banned or severely restricted  Though I cannot prove
   it it seems to me that those who do not like anonymous posting
   in principle do so for reasons that are personal read
   psychological discomfort rather than for reasons related to
   maintaining the integrity of Usenet
   
   Remember it is impossible to be able to ascertain all the
   conceivable and legitimate motives for anonymous posting to
   newsgroups one normally would not deem to be sensitive  in
   general I fear even letting newsgroup readers vote on either
   allowing or not allowing anonymous posting since a priori they
   cannot know all the motives of legitimate posters and I do
   not believe that any system should ever be instituted that would
   inhibit the posting of legitimate and informative posts 

  lestatwixercactusorg Lyle J Mackey writes

   I personally dont believe that pseudonymous postings are
   appropriate in a serious discussion area  If there is a
   LEGITIMATE reason for concealing the posters identity perhaps
   but simply because theyre not so sure if they want their name
   attached doesnt qualify as LEGITIMATE in my book  Oh and if
   you can come up with a legitimate purpose for anonymous postings
   please enlighten me

  sderbycrickssctrbcmtmcedu Stuart P Derby
  
   Three of our the USs founding fathers Madison Hamilton and
   Jay seemed to think anonymous posting was OK The Federalist
   papers were originally printed in New York newspapers with
   authorship attributed to Publius I wonder if you would find
   their purpose LEGITIMATE



87 What should system operators do with anonymous postings

  From emcguireintellectioncom Ed McGuire
  
   I would like to know how to junk all articles posted by the
   anonymous service currently being discussed  Ideally I would
   actually tell my feed site not to feed me articles posted by the
   anonymous service Assuming the C News Performance Release what
   is a simple way to accomplish this Or where should I look to
   learn how to do it myself
  
  From dcluniepaxtpacomau David Clunie
  
   Thats a bit draconian isnt it  Have your users unanimously
   decided that they would like you to do this or have you decided
   for them 
  
  From emcguireintellectioncom Ed McGuire
  
   Good question  Nobody has decided I have no definite plan to do
   this just wanted the technical data

  Carl Kleinpaste KarlKleinpastegodivanectarcscmuedu
  
   were I to be in the position of offering such a service again
   my promises of protection of anonymity would be limited  Not on
   the basis of personal opinion of what gets posted but on the
   basis of postings which disrupt the smooth operation of the
   Usenet The most obvious and direct recourse would be to out
   the abusive individual Less drastic possibilities exist  the
   software supports a fire extinguisher by which individuals can
   be prevented from posting

  johniastateedu John Hascall
  
   Since when is Usenet a democracy If someone wants to run an
   anonymous service thats their business If you want to put
   that host in your killfile thats your business If a newsadmin
   wants to blanketdrop all postings from that site thats between
   them and the other people at that site If everyone ignores a
   service the service effectively doesnt exist

  From jikathenamitedu Jonathan I Kamens
  
   NNTP servers that allow posting from anyone are NOT a service to
   the net  They do the net a disservice
   
   Terminal servers have the same problems as open NNTP servers 
   they allow people who want to do illegalimmoralunethical things
   on the Internet to do so without accountability
   
   There are by now public access sites all over this country if
   not all over the world that allow very inexpensive access to the
   Usenet and the Internet  There is no reason for NNTP servers to
   allow anyone to post messages through them and there is no
   reason for terminal servers to allow anyone to connect to them
   and then make outbound connections through them  Perhaps when it
   was harder to get to the Internet or the Usenet open servers
   could be justified but not now

  jbotzmtholyokeedu Jurgen Botz 
  
   I think that what  these points show clearly is that an
   anonymous posting service has a great deal of responsibility
   both towards its clients and towards the Net as a whole  Such a
   service should IMHO have a set of welldefined rules and a
   contract that its clients should sign under the terms of which
   they are assured anonymity

  From an8785anonpenetfi
  
   Is the problem that some are used to punishing posters who are
   upsetting in some vague way by complaining to the usually
   acquiescent sysadmin or organizations that the poster belongs
   to That surely is the most gutless approach to solving
   problems but my experience on the net shows that the same users
   who vilify anonymous postings are the first to write obsessively
   detailed grievances to the posters supervisor when his or her
   tranquility is disturbed by some intrusive or subversive post
   or another
   
   Anonymous postings prevent just this kind of intimidation

  From gandalfcyberspaceorg Eric Schilling
  
   The main point I would like to make here is that while we can go
   through and revise the news sw to reject anon posts to technical
   newsgroups or some such thing I think the attempt will prove
   futile Each attempt to modify news can result in a changed
   approach by anon service providers to thwart the change  I think
   this would be pointless

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius

   I have tried to stay out of this discussion and see where the
   discussion leads But now I rally feel like I have to speak up
    I have repeatedly made clear  that I do block users if
   they continue their abuse after having been warned In many cases
   the users have taken heed of the warning and stopped and in some
   cases even apologized in public And when the warning has not had
   the desired effect I have blocked a number of users I have also
   blocked access to groups where the readership has taken a vote to
   ban anonymous postings although I feel changing the newsgroup
   status to moderated is the only permanent solution for newsgroups
   that want to formalize discussion
 
  redredpollneoucomedu Richard E Depew

   Does this  mean that you are volunteering to issue a Request 
   For Discussion to ban anonymous postings or to moderate each of 
   the 4000 newsgroups that your server can reach  I dont think 
   so but this illustrates the trouble that your server is causing
  
   please listen to the consensus of the news administrators in this 
   group  any newsgroup should be consulted before letting your 
   server post messages to that group
 
  From C96vmurzuniheidelbergde Alexander EICHENER
  
   There is no pompous consensus of the news administrators 
   here  maybe you would like to invent one There is a sizeable 
   number of people who are concerned about the possible and to a 
   minor extent about the actual abuse of the server as it is 
   configured now These concerns are respectable Johan is dealing
   with them  There are some few who rage with foam before 
   their mouth and condemn the service altogether And a number who
   defend it pointing out like Kate Gregory that even a group 
   like misckids can benefit from pseudonymous postings

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius

   I have answered a lot of personal mail related to server abuse
   and as a result of that blocked a number of abusive users I
   have also withdrawn the service from several newsgroups where the
   users have taken a vote on the issue I have not made any
   comments on newsadminpolicy partly because the
   newlyimplemented password feature as a emergency measure
   against a security hole has kept me really busy answering user
   queries the last two weeks and partly because I feel it is not
   for me to justify the service but for the users The problem
   with newsadminpolicy is that the readership is rather elective
   representing people whith a strong interest in centralised
   control

  From hartmanulogicUUCP Richard M Hartman
  
   This seems to be a rather bigoted attitude  I would consider that
   this group is for anyone who wishes to discuss how the net should
   be controlled  Saying that we only have an interest in
   centralized control is a clear indication of bias  You are
   perfectly welcome to join in the discussions here to promote your
   views on control

  jbuckohmberkeleyedu
  
   This whole debate is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing
   because even if you all decide to ban anonymous posting servers
   it is not enforceable  The only people who conceivably could
   enforce retrictions are those that control the international
   links
   
   Policy changes should be made by cooperation not by attempting
   to dictate you need to persuade those who run the services
   to act like this through friendly persuasion not by trying to
   beat them over the head with a stick especially a stick you
   dont even have

  sppzabriskieberkeleyedu Steve Pope
  
   I am finding this bias against pseudonymity boring  Our friend
   posting through penet has a point  The old guard would like to
   keep their network the way it always has been and this new
   thing these pseudonymous servers cuts into their turf  So they
   whine and bitch about it and every time theres the slightest
   abuse such as somebodys sig being too long  they try to
   parlay that into an argument against pseudonymity
   
   Ill go on record as saying three cheers for the admins at anon
   servers like penet pax and n7kbt and for all the  access
   service providers who are willing to preserve their clients
   privacy
   
   And a pox on those who try to defeat and restrict pseudonymity
  
  mimirsteinuwashingtonedu Al Billings
  
   I wouldnt help people get rid of anon postings as a group If you
   dont like what someone says then you put THAT anon address in
   your kill file not all of them Of course if and when I get an
   anon site going Im just going to assign fake names like
   jsmith instead of anon5564 to avoid most of the hassles
   Youll never know it is anonymous will you

  From annealcorconcordiaca Anne Bennett
  
   I must admit to some astonishment at this argument  I see the
   value of anonymous postings under some circumstances yet believe
   strongly that these should be identified as such so that people
   who do not wish to read material from people who wont identify
   themselves dont have to
   
   I fail to see what good you would be accomplishing and indeed
   surmise that you will cause many people inconvenience and
   annoyance by hiding the anonymity of postings from your
   anonymous site  Would you care to justify where the hell you get
   the gall to try to prevent people from effectively filtering
   their news as they see fit
  
  From dcluniepaxtpacomau David Clunie
  
   I thought I was out of reach here in Australia too Unfortunately
   one of the US sites involved in the USAus feed complained to the
   Australian Academic Reasearch Network through whom my site is
   connected not about anything in particular just the concept of
   anonymous mail having no redeeming features and consuming a
   narrow bandwidth link with which I cant argue and that was
   that  stop the service or face disconnection
  
   I consider the demise of my service to have been rather
   unfortunate and I wish the Finnish remailer luck  It is a pity
   that there are very few if any similar services provided with in
   the US I guess thats the benefit of having a constitution that
   guarantees one freedom of speech and a legal and political system
   that conspires to subvert it in the name of the public good



88 What is going on with anonpenetfi run by J Helsingius


  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   Funny how beating the rest of the Usenet over the head with a
   stick is OK if its anonpenetfi and universal anon access  But
   somehow people on the other side of the same equation not even
   arguing to shut it off entirely but rather just to have some
   control applied to the abuses that manifest themselves arent
   allowed to do that
   
   I have written to Johan several times in the last couple of
   weeks  He used to reply to me quite readily After all I was
   the source of the software as originally delivered to him  he
   used to be downright prompt about replying to me Funny now
   hes being an impolite bastard who doesnt answer mail atall
   even when it consists of really very civil queries
  
  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius
  
   In your mail you told me you sent me one or more messages on Feb
   8th Feb 7th and 8th the server was down and the flood of mail
   that resulted from the server coming up again crashed my own mail
   host The problem was aggregated by an abusive user sending
   thousands of messages to another user filling up that users
   mailbox The bounce messages ended up in my mailbox overflowing
   my local disk as well
   
   I can only suppose that your message got lost in that hassle as
   I have tried to answer as much as possible of the anonrelated
   messages I get from routine misaddessed messages to complaints
   about the service On the average I spend 45 hours per day
   answering anonrelated messages
  
  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   Why is it that everybody else has to put up with the impoliteness
   and insensitivity of the misuse of anonpenetfi  Whose
   definitions of polite and sense apply and why Why is
   universal anon access considered to be within the realm of this
   fuzzy concept of politeness in the first place
   
   I think Johan has long since crossed the line into being a rude
   bastard and I told him so in private mail a little while ago
   
   At this point I deeply regret a having created an anonymous
   system supporting 1 newsgroup and b having given the code to
   Johan  I didnt copyright it but I thought that some concept of
   politeness and good sense might follow it to new
   homes  Interesting that Johans ideas of politeness and good
   sense seem to have nearly no interesection with mine I could
   even cope with universal anon access if Johan would be willing
   to engage in abuse control but somehow that seems to be outside
   the range of reality

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius
  
   There is no way for me to convey how sad and upset your message
   made me I do to some extent understand your feelings but it
   still feels really bad Running the server requires getting used
   to a lot of flames but mindlessly abusive hate mail is so much
   easier to deal with than something like this as I do respect and
   value your views and opinions to a high degree No Im not
   asking for sympathy I just wanted you to know that I am really
   giving your views quite a lot of weight
   
   When I asked for the software I was actually only going to
   provide the service to scandinavian users But a lot of people
   requested that I keep the service open to the international
   community I now realize that I ought to have contacted you at
   that point to ask how you feel about me using your stuff in such
   a context Again I really want to apologise And I will replace
   the remaining few pieces of code thet still stem from your
   system Unfortunately there is no way to remove the ideas and
   structure I got from you
   
   Again I am really sorry that the results of your work ended up
   being used in a way that you dont approve of And I will be
   giving a lot of hard thought to the possibility of shutting down
   the server alltogether
  
  From KarlKleinpastecscmuedu
  
   I think Im feeling especially rude and impolite  If its good
   for Johan its good for me  After all he didnt ask the
   greater Usenet whether universal anon access was a good idea he
   just did it  Yes Im a seriously rude pain in the ass now
   and I think Ill arm the Usenet Death Penalty slightly modified
   not for strategic wholesite attack but tactical assault just
   an09anonpenetfi destruction Only outside alt too
   lets say
   
   To parrot this linepeople have been doing things like the UDP
   that is cancelling others postings for years no one could
   ever stop them and its only politeness and good sense that has
   prevented them up to now
   
   In fact I have 8 people who have expressed privately the desire
   and ability to arm the UDP
   
   
   
   PS No in fact there are not 8 newsadmins ready to arm the
   UDP  It would be amusing to know how many people gulped hard
   when they read that though  I dont see it as any different
   from Johans configuration
   
   PPS Now that Ive calmed some fears by the above PS  There
   are 2 newsadmins ready to arm the UDP  Theyve asked for my
   code  I havent sent it yet Only one site would be necessary
   to bring anonpenetfi to a screeching halt  Anyone can
   implement the UDP on their own if they care to  Politeness and
   good sense prevents them from doing so I wonder how long before
   one form of impoliteness brings on another form

  From julfpenetfi Johan Helsingius
  
   It would be trivially easy to bring anonpenetfi to a screeching
   halt In fact it has happened a couple of times already But as
   we are talking threats here let me make one as well A very
   simple one If somebody uses something like the UDP or
   maliciously brings down anonpenetfi by some other means it
   will stay down But I will let the users know why And name the
   person who did it OK As somebody said on this thread You have
   to take personal responsibility for your actions right
  
  From avs20cccamdahlcom   134 Atul V Salgaonkar
  
   I am very grateful and appreciative of this service  courtesey of
   penetfi  Some important questions about my personal
   lifecareerjob were resolved due to kind help of other people
   who had been thru similar situations In return I have also
   replied to anon postings where I thought I could make a positive
   contribution
   
   In general anon service is a great in my opinion although like
   any tool some people will not use it responsibly I suggest that
   it should be kept alive Wasting bandwidth is less important than
   saving lives I think
  
  From us273532mmmserc3mcom Elisa J Collins
  
   I have been informed that the anonymous posting service to many
   newsgroups has been turned off as a result of discussions in this
   newsgroup over people abusing it
   
   I had been posting to a nontechnical misc newsgroup about an
   intimate topic for which I felt I required privacy I have
   received immeasurable help from the people in that newsgroup and
   I have never used anonymity to behave in an abusive immature or
   unethical fashion toward anyone
   
   Please folks believe me I need this service  Please
   consider my point of view and permit adminanonpenetfi to turn
   the service back on
   
   Thank you
