The cryptokey disclosure issue hasnt come up yet but current law
suggests that its a loser for the defendanthell be compelled to turn
over the key

It has actually come up or it will in a week or two in NZ  Ill post the
outcome when the trial finishes which could take months BTW  Overall it
looks like you cant be forced to reveal a password if anyone can provide
a convincing legal argument to the contrary ie an actual court case Id
be most interested
