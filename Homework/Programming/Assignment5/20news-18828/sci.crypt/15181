                 Network and Distributed System Security

        34 February 1994 Catamaran Hotel San Diego California

The symposium will bring together people who are building software and
hardware to provide network or distributed system security services
The symposium is intended for those interested in practical aspects of
network and distributed system security rather than in theory  Symposium
proceedings will be published by the Internet Society  Topics for the
symposium include but are not limited to the following

   video multicast and conferencing news groups network management
   boot services mobile computing and remote IO

  Special issues and problems in security architecture such as
