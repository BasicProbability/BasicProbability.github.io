Subject Re PEM and MIME

 I would suggest that 50 attractive MIME formatted news messages a day would be
 sufficient to get a few people thinking about adding MIME support to news
 readers esp if the content is really worth it

        But thats just the problem There is no such thing as
        MIMEFormatted By analogy MIME is a contentlabelling
        standard for the box not a specification for the contents
        themselves It provides a standard for likeminded
        individuals to exchange mail containing an agreedupon data
        format

        You say tomahto I say tomaeto you say postscript I say
        SGML
        
        Cheers
                Marc
