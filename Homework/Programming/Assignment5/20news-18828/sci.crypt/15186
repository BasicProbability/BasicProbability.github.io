From tcmaynetcomcom Timothy C May
Subject Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption


Well it now seems obvious what Professor Denning was doing last fall
when this key escrow trial balloon was raised

All the more need for endtoend encryption schemes that bypass the
governmentapproved system

By the way the Clipper nameisnt this already used for the
Clipper processor from Intergraph I doubt theyre the ones making the
chip so a name conflict may be present
