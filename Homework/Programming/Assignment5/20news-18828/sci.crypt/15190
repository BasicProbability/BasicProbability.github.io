No but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where as it
happens evidence that will convict you is stored 

The cryptokey disclosure issue hasnt come up yet but current law
suggests that its a loser for the defendanthell be compelled to turn
over the key

The test for compelled selfincrimination is whether the material to 
be disclosed in itself tends to inculpate the discloser In the example
I gave above the safe key itself has no testimonial valueergo it can
be disclosed under compulsion eg subpoena duces tecum

Moreover the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
keycompelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you Of course they
can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
you
Mike

    Lets carry this one step further Suppose the text of the key is
in itself conclusive evidence of the SAME CRIME for which the
encrypted material is further evidence I find myself envisaging a
scenario like this

You have made some scans of Peanuts strips You encrypt them The key
is a phrase

The Comic Police haul you in They seize your system They find the
encrypted file

CP    Whats that file

You   I take the fifth

CP    Whats the keyphrase to that file 

You   I take the fifth

Judge You have to reveal the keyphrase I disagree but Im not a judge

You   Your Honor revealing the keyphrase in its own right would 
	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws independent of what 
	may or may not be in the encrypted file  

Judge I grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key
	itself

You    The keyphrase is I confess to deliberately evading copyright 
	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of 
        copyrighted Peanuts strips

Judge and CP Oh

     How will they get you now Im not saying that they wont or
cant or even that they shouldnt  but what legal mechanism will
they use Should we be crossposting this to misclegal
