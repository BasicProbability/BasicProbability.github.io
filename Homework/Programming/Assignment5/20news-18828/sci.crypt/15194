Subject Re MacPGP 22 Source Problems

Yes  my error  you will need the DIFF between the
standard consoleh and consolec supplied with
Symantecs THINK C 504 and the specially modified
one that works with MacPGP 22

I added the two DIFFs to the end of the signature
file MacPGP22srcSIGNATURE in pubgrady of netcomcom

Please download via anonymous FTP and using SED oops
cutting and pasting fixemup        

Will one of you Macgeniuses PLEASE port this to MacApp
or AppMaker or

Grady
