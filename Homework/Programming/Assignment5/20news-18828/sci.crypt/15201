Subject Re Clipper Crypto

I sent a response to the White House at

	0005895485MCIMAILCOM White House

and received a nice automatic reply from MICMAIL noting in passing that
if I had included a SNail address I would get a reply in due course

For those who care my reply was

	1	yes lets protect the voice network

	2	privatelydeveloped crypto has always been available and
		always will be  so lets think about how to do law
		enforcement given that fact not about how to hope to
		legislate against it

	3	my needs for crypto as a system designer are not met by the
		Clipper Chip  I want freely to export uses of algorithms
		like DES  RSA which are already freely available in the
		destination country
