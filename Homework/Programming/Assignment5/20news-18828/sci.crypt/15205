since the price of 144 M 35 floppies were still high until the last

It has been done already

In the UK the Atari ST box was shipped with 360K disks in the first few
years and then later 720K disks In order to make life less complicated
many freebie disks on mags were double formatted like this Side 0 of the
disk had 360K on it and could be read  by any ST It also had a flipside
program This would swap the sides around so that side 1 became side 0
