The 80bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom

I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
people who designed the system  Why on the Earth split the
80bit key in 40bit parts to keep them in escrow separately
having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply
could keep 80bit sequences in N N2 independent places
and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key N1
sequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the
actual key XORed with the random sequences

Or is it a conspiracy 12
