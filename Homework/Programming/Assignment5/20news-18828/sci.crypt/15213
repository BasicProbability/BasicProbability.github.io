Subject Re White House Public Encryption Management Fact Sheet

clippercsrcncslnistgov Clipper Chip Announcement writes

The President has approved a directive on Public Encryption
Management  The directive provides for the following



When
exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests



The Attorney General of the United States or her representative
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the US governmentdeveloped
keyescrow microcircuits in their products

Quite interesting  How does the US administration intend to persuade
non  US governments to let the NSA eavesdrop on them  Or should US
companies install these chips in communication systems sold abroad
without the customers knowedge or consent or not at all
