Subject Re How to detect use of an illegal cipher

Jay Fenton FentonKaleidaCom writes

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic ie In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank

	I was thinking about this also Its quite possible the
system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being
used That way they can start a tap get the serial number and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key

	If they tap someone whos apparently using encryption but
dont find that prefix then theyll assume its an unauthorized
encryption scheme


	May the Kloo Gnomes be generous to you
