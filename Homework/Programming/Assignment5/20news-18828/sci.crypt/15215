Subject More Clipper Stuff

As of yet there has been no description of the general principles
behind the Clipper proposal For example is this a public key system
or a private key system If the latter then I dont see how the
system could work given that the keys are tied to the device and
not the person

Further the escrowed 80bit keys are split into two 40bit chunks
I would guess that the availability of one of these 40bit chunks
and a reasonable keysearch machine would allow you to read the traffic
Im not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system
but it does make you think Of course this is easily fixable by 
giving out two 80bit chunks which could be xored to generate the 
real 80bit key
