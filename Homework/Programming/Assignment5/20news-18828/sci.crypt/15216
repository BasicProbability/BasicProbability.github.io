PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

  

The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the governments ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase


Talk about adding insult to injury  

I for one believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration not continued  Instead it looks like that
illgotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment
