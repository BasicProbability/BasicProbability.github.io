Subject Re Reinventing Crypto Policy  An EFF Statement

In article 1qna0tINNf5prodanUUNET avgrodanUUNET Vadim Antonov writes
 I somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
 people who designed the system  Why on the Earth split the
 80bit key in 40bit parts to keep them in escrow separately
 having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
 it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply
 could keep 80bit sequences in N N2 independent places
 and then XOR all the partial keys to get the actual key N1
 sequences should obviously be selected randomly and Nth is the
 actual key XORed with the random sequences

Without real technical details its hard to answer this question But
suppose they already are XORing the two 40bit parts to produce only
40 bits of real key material Maybe theyre using the exportable version
of RC2
