 PK Perhaps we need the telephony equivalent of an anonymous remailer for
    the telephone network Back in Prohibition days alcohol that is I
    understand a device called the cheesebox was a popular means to thwart
    the tracing of telephone calls It connected two phone lines in the back
    room of an otherwise uninvolved business It was the conceptual predecesso
    of todays anonymous email remailer
 
 The old cheesebox was the preCarterphone version of the call
 diverter  After the Carterphone decision there were several vendors
 that sold call diverters  Ive got a couple in my basement that
 were used to redirect my office phone to my home number when I
 didnt feel like going into the office
 
 Itd be quite easy to generate an anonymous redialer version of the
 call diverter
 

About 18 months ago I heard a report on NPR about a 900number
1900STOPPER or some such for placing untraceable calls
You call them and on bong tone dial the number you want to
call they told the NPR interviewer that nothing short of a
court order which theyd fight would make them release their
records
