From tcmaynetcomcom Timothy C May
Subject Clipper an Infringement on Intergraphs Name

Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties not the subject
in this post the name Clipper Chip seems very confusable with the
Clipper chip of Intergraph

Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor Clipper was
a 32bit RISC microprocessor It is still used in some workstations
notably those from Intergraph the supplier of CAD tools Intergraph
acquired the Clipper product line when Fairchild was sold to National
Semiconductor several years back

When I first saw Clipper Chip in the announcement I immediately
thought the article was referring to the Clipper chip I know

This seems to be grounds for Intergraph to sue but then Im not a
lawyer Id say Im a cryptologist but I dont want to incriminate
myself under the laws of the new regime
