   CocaCola has always understood it
 
  Cocacola is made under licence in dozens of countries around the
  world  Youre crazy if you think PepsiCo doesnt know the recipe
 
 In all those countries Cocacola is distributed in a form of
 concentrate what the local producers simply mix with water and other
 simple ingredients The trick is to know what is in the concentrate
 

I dont know if this is still true but at one time CocaCola
took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret  For instance
several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
concentrates which were then shipped backand forth and remixed
in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
formula  By now I would guess that PepsiCos chemists would have
reverseengineered it cant be all that exotic  Actually I
prefer Pepsi anyhow in about 3 minutes Im gonna put money
into a Pepsi vending machine
