Subject Re How to detect use of an illegal cipher

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic ie In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow run them against my ciphertext and draw a blank

	I was thinking about this also Its quite possible the
system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being
used That way they can start a tap get the serial number and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key

	If they tap someone whos apparently using encryption but
dont find that prefix then theyll assume its an unauthorized
encryption scheme

	This doesnt handle superencrypted traffic If the clipper
doesnt impose any unfortunate performance sideeffects theres no
reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of tripleDES encrypted
traffic That way your traffic looks normal and perhaps anyone
desiring to listen in wont even bother since they know nobodys
going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for
important stuff
