FACT  It is unlawful to distribute code implementing RSA without a license
to do so from PKP whether or not one is charging for it  Furthermore
any use of RSA other than for research purposes allowed under US patent
law is similarly unlawful  Therefore the average citizen cannot use
RSA to encrypt message traffic in the US without a license from PKP

WRONG  I dont think even PKP claims this one  It is not unlawful to
distribute code implementing RSA  It appears to be unlawful to use it so
I agree with your last sentence

FACT  There are no restrictions yet on the use of cryptography under
US law although this is beginning to look like it will change  The only
impediments to widespread use of RSA cryptography in the US are PKPs
patents

Yes thats correct
