Subject Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption

And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones because the only reason a person would want
one is to evade the police

	Then theyll probably also want to start tracking the customer
lists of people purchasing SoundBlaster and similar boards which can
be configured with the use of some code and a modem to act as a pretty
decent digitalencrypting telephone Its expensive though and kind
of awkward I dont know any drug lords but Im sure theyd favor
something tappable over something secure as long as the user interface
is nice

	When youve got HRH Prince of Wales saying stupid things over
cordless phones its not hard to imagine that drug dealers child
pornographers commies LISP programmers and other threats to the
civilized world might transact incriminating business over encrypting
cellular phones
