Subject Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption
From uniacsbuedu Shaen Bernhardt

In article 1qmugcINNpu9gapcaltechedu halccocaltechedu Hal Finney writes
The key question is whether nonClipper encryption will be made illegal

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans
have the right to Clipper encryption but not to unbreakable encryption
This implies that ultimately nonClipper strong encryption must become
illegal

Text deleted no value judgement implied

Its shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

More than shocking  What this says to me is no less than that government
is very interested in monitoring the public  This does more than scare me
it mortifies me

PGP and RIPEM must become widespread enough to resist what Mr Finney has
IMHO correctly identified as the next logical step  What was once an
academic discussion with regard to concealing cyphertext has now become
a real consideration

The rhetoric that the clinton administration seems obsessed with harmony
either or propositions tension tells me that they know how difficult
it will be to sell this proposition

The phrase I hear more and more is I cant believe this is actually happening
here  Call me conserative Clinton was a huge mistake that well all be
paying for tommorow and many years from now

Have we approached the age of speakeasy public key depositiories
