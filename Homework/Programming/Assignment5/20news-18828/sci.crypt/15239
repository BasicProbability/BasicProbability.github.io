	When youve got HRH Prince of Wales saying stupid things over
cordless phones its not hard to imagine that drug dealers child
pornographers commies LISP programmers and other threats to the
civilized world might transact incriminating business over encrypting
cellular phones


Lets assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
escrow houses  Lets say you even trust the escrow houses  one is
the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And Im not entirely joking about
those two names

In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
system  Indeed as pointed out since the current systems even the
current digital systems are very easy to decode  right now anybody
with an old TV can hear them  for most people this will be viewed
as an oh goody step upwards

And look at how tolerant the public is  Theyre willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now

It was suggested by one person that a lot of nonevidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants because anybody can do it and its
just an ECPA violation  This would stop that  All tapping would need
a warrant or a breach of security at the escrow houses
