 Oh great Wonderful news Nobody can listen inexcept the feds 

Hey its better than the status quo

I am far less worried about the feds tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls

It would be stupid to rely on even a Clipperized channel for truly 
sensitive material but it does seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
guard against casual eavesdropping  For example even with my strong right 
to bear arms view of the private right to possess and use strong 
cryptosystems the system as described provides enough security that I would 
actually buy a cordless phone and would be much less wary of using cellular 
phones walkietalkies and so on  As long as its only used for massmarket 
voice scrambling I actually dont see a problem with it

If you want more security than it offers use something different  Use PKCS 
for electronic mail CELP over DES or triple DES with DiffieHellman key 
exchange for your voice traffic or whatever

And yes Id rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted but this is at 
least an incrememental improvement for certain applications
