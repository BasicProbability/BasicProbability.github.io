FAQ for scicrypt part 1 Overview

This is the first of ten parts of the scicrypt FAQ The parts are
mostly independent but you should read this part before the rest We
dont have the time to send out missing parts by mail so dont ask
Notes such as KAH67 refer to the reference list in the last part

Disclaimer This document is the product of the Crypt Cabal a secret
society which serves the National Secuuh no Seriously were the
good guys and weve done what we can to ensure the completeness and
accuracy of this document but in a field of military and commercial
importance like cryptography you have to expect that some people and
organizations consider their interests more important than open
scientific discussion Trust only what you can verify firsthand
And dont sue us
