 In mathematical terms what is a privatekey cryptosystem

  A privatekey cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a
  decryption system D The encryption system E is a collection of
  functions EK indexed by keys K mapping some set of
  plaintexts P to some set of ciphertexts C Similarly the
  decryption system D is a collection of functions DK such that
  DKEKP  P for every plaintext P  That is succesful decryption
  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key
  index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext
  into ciphertext  Such systems wherein the same key value is used to
  encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric cryptoystems

 What is an attack

  In intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method
  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their
  corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out
  more information about the plaintexts Its possible to state
  mathematically what this means Here we go

  Fix functions F G and H of n variables Fix an encryption system E
  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys

  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an
  algorithm A with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that
  there is probability p of computing h  HP1Pn if we have
  f  FP1Pn and g  GEKP1EKPn Note that this
  probability depends on the distribution of the vector KP1Pn

  The attack is trivial or pointless if there is probability at
  least p of computing h  HP1Pn if f  FP1Pn and
  g  GC1Cn Here C1Cn range uniformly over the possible
  ciphertexts and have no particular relation to P1Pn In other
  words an attack is trivial if it doesnt actually use the encryptions
  EKP1EKPn

  An attack is called oneciphertext if n  1 twociphertext if
  n  2 and so on

 Whats the advantage of formulating all this mathematically

  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure
  Read part 3 we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this
  property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem
  is strong

  In contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely
  formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is
  strong We say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against
  all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as
  defined above is too slow to be practical If we can prove this
  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist
  any passive cryptanalytic technique If we can reduce this statement
  to some wellknown unsolved problem then we still have confidence that
  the cryptosystem isnt easy to break

  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical
  definition Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions
  were making and prove that they produce the desired results We can
  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used
  properly it just means that the assumptions are valid

  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too The cryptanalyst
  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions Often he can try to
  construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails
  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis
  
 Why is the onetime pad secure

  By definition the onetime pad is a cryptosystem where the
  plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings
  of some length m and EKP is just the sum lets say the exclusive
  or of K and P

  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial
  singleciphertext attacks on the onetime pad assuming a uniform
  distribution of keys Note that we dont have to assume a uniform
  distribution of plaintexts Heres the proof Let A be an attack
  ie an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h
  with some probability p that h  HP whenever f  FP and
  g  GEKP ie g  GK  P Then because the distribution of
  K is uniform and independent of P the distribution of K  P must also
  be uniform and independent of P But also the distribution of C is
  uniform and independent of P Hence there is probability exactly p
  that h  HP whenever f  FP and g  GC over all P and C Thus
  a fortiori A is trivial

  On the other hand the onetime pad is not secure if a key K is used
  for more than one plaintext ie there are nontrivial
  multipleciphertext attacks So to be properly used a key K must be
  thrown away after one encryption The key is also called a pad
  this explains the name onetime pad

 Whats a ciphertextonly attack

  In the notation above a ciphertextonly attack is one where F is
  constant Given only some information GEKP1EKPn about
  n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some
  information HP1Pn about the plaintexts The attack is trivial
  if it has just as good a chance of producing HP1Pn when given
  GC1Cn for random C1Cn

  For example say GC  C and say HP is the first bit of P We can
  easily write down an attackthe guessing attack which simply
  guesses that HP is 1 This attack is trivial because it doesnt use
  the ciphertext it has a fiftyfifty chance of guessing correctly no
  matter what On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which
  produces one bit of information about P with 100 success using C
  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50 So this is
  a nontrivial attack

 Whats a knownplaintext attack

  The classic knownplaintext attack has FP1P2  P1
  GC1C2  C1C2 and HP1P2 depending only on P2
  In other words given two ciphertexts C1 and C2 and one decryption
  P1 the knownplaintext attack should produce information about the
  other decryption P2

  Note that knownplaintext attacks are often defined in the literature
  as producing information about the key but this is pointless the
  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him
  decrypt further messages

 Whats a chosenplaintext attack

  A chosenplaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical
  series of active attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the
  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor These attacks dont fit into
  our model of passive attacks explained above Anyway a
  chosenplaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and
  look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured
  out how to decrypt any message More absurd examples of this sort of
  attack are the chosenkey attack and chosensystem attack

  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption
  attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a
  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext

  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks
  for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext P as
  TEKhTRPRP where T is a timekey sequence number chosen anew
  for each message R is a random number and h is a oneway hash
  function Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusiveor

 In mathematical terms what can you say about bruteforce attacks

  Consider the following knownplaintext attack We are given some
  plaintexts P1Pn1 and ciphertexts C1Cn1 Were
  also given a ciphertext Cn We run through every key K When we find
  K such that EKPi  Ci for every i  n we print DKCn

  If n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed
  on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results
  only once in a blue moon for random inputs Thus this is a nontrivial
  attack Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many
  possible keys

 Whats a keyguessing attack Whats entropy

  Say somebody is using the onetime padbut isnt choosing keys
  randomly and uniformly from all mbit messages as he was supposed to
  for our security proof In fact say hes known to prefer keys which
  are English words Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English
  words as possible keys This attack will often succeed and its much
  faster than a bruteforce search of the entire keyspace

  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its
  entropy This number E is the number of real bits of information
  of the key a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within
  2E guesses E is defined as the sum of pK log2 pK where pK is
  the probability of key K
