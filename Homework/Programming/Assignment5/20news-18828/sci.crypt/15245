 How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect

  WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break
  The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams a typed password
  and a bytewide counter initialized to 1the password length Full
  descriptions are given in Bennett BEN87 and Bergen and Caelli
  BER91

  Chris Galas writes Someone awhile back was looking for a way to
  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution 
  There is a software company named Accessdata 87 East 600 South
  Orem UT 84058 18006585199 that has a software package that will
  decrypt any WordPerfect Lotus 123 QuatroPro MS Excel and Paradox
  files The cost of the package is 185 Steep prices but if you
  think your pw key is less than 10 characters or 10 char give them a
  call and ask for the free demo disk The demo disk will decrypt files
  that have a 10 char or less pw key

 How do I break a Vigenere repeatedkey cipher

  A repeatedkey cipher where the ciphertext is something like the
  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY and so on is called a Vigenere cipher
  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English do the
  following 

  1 Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences
  See Gaines GAI44 Sinkov SIN66 Trying each displacement of
  the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal 
  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something
  over 6 of the bytes will be equal If they have used different
  key then less than 04 will be equal assuming random 8bit bytes
  of key covering normal ASCII text The smallest displacement which
  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key

  2 Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself This
  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself Since
  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte 2 streams of
  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8bit byte providing
  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption And in fact
  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte

  If the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a
  standard polyalphabetic substitution All the old cryptanalysis
  texts show how to break those Its possible with those methods in
  the hands of an expert if theres only ten times as much text as key
  See for example Gaines GAI44 Sinkov SIN66

 How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX PGP RIPEM PEM 

  Heres one popular method using the des command

    cat file  compress  des privatekey  uuencode  mail

  Meanwhile there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called
  PEM Privacy Enhanced Mail It is described in RFCs 1421 through
  1424 To join the PEM mailing list contact pemdevrequesttiscom
  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this
  writing

  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting
  mail PGP and RIPEM  Both are available by FTP  Each has its own
  newsgroup altsecuritypgp and altsecurityripem  Each has its own FAQ
  as well

  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm
  without a license and RSAs patent is valid only or at least primarily
  in the USA

  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which
  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside
  the USA

  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of
  the message PGP used IDEA RIPEM uses DES and RSA for encrypting the
  message key they should be able to interoperate freely  Although there
  have been repeated calls for each to understand the others formats and
  algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as
  we know

 Is the UNIX crypt command secure

  No See REE84 There is a program available called cbw crypt
  breakers workbench which can be used to do ciphertextonly attacks
  on files encrypted with crypt One source for CBW is FTPCB

 How do I use compression with encryption

  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by
  some simple encryption method eg XOR with a repeated key

  Unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact
  distribution of possible inputs For all practical purposes its
  impossible to describe the typical English text beyond coarse
  characteristics such as singleletter frequencies You can build up
  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy
  has a slightly more accurate model hell be able to find some
  redundancy in your compressed output

  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they
  have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that
  actually starts off with high redundancy For example the output of
  UNIX compress begins with a wellknown threebyte magic number
  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis
  
  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a
  bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means
  removes the need for strong encryption

  Compression after encryption is silly

 Is there an unbreakable cipher

  Yes The onetime pad is unbreakable see part 4 Unfortunately the
  onetime pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as
  plaintext

  Of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be
  useful Rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by
  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is
  expected to remain valid

 What does random mean in cryptography

  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom
  number generator than most applications For a source of bits to be
  cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to
  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of
  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of
  0th through N1st bits for all N up to the lifetime of the source

  A software generator also known as pseudorandom has the function
  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently
  random bits  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by
  the opponent  Ideally it should also be truly random perhaps
  generated by a hardware random number source

  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could for example
  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of
  entropy by not connecting anything to it  For example

	cat devaudio  compress  foo

  gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in
  it  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key
  for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudorandom
  string

  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is
  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that
  because it looks complicated to a human it must be random  For
  example disk operation completion times sound like they might be
  unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a
  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy

 What is the unicity point aka unicity distance

  See SHA49 The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount
  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in
  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number
  of ciphertext bits used Ciphertexts significantly longer than this
  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment This is used to
  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertextonly cryptanalysis 
  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have
  multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security
  from the opponents difficulty choosing the correct one

  Unicity distance like all statistical or informationtheoretic
  measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives
  probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext
  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible
  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys
  are tried for the decryption Working cryptologists dont normally
  deal with unicity distance as such Instead they directly determine
  the likelihood of events of interest

  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters If fewer than
  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not
  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of
  possible keys DES has a unicity distance of 175 characters
  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to
  8 ASCII characters This may seem alarmingly low at first but
  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work
  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been
  intercepted

  In fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used
  in discussing unicity distance Like other measures such as key
  size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if
  its too small but doesnt guarantee security if its high Few
  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all
  manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges to crack
  some cipher messages However similar informationtheoretic
  considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a
  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem
  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and
  informationtheoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most
  promising directions

  Unfortunately most literature on the application of information
  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal
  1940 work of Alan Turing see KOZ84 For some insight into the
  possibilities see KUL68 and GOO83

 What is key management and why is it important

  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in
  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system
  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption Of
  course one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling
  Mossad about its cryptosystems but Mossad probably finds out anyway
  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can
  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress Thus especially in
  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are
  transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but
  also enough key material to cover the traffic

  Key management refers to the distribution authentication and
  handling of keys

  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology
  is the STU III secure telephone unit which for classified use
  employs individual coded Crypto Ignition Keys and a central Key
  Management Center operated by NSA There is a hierarchy in that
  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control
  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and
  to perform installationmaintenance functions such as the
  reporting of lost CIKs

  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management
  problem For publickey systems there are several related issues
  many having to do with whom do you trust

 Can I use pseudorandom or chaotic numbers as a key stream

  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from
  relatively compact generators Perhaps the simplest example is a
  linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random
  number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds
  and outputs Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a
  high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice Mathematically
  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for
  cryptanalysts to exploit More complicated generators have more
  complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures
  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable
  structure at all

  See KNU81 exercise 357 REE77 and BOY89

 What is the correct frequency list for English letters

  There are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than
  the one before You can find the first answer in various books
  namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of
  English text Of course any such list will be correctly computed
  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken

  The second answer is that the question doesnt make sense What do
  you mean by English letters The English language is not a
  fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized It
  has changed over time it is different between different authors
  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of
  the language as a whole

  The third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have
  exactly the same characteristics as English in general but for all
  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies wont matter
  In fact theres an entire field called Bayesian statistics other
  buzzwords are maximum entropy methods and maximum likelihood
  estimation which studies questions like Whats the chance that a
  text with these letter frequencies is in English and comes up with
  reasonably robust answers

  So make your own list from your own samples of English text It will
  be good enough for practical work if you use it properly

 What is the Enigma

  For a project in data security we are looking for sources of
  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by
  the British during WWII

  See WEL82 DEA85 KOZ84 HOD83 KAH91

 How do I shuffle cards

  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of
  values using a random or pseudorandom function  All possible output
  permutations of this process should be equally likely  To do this you
  need a random function modranx which will produce a uniformly
  distributed random integer in the interval 0x1  Given that
  function you can shuffle with the following C code assuming ARRLTH
  is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two
  addresses given

  for  n  ARRLTH1 n  0  n  swap arrmodran n1  arrn  

  modranx can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno  x since
  rannos interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the
  error will be very small  To cover this case one can take rannos
  modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less
  than y go back and get another ranno value


 Can I foil SW pirates by encrypting my CDROM

  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CDROM with
  possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted
  separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps
  even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy

  As far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard
  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the
  keyboard  If there were such an identification then the CDROM could be
  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in
  part on the unique identifier  However in this case the CDROM is one
  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose

  If the CDROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must
  be a key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in
  the process  That key is useable with any copy of the CDROMs data
  The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the
  illegal copy
