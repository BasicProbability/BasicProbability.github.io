 How may one obtain copies of FIPS and ANSI standards cited herein

  Many textbooks on cryptography contain complete reprints of the FIPS
  standards which are not copyrighted

  The following standards may be ordered from the
      US Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service
      Springfield VA 22161

      FIPS PUB 461 Data Encryption Standard  this is DES
      FIPS PUB 74   Guidelines for Implementing as Using the NBS DES
      FIPS PUB 81   DES Modes of Operation
      FIPS PUB 113  Computer Data Authentication using DES

  The following standards may be ordered from the

      ANSI X3921981  Data Encryption Algorithm identical to FIPS 461
      ANSI X31061983 DEA Modes of Operation    identical to FIPS 113

  Notes  Figure 3 in FIPS PUB 461 is in error but figure 3 in X3921981
      is correct  The text is correct in both publications
