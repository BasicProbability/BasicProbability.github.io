FAQ for scicrypt part 2 Net Etiquette

This is the second of ten parts of the scicrypt FAQ The parts are
mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest
We dont have the time to send out missing parts by mail so dont ask
Notes such as KAH67 refer to the reference list in the last part

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfmmitedu

 What groups are around Whats a FAQ Who am I Why am I here

  Read newsannouncenewusers and newsanswers for a few weeks Always
  make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it
  Youll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same
  newsgroup After a month youll have a much better sense of what the
  readers want to see

 Do political discussions belong in scicrypt

  No In fact some newsgroups notably misclegalcomputing were
  created exactly so that political questions like Should RSA be
  patented dont get in the way of technical discussions Many
  scicrypt readers also read misclegalcomputing comporgefftalk
  comppatents scimath compcompression et al for the benefit of
  people who dont care about those other topics try to put your
  postings in the right group

  Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other noncryptographic
  spy stuff dont belong in scicrypt either

 How do I present a new encryption scheme in scicrypt

  I just came up with this neat method of encryption Heres some
  ciphertext FHDSIJOYWOGBUJHKFSYUIRE Is it strong Without a
  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on scicrypt

  If you have come up with an encryption scheme providing some
  ciphertext from it is not adequate Nobody has ever been impressed by
  random gibberish Any new algorithm should be secure even if the
  opponent knows the full algorithm including how any message key is
  distributed and only the private key is kept secret There are some
  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts
  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm but
  this is a timeconsuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most
  scicrypt readers wont bother with

  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme First of all
  find out if its really new Look through this FAQ for references and
  related methods Familiarize yourself with the literature and the
  introductory textbooks

  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at
  large try to break it yourself You shouldnt waste the time of tens
  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily
  answered on your own

  If you really think your system is secure and you want to get some
  reassurance from experts you might try posting full details of your
  system including working code and a solid theoretical explanation to
  scicrypt Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated
  in some areas

  If youre lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted
  You can encourage this by offering cash rewardsfor instance noted
  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering 1000 to anyone who can break
  Snefru4but there are no guarantees If you dont have enough
  experience then most likely any experts who look at your system will
  be able to find a flaw If this happens its your responsibility to
  consider the flaw and learn from it rather than just add one more
  layer of complication and come back for another round

  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA
  look at it A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope
  of this FAQ

  Among professionals a common rule of thumb is that if you want to
  design a cryptosystem you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst
