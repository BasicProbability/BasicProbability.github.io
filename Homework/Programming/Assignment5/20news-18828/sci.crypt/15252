 What is a product cipher

  A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak
  operations such as substitution transposition modular
  additionmultiplication and linear transformation A block
  cipher just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data8 bytes
  sayall at once then goes on to the next block The notion of
  product ciphers is due to Shannon SHA49 Examples of modern
  product ciphers include LUCIFER SOR84 DES NBS77 SPnetworks
  KAM78 LOKI BRO90 FEAL SHI84 PES LAI90 Khufu and Khafre
  ME91a The socalled Feistel ciphers are a class of product
  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round
  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round LUCIFER
  DES LOKI and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers

  The following table compares the main parameters of several product 
  ciphers

 What makes a product cipher secure

  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is
  completely secure So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the
  cipher looks highly random For example the cipher must be
  nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends
  on every bit of the plaintext and the key Meyer MEY78 has shown
  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a
  dependence In this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing
  function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a
  complex nonlinear fashion

  The fixed perround substitutions of the product cipher are
  referred to as Sboxes For example LUCIFER has 2 Sboxes and DES
  has 8 Sboxes The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a
  careful design of these Sboxes A list of partial design criteria
  for the Sboxes of DES which apply to Sboxes in general may be
  found in Brown BRO89 and Brickell et al BRI86

 What are some grouptheoretic properties of product ciphers

  Let E be a product cipher that maps Nbit blocks to Nbit blocks
  Let EKX be the encryption of X under key K Then for any fixed K
  the map sending X to EKX is a permutation of the set of Nbit
  blocks Denote this permutation by PK The set of all Nbit
  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S2N
  The collection of all these permutations PK where K ranges over all
  possible keys is denoted ES2N If E were a random mapping from
  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect ES2N to generate
  a large subset of S2N

  Coppersmith and Grossman COP74 have shown that a very simple
  product cipher can generate the alternating group A2N given a
  sufficient number of rounds The alternating group is half of the
  symmetric group it consists of all even permutations ie all
  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps
  Even and Goldreich EVE83 were able to extend these results to show
  that Feistel ciphers can generate A2N given a sufficient number
  of rounds

  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the
  grouptheoretic properties of a cipher Multiple encipherment is an
  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1 K2 there does
  not exist a third key K3 such that

  EK2EK1X  EK3X                

  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys
  K1 K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3  If
  for every K1 K2 there exists a K3 such that eq  is true then
  we say that E is a group

  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was
  extensively studied by Sherman Kaliski and Rivest SHE88 In their
  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a
  group In fact DES is not a group CAM93

 What can be proven about the security of a product cipher

  Recall from above that PK is a permutation produced by E under
  some key K The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that PK
  appears to be a random element of S2N the symmetric group
  Let R be an element of S2N selected randomly We will say that PK
  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given PK and R in some
  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial
  time That is with time bounded resources the observer cannot
  determine which of the permutations is produced by E the optimal
  decision is no better than simply guessing

  Luby and Rackoff LUB88 have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers
  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by
  random boolean functions

 How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size

  There are four standard modes of operation and numerous nonstandard
  ones as well  The standard modes of operation are defined in the US
  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 81
  published in 1980  See the question about ECB below for more details

  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher the modes of
  operation can be used with any block cipher

 Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication

  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself
  that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself 
  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation  But one
  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and 
  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages
  that were authenticated using that key
  
  See ANSI X31061983 and FIPS 113 1985 for a standard method of message
  authentication using DES

 What exactly is DES

  DES is the US Governments Data Encryption Standard  a product 
  cipher that operates on 64bit blocks of data using a 56bit key  

  It is defined in FIPS 461 1988 which supersedes FIPS 46 1977
  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS
  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm DEA
  defined in ANSI X3921981 

 What is triple DES

  Triple DES is a product cipher which like DES operates on 64bit 
  data blocks  There are several forms each of which uses the DES
  cipher 3 times  Some forms use two 56bit keys some use three
  The DES modes of operation may also be used with tripleDES

  Some people refer to EK1DK2EK1x as tripleDES

  This method is defined in chapter 72 of the ANSI standard X9171985
  Financial Institution Key Management and is intended for use in
  encrypting DES keys and IVs for Automated Key Distribution  Its
  formal name is Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key
  Pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE

  That standard says section 721 Key encrypting keys may be a single
  DEA key or a DEA key pair  Key pairs shoud be used where additional
  security is needed eg the data protected by the keys has a long
  security life  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a
  single key

  Others use the term tripleDES for EK1DK2EK3x or
  EK1EK2EK3x

  One of us Carl Ellison keeps advocating DES triple use in the form
  EK1 TRAN EK2 TRAN EK3 COMPRESS x  where each DES instance
  has its own key and IV for CBC mode and TRAN has been posted on
  scicrypt  It is a largeblock transposition program taking its key
  from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on
  its own part

 What is differential cryptanalysis

  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be
  applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on
  a repeated round function The method was recently popularized by
  Biham and Shamir BIH91 but Coppersmith has remarked that the
  Sboxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago
  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers
  notably FEAL BI91a

  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of
  ciphertexts Y Y whose corresponding plaintexts X X satisfy a
  known difference D  XX where  is componentwise XOR In the
  basic BihamShamir attack 247 such plaintext pairs are required
  to determine the key for DES Substantially fewer pairs are required
  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds In these cases the actual key
  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs
  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many
  known plaintexts

  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling
  observations on the algorithm Most importantly if the key
  schedule was removed from DES and a 1648  768bit key was used
  the key could be recovered in less than 264 steps Thus
  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES
  Further the Sboxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that
  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant
  improvement in the differential attack

  Adi Shamir is quoted to say NYTimes Oct 13 1991 I would say
  that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence
  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened

 How was NSA involved in the design of DES

  According to Kinnucan KIN78 Tuchman a member of the group that
  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying We developed the DES
  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers The NSA did not
  dictate a single wire Tuchman and Meyer another developer of
  DES spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in
  Lucifer They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer Their
  basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation
  and key scheduling functions  IBM has classified the notes
  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA
  The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep
  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains Tuchman
  
  On the other hand a document called Involvement of the NSA in
  the development of DES unclassified summary of the United States
  Select Committee on Intelligence printed in the IEEE
  Communications Magazine p5355 1978 states In the development
  of DES NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient
  indirectly assisted in the development of the Sbox structures and
  certified that the final DES algorithm was to the best of their
  knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness

  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA
  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the
  algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense
  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman
  presented above

 Is DES available in software

  Several people have made DES code available via ftp see part 10 for
  pathnames Stig Ostholm FTPSO BSD FTPBK Eric Young FTPEY
  Dennis Furguson FTPDF Mark Riordan FTPMR Phil Karn FTPPK
  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson PAT87

  FIPS 461 says The algorithm specified in this standard is to be
  implemented  using hardware not software technology  
  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in
  compliance with this standard  Despite this software
  implementations abound and are used by government agencies

 Can DES be used to protect classified information

  DES is not intended to protect classified data  FIPS 461 says
  This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for
  the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following
  conditions apply 1    cryptographic protection is required and
  2 the data is not classified according to the National Security Act
  of 1947 as amended or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended

 What are ECB CBC CFB and OFB encryption

  These are methods for using block ciphers such as DES to encrypt 
  messages files and blocks of data known as modes of operation
  Four modes of operation are defined in FIPS 81 1980 December 2 
  and also in ANSI X31061983   

  FIPS 81 specifies that when 7bit ASCII data is sent in octets the
  unused mostsignificant bit is to be set to 1
  FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks

  The four DES modes of operation are 
	Electronic Code Book  ECB 
	Cipher Block Chaining CBC 
	Kbit Cipher FeedBack CFB and 
	Kbit Output FeedBack OFB

  These methods are explained below in a clanguagelike notation

  Some symbols

  Pn	The nth block of plaintext input to encryption output from
  	decryption  Size of block determined by the mode

  Cn	The nth block of ciphertext output from encryption input to
  	decryption  Size of block determined by the mode

  Em	The DES encryption function performed on 64bit block m using
  	the 16key schedule derived from some 56bit key

  Dm	The DES decryption function performed on 64bit block m using
  	the same key schedule as in Em except that the 16 keys
  	in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in Em

  IV	A 64bit initialization vector a secret value which along with
  	the key is shared by both encryptor and decryptor

  In	The nth value of a 64bit variable used in some modes
  Rn	The nth value of a 64bit variable used in some modes

  LSBmk The k least significant rightmost bits of m
  	eg  m  1  k  1

  MSBmk The k most significant leftmost bits of m
  	eg  m  64k  1  k  1

        operators as defined in the c langage


  Electronic Code Book ECB

  	  Pn and Cn are each 64bits long

  	  Pn and Cn are each k bits long 1  k  64  

  	  Encryption			Decryption

  all n Cn  PnRn		Pn  CnRn

  	  Note that for k64 this reduces to

  	  I0  IV			I0  IV
  n0	  In  Cn1			In  Cn1	
  all n Rn  EIn		Rn  EIn
  all n Cn  PnRn		Pn  CnRn

  CFB notes Since In depends only on the plain or cipher text from the
  previous operation the E function can be performed in parallel with
  the reception of the text with which it is used


  kbit Output FeedBack OFB

  	  Pn and Cn are each k bits long 1  k  64  

  	  Encryption			Decryption
  	  I0  IV			I0  IV
  n0	  In  In1k  Rn1	In  In1k  Rn1	
  all n Rn  MSBEInk		Rn  MSBEInk
  all n Cn  PnRn		Pn  CnRn

  	  Note that for k64 this reduces to

  	  I0  IV			I0  IV
  n0	  In  Rn1			In  Rn1	
  all n Rn  EIn		Rn  EIn
  all n Cn  PnRn		Pn  CnRn

  OFB notes encryption and decryption are identical  Since In is
  independent of P and C the E function can be performed in advance of
  the receipt of the plaincipher text with which it is to be used


  Additional notes on DES modes of operation

  ECB and CBC use E to encrypt and D to decrypt but the feedback modes
  use E to both encrypt and decrypt  This disproves the erroneous claim
  that systems which feature E but not D cannot be used for data
  confidentiality and therefore are not subject to export controls
