 What is publickey cryptography

  In a classic cryptosystem we have encryption functions EK and
  decryption functions DK such that DKEKP  P for any plaintext
  P In a publickey cryptosystem EK can be easily computed from some
  public key X which in turn is computed from K X is published so
  that anyone can encrypt messages If DK cannot be easily computed
  from X then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages
  Thats the essence of publickey cryptography published by Diffie
  and Hellman in 1976

  In a classic cryptosystem if you want your friends to be able to
  send secret messages to you you have to make sure nobody other than
  them sees the key K In a publickey cryptosystem you just publish X
  and you dont have to worry about spies

  This is only the beginning of publickey cryptography There is an
  extensive literature on security models for publickey cryptography
  applications of publickey cryptography other applications of the
  mathematical technology behind publickey cryptography and so on

 Whats RSA

  RSA is a publickey cryptosystem defined by Rivest Shamir and
  Adleman  For full details there is a FAQ available by ftp at
  RSACOM Heres a small example

  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2512 Keys are quadruples
  pqed with p a 256bit prime number q a 258bit prime number
  and d and e large numbers with de  1 divisible by p1q1 We
  define EKP  Pe mod pq DKC  Cd mod pq

  Now EK is easily computed from the pair pqebut as far as
  anyone knows there is no easy way to compute DK from the pair
  pqe So whoever generates K can publish pqe Anyone can send a
  secret message to him he is the only one who can read the messages

 Is RSA secure

  Nobody knows An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q
  See below for comments on how fast stateoftheart factorization
  algorithms run Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to
  prove that factorizationor any realistic problem at all for that
  matteris inherently slow It is easy to formalize what we mean by
  RSA isisnt strong but as Hendrik W Lenstra Jr says
  Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to
  prove that algorithms with certain properties do not exist and
  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative
  results

 How fast can people factor numbers

  It depends on the size of the numbers In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra
  and Dan Bernstein factored 2523  1 into primes using about three
  weeks of MasPar time The MasPar is a 16384processor SIMD machine
  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second The
  algorithm there is called the number field sieve it is quite a
  bit faster for special numbers like 2523  1 than for general numbers
  n but it takes time only about expOlog13 n log23 log n in
  any case

  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the multiple
  polynomial quadratic sieve which takes time expOlog12 n
  log12 log nfaster than the number field sieve for small n
  but slower for large n The breakeven point is somewhere between 100
  and 150 digits depending on the implementations

  Factorization is a fastmoving fieldthe state of the art just a few
  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now If no new methods are
  developed then 2048bit RSA keys will always be safe from
  factorization but one cant predict the future Before the number
  field sieve was found many people conjectured that the quadratic
  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be

 What about other publickey cryptosystems

  Weve talked about RSA because its well known and easy to describe
  But there are lots of other publickey systems around many of which
  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be
  difficult This has been just a brief introduction if you really want
  to learn about the many facets of publickey cryptography consult the
  books and journal articles listed in part 10
