FAQ for scicrypt part 7 Digital Signatures and Hash Functions

This is the seventh of ten parts of the scicrypt FAQ The parts are
mostly independent but you should read the first part before the rest
We dont have the time to send out missing parts by mail so dont ask
Notes such as KAH67 refer to the reference list in the last part

The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfmmitedu

 What is a oneway hash function

  A typical oneway hash function takes a variablelength message and
  produces a fixedlength hash Given the hash it is computationally
  impossible to find a message with that hash in fact one cant
  determine any usable information about a message with that hash not
  even a single bit For some oneway hash functions its also
  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the
  same hash

  A oneway hash function can be private or public just like an
  encryption function Heres one application of a public oneway hash
  function like MD5 or Snefru Most publickey signature systems are
  relatively slow To sign a long message may take longer than the user
  is willing to wait Solution Compute the oneway hash of the message
  and sign the hash which is short Now anyone who wants to verify the
  signature can do the same thing

  Another name for oneway hash function is message digest function

 What is the difference between public private secret shared etc

  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a
  very small set of concepts When an algorithm depends on a key which
  isnt published we call it a private algorithm otherwise we call it
  a public algorithm We have encryption functions E and decryption
  functions D so that DEM  M for any message M We also have
  hashing functions H and verification functions V such that VMX  1
  if and only if X  HM

  A publickey cryptosystem has public encryption and private
  decryption Checksums such as the application mentioned in the
  previous question have public hashing and public verification
  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public
  verification only one person can produce the hash for a message
  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct

  Obviously when an algorithm depends on a private key its meant to
  be unusable by anyone who doesnt have the key Theres no real
  difference between a shared key and a private key a shared key
  isnt published so its private If you encrypt data for a friend
  rather than for your eyes only are you suddenly doing
  sharedkey encryption rather than privatekey encryption No

 What are MD4 and MD5

  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest
  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 see part 10 Code is
  available from FTPMD

  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft
  RFC The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a though some
  people refer to it as MD5

 What is Snefru

  Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph
  Merkle Snefru8 is an 8round function the newest in the family
  Definitions appear in Merkles paper ME91a Code is available from
  FTPSF
