Subject Re How do they know what keys to ask for Re Clipper

And of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company and
since the phone company complies with court orders they will know the
magic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you and
then can present the warrant to the key escrow house

  Who makes them forget and destroy all copies of the key once theyve
decided youre not a criminal today  Just curious
