Subject Nonword password generator

Does anyone know of a nonword password generator program
for PCs ie it will produce a nonsense word but still
be pronouncible eg lisgollan

Wanted to force users to adopt more secure passwords
but still be memorable

Thanks  George Bolt

ps please email me as well if possible georgepsychmipsyorkacuk
