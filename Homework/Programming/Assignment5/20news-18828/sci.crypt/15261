   Stupid me I believed the Democrats stood for principles of personal
   privacy while it was the Neanderthal Republicans that wanted into every
   aspect of our lives 
   Clinton is just more clever than the other guy Looks like gun control for
   privacy technology One small step at a time

Remember Defend Firearms  Defeat Dukakis followed by Bushs soonafter
election support for guncontrol   This is the Democrats version
Defend Free Speech  Reject Republicans followed by speech control

   Wait a minute  Let me think about this

   Hmmm I feel better now I believe the White House when they tell us
   this first step is in fact the final step All is OK Weve nothing to fear
   Theyre here to help us   God bless America
 
Hey like the grrreat JR Bob Dobbs says youve got to pull the
wool over your own eyes


				Pray for peace      Bill
