Subject White House Wiretap Chip Disinformation Sheet

Fascinating  Most of the content of the White House announcements was
in what was not said  It gives us almost nothing of value threatens to
take away a lot and does it with a sincere smile on its face
and the nice friendly word Management

			      FACT SHEET
		     PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The first thing it doesnt say is Were giving you stronger encryption
what it says is 
   the U S Government has developed a microcircuit that not only
   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust
   than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of
   the keys needed to unlock the encryption  The system for the
   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to
   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization
But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now
so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break
At best it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break since they
need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a bruteforce search
for the other 40bit key

Similarly it didnt say Were making encryption is commercially available
because encryption is already commercially available including
forms the NSA may not be able to break like tripleDES or IDEA
And phone companies could offer DESbased systems now if they were
convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money

The next thing it didnt say is Were making encryption legal
because of course encryption has always been legal and the
President cant change the First Amendment merely by decree
What it did say was
	In making this decision I do not intend to prevent the
	private sector from developing or the government from approving
	other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in
	assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system
which clearly means Were making encryption illegal unless we get your keys
Soon  Once business buys into this

Another thing it didnt say is Were going to ask Congress for money
to do lots more wiretapping because of course theres a budget crisis
and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash
What it did say was
   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
   the extent needed to preserve the governments ability to conduct
   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
   law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase
which means Weve got money Congress cant control and were going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NONAPPROVED CRYPTO
thats what preserve the governments ability to conduct  surveillance 
means  

				Pray for peace      Bill
