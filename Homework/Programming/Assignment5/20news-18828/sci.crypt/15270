But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much
worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main
concern of most of us I think The camels nose in the tent etc

Excuse me  This has already happened  Theres a couple of humps in
the tent already  Ask the folks at Qualcomm what became of the
nontrivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their CDMA
digitial cellular phone standard  There already are restrictions in
place
