And of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company and
since the phone company complies with court orders they will know the
magic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you and
then can present the warrant to the key escrow house


Lets hope Years ago a Telecom tech refused to tap a line unless he saw the 
warrant The managment type who told him to do it fired him The appeal
against the dismissal was lost

   Who makes them forget and destroy all copies of the key once theyve
 decided youre not a criminal today  Just curious

Good luck

Paul
