Subject Re White House Public Encryption Management Fact Sheet


I have a question about digital communications encryption

	The Fact Sheet mentioned encryptiondecryption microcircuitry with 
special keys for law enforcement for wire tapping purposes

	If I wanted to couldnt I develop  encryption of my own  That
is if me and a partner in crime had unique Encryptiondecryption
devices installed before the tappable one couldnt we circumvent
the keys system  Or replace it

	Id be really interested in knowing how the ED microcircuits might
be made to prevent such befuddlement Laymans Language please maybe a bit
technical

Please Email to me as Im not in Net News as much as Id like to be
