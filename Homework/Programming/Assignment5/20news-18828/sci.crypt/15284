Subject Clipper  some new thoughts

Id desparately prefer it if we didnt rehash the same arguments
that went on ad infinitum last time  Thats especially true for
scicrypt  For that matter Ive created altprivacyclipper since
the traffic is appearing in many different groups right now

Im going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my
followup to scicrypt  Frankly if youre not an absolutist your
feelings may turn on some of these issues  For example  with an
80bit key simply splitting it into two 40bit pieces is much less
acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one
repository is shall we say overly pliable a wouldbe eavesdropper
would need to recover just 40 more bits of key  I need not point out
in this newsgroup that thats pretty easy to do by exhaustive search
A slightly more complex scheme  XORing the key with a random number
and then with its complement  would produce two 80bit subkeys
neither of which is useful alone  That variant is much more resistant
to attack  Clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect
the subkeys even more

Other thoughts  Some people have noted the size and complexity of
the databases necessary  But the id strings the phones emit could be
their back door key doubleencrypted with the escrow repositories
public keys  For that matter they could do that only with session
keys and have no back door at all  In that case the FBI would have
to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted  This
would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you
make sure they stop

We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back
door  have the switch do the tap but with a digitallysigned record
of the time phone number etc of the call  That provides proof to
the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of
the warrant

I can suggest other variations too  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100
public key pairs  Each would be used 10 times after which youd need
more keying material  Not a bad idea in any event  This could be
used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant
the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldnt last for very
long

I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure  Apart from
the obvious  why push a weak algorithm when youve already got the
back door  I think that the government is still genuinely concerned
about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets  This
scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too  Ive heard
rumors over the years that some factions within NSA were unhappy with
DES because it was too good  Not that they couldnt crack it but it
was much too expensive to do so as easily as theyd want  Theyre keeping
the details secret so that others dont build their own implementations
without the back door

The cryptographic protocol though is another matter  I see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret and  as I hope Ive shown above  there
are a lot of ways to do things that arent quite as bad
