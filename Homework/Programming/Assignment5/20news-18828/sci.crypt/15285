Subject How does it really work was Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption

This announcement is somewhat disconcerting it doesnt do anything
evil in and of itself but bodes badly for the future of open
algorithms and standards in information security  I wont start
panicking untilunless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited but
Im a little anxious  No doubt it wont be long before someone posts
explaining how this just a small part of some farranging and
longlived NSAPKPIRSFBICIAHandgunControlIncClinton conspiracy to
subvert freedom democracy and mathematics  My feeling is that the
administration probably isnt that worried about things like DES and
RSA and PGP and RIPEM since theyll never be used by a group much
wider than us computer geeks

The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things

1  The NSA has been working on this for a long time and it only just
    now happened to be ready to release to the world at this time

2  The NSA has been working on this for a long time but wasnt able
    to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan  I
    find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy
    for the unescrowed use of cryptography more likely the
    administration felt that even escrowed secretalgorithm and for
    all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be made
    widely available

Thus said clippercsrcncslnistgov Clipper Chip Announcement
This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to
pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations  Does anyone
know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
signals  The language sort of suggests this but its hard to say

The main thing I just dont get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques  Anybody know

Im guessing symmetric but they dont get very clear about it  If it
is symmetric how is it useful for anything other than linklevel
encryption with an identical chip at each end  How can you negotiate
a persession key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted
third party who knows your key  Or does it even use a persession
key

If its asymmetric what about PKPs patents which they claim cover
all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography  Are they getting
royalties or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the
algorithm secret
