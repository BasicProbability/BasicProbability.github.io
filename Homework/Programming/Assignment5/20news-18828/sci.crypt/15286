Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

I change login passwords every couple of months  I sure would suck if I had
to get a new sparc station everytime I wanted to do this  It seems that this
is what they expect you to do if you want to routinely change your password
on your phone  Im sure the government contractor doesnt mind but a system
where you can cheaply change keys DES has inherent security advantages 
regardless of the algorithms involved
 
Tim Cuffel	Finger for PGP 21  The CIA has admitted that the assassination
                                    of Saddam Hussien was one of their goals
They failed of course  Seems as though that motorcade through downtown Dallas
trick only works once
