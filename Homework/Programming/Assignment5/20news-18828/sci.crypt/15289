 Try reading between the lines David  there are strong hints in there 
 that theyre angling for NREN next

Where  I honestly didnt see any

 and the only conceivable meaning of 
 applying this particular technology to a computer network is that they 
 intend it to be used in exclusion to any other means of encryption 

I disagree if for no other reason than that there are already other 
standards in place  Besides even if they restrict encryption on the NREN 
who cares  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway  The NREN is only for 
geovernment and university research read the proposalsits a data 
superhighway for Cray users not anything having to do with the Internet
