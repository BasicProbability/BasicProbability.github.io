 Try reading between the lines David  there are strong hints in there
 that theyre angling for NREN next and the only conceivable meaning of
 applying this particular technology to a computer network is that they
 intend it to be used in exclusion to any other means of encryption

Umm  I beg to differ with the phrase only conceivable meaning
The SDNS protocols for example make explicit provision for multiple
encryption systems as does PEM  And Id love to see how theyd
mandate this new system for PEM without disclosing it

Mind you Im not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be
used  but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them which
certainly casts doubt on your choice of words
