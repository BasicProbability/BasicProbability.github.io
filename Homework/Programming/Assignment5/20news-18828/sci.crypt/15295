Subject Re Dont fight Clipper Chip subvert or replace it

 Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
 or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
 provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
 systems
 
 RSA might be in position to do it if they had active cooperation of
 a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones

 Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this  I for one
 would gladly pay royalties via purchasing secure phones


Hear hear I completely agree that we need to work quickly to
establish alternatives to the governments Clinton Clipper As Brad
Templeton and others have noted once the Clipper becomes ensconced in
enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the legal
standard and it will become the market standard as well There is
a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is
mandated about whether nonescrow alternatives will be allowed etc

There are also unclear issues about how hard or how illegal it will
be to make workalikes which meet the standard but which generate
phony or untappable keysIm sure the next several weeks will see
these issues thrashed out in this and other groups

Meanwhile Id be interested to hear RSA Data Securitys reaction
Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies the usual
complaints about MailSafe costing too much at 125 or so and the
general issue of software patents we may find that allying
ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do Whats a mere
licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake If everyone who
wanted true security paid say 100 for a lifetime use of all of
RSAs patentswhich expire in the period 19982002 or sothen RSA
would make tons of money and be happy Im sure A small price to pay
For those to whom 100 sounds like too much Im sure the actual terms
could be different spread out over several years whatever To me
its a small price to pay

Strong crypto means strong privacy Escrowing keys sending copies of
keys to large databases and splitting keys into two 40bit pieces
all done with secret and nonanalyzable protocols and algorithms is
NOT strong crypto

Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of
patenting number theory applications this minor issue pales in
comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal note
that I said potentialwell presumably learn more in the coming
months

The RSA algorithms are at least public have been analyzed and
attacked for years and source code is available to better ensure no
deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors

I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems
using offtheshelf hardware like Soundblaster boards for the PC and
CELPtype software The new generations of PCs using fast 486s and
Pentiums are fast enough to do realtime voice encryption Combined
with DiffieHellman key exchange this should provide an alternative
to the Clipper system

Of course we dont really know if the Administration proposes to
outlaw competing systems It seems to me that their goal of tapping
terrorists child pornographers and Hilary bashers would be thwarted
if lowcost alternatives to Clipper proliferated Not to defend child
pornographers or terrorists but limiting basic freedoms to catch a
few criminals is not the American way of doing things End of soapbox
mode

I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had
with RSA and dont look at meI have both MacPGP and a fully
legal copy of MailSafe and instead work with them as quickly as we can

RSA Jim are you listening

PS I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn
out that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal
