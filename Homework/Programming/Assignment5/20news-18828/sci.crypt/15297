 Oh great Wonderful news Nobody can listen inexcept the feds 

Hey its better than the status quo

I am far less worried about the feds tapping my phone than high school 
scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
cordless phone calls


Really Why are so you worried about high school kids getting their kicks
with scanners as compared to what the feds can do and have done to their
targets

Better than the status quo isnt good enough Id say The same 
technology could be implemented WITHOUT a back door open to the state

We all know about power and corruption But we all know that abuse is
something that only happens to the other guy
