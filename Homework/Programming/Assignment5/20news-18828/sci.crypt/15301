The main thing I just dont get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques  Anybody know

I dont know but Im as willing to speculate as anyone

Several people have suggested that the chips use publickey cryptography
Another possibility is to use DiffieHellman key exchange or some other
algorithm which has a similar effect  DH allows both ends to agree on
a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography something
like DES for the encryption

How could the back door keys work in this system  I can see a few
possibilities  One is that the DHlike algorithm has the property that
the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door
keys for one or possibly both communicants  Perhaps the random numbers
used in the DH are seeded by the back door key or some such

Another possibility as was suggested here earlier is that the chips
simply broadcast the session key encrypted with the chips own
internal secret key  In this system the back door keys are secret keys
usable for decrypting this session key broadcast  Actually the chips
secret key doesnt need to be a public key in this usage but can be
identical to the secret backdoor key  This proposal seems most
straightforward to me

Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the
message itself has a dual key property that possession of either of
two keys can be used to decrypt it  One key would be the session key from
the DH exchange and the other would be the back door key for the chip

Its worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised
during her amazingly prescient online discussion last November and
December was a variation on DiffieHellman in which a third party would
participate in deriving the session keys  This doesnt quite fit into
what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early
knowledge of Clipper or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with
Clipper designers may have had DiffieHellman on their minds
