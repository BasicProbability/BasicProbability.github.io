It looks like Dorothy Dennings wrongheaded ideas have gotten to the
Administration even sooner than we feared

Id lay long odds that it was the other way around  Clinton didnt
just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices the NSA has to have
been working on it for years  While its possible that Denning and
other prominent people just happened to start arguing for such a
system it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved
If this guess is wrong I apologize
