Subject Remote file system security

In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals Id love to
see a UNIXbased encryption scheme that

1 Kept some files encrypted on the host machine say all the files in your
   home directory
2 Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a
   modem line

It seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a
way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not among other things

Id love to know about potential security holes in such a system

Does such a system exist  If it were made easytouse and readily
available I think it would be a Good Thingtm  I realize that this
would probably just involve putting a nice frontend on a readily available
and very secure encryption scheme but it should be done

Thanks for the ear
Brad
