And yes this has to be a public key system or it would be almost
impossible to handle  It might not be RSA but that does not mean
that PKP doesnt get paid  Until 1997 PKP has the patent on the
general concept of public key encryption as well as the particular
implementation known as RSA

Hmm my first thought was that theyre using DiffieHellman exponential
session key exchange or an equivalent  However the DiffieHellman
patent like the HellmanMerkle one on public key systems claims
all equivalents so the basic point stands

Interestingly a quote from Jim Bidzos showed up in the media real
soon after the announcement and he sounded very pissed  Maybe he hadnt
yet realized that PKP might have just struck gold  All they have to
do is get someone to admit the general scheme that the Clipper uses
