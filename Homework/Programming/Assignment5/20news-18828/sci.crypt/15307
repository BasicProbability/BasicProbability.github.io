You    The keyphrase is I confess to deliberately evading copyright

Judge and CP Oh
     How will they get you now Im not saying that they wont or
cant or even that they shouldnt  but what legal mechanism will
they use Should we be crossposting this to misclegal

Hm could another court try you via a bypass of the double jeopardy amendment
like they are doing in the LAPD trial  Ie your judge is a state judge and
then a federal judge retries you under the justification that its not the
same trail

    No The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California
on charges of police brutality and secondly by the Federal Government
on depriving RK of his civil rights  a different crime

    The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial
Ollie confessed to treason aiding an enemy of the US during Senate
hearings under immunity The team which was later to prosecute him on
criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ONs
immunized testimony ONs lawyer brought up the probability that at
least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony and it
was a strong factor against the prosecution which is one of the
reasons this ON is still walking around free today
