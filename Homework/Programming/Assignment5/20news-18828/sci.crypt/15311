Subject Re How to detect use of an illegal cipher

In article C5nMB1CoFnewsclaremontedu ebrandtjarthurclaremontedu Eli Brandt writes

I probably shouldnt say this but they could try to detect the use
of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
properties of the plaintext  An oldfashioned wiretap could then
detect the use of preencryption which would drastically increase
the measured entropy of the input  A countermeasure to this would
be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice

This way to detect preencryption may be defeated  one can do  
transformation of the spectrum of encrypted signal just by adding some 
prearranged in the beginning of communication function
I think so Say you can do FFT of your encrypted signal
Just thinking
