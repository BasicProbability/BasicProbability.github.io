Q   Who was consulted  The Congress  Industry

A   We have ongoing discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative

Congress  So were playing politics before we talk to CPSR academia
the public internet users  Ive heard of topdown design but topdown 
democracy Just whose statedistrict are the chip manufacturers in

Q   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices

A   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review bs about
     the wonderfulness of the key escrow system

     The Administration is not saying since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement
     we will prohibit it outright as some countries have
     effectively done 

Theyll just provide an easilycompromised version to JQ Public

                         nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product  

Maybe we need a CRA  Cryptographic Rights Amendment

                                                  There is a
     false tension created in the assessment that this issue is
     an eitheror proposition  Rather both concerns can be
     and in fact are harmoniously balanced through a reasoned
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the Clipper
     Chip and similar encryption techniques

Nice lullaby  But why am I not soothed

In article 15472lelandStanfordEDU arclelandStanfordEDU Andrew Richard Conway writes
PS I cant work out why the US government doesnt want to sell
them overseas After all they are rather easy for US interests to decode
so make a perfect tool for industrialmilitary espionagelulling 
anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security You will
notice that there is NO mention anywhere about safety for nonAmericans


Why repeat themselves  It appears to some and the story looks pretty
convincing to me too that the Justice Department stole a casetracking
system modified it and distributed it to friendly police and suchlike
agencies around the world eg the Canadian Mounties  Of course I have 
no doubt they swore Scouts Honor that there were no backdoors

With that kind of intelligence whod want to be swamped with terabytes
of commercial traffic
