 The message from the NIST about the clipper chip comes from the
 following address
 
 	clippercsrcncslnistgov Clipper Chip Announcement
 
 Just who is that I asked myself or rather I asked the computer
 
      telnet csrcncslnistgov 25
list of name elided for brevity
 
 Well isnt that interesting  Dorothy Denning Mitch Kapor Marc
 Rotenberg Ron Rivest Jim Bidzos and others  The Government RSA
 TIS CPSR and the EFF are all represented  I dont suppose anybody
 within any of these organizations would care to comment  Or is this
 just the White Houses idea of a cruel joke on these peoples inboxes

I know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard
of Clipper was in the Friday morning newspaper And another has
already fired off a letter of protest to NIST

My point I suspect this list interesting as it is for various
reasons does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together
Some of them yes Others no 

This may be nothing more than a mailing list of people who get
cryptorelated announcements from NSA er I mean NIST
