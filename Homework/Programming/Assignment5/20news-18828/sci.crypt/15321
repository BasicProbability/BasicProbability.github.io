Before we can have a global multimedia email solution there must be some
definition of a minimum service level and MIME does not provide for this
yet  

Before the Internet will invest in software people need to see content 
I would suggest that 50 attractive MIME formatted news messages a day would be
sufficient to get a few people thinking about adding MIME support to news
readers esp if the content is really worth it

IMHO we have a long way to go before the Unixspecific MUAs newsreaders etc
reach the service levels of the other commercial platforms  There ought to be
such a definition consisting of known object data types and rules for their
handling included in the transport specification document

Yes  But there is also a long way to go before most Mac PC and Windows
MUAs and newsreaders are ready to handle the sheer volume of news and mail
that many Unix specific tools are able to cope with  When the choice is
more feechurs or make the damn thing fast enough to keep up with the
flood you have to bet that fast enough wins

Ed as usual makes a very good point

One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an email  He composed it using the
Sun OpenWindows 3 mailtool which handles nonMIME attachments and the
like

Since I dont use mailtool I had to manually save it cut  paste and
then uudecode the actual attachment  What I got  after a notinconsiderable
amount of time spent doing this  was an audio file  The original message
was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data the resulting audio message
was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message

If he had sent me the sentence in plain text the email would have been
around 250 bytes and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at
most  Instead it was 32k and it took at least a minute  A complete waste of
my time and bandwidth as far as Im concerned  Sending plain text is still
the most efficient method of transmission given the same transport mechanism
I shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their Usenet
articles as audio files instead of plain text  Meltdown of the Net predicted
Film at Eleven

Back to Mono	

This subthread no longer has anything to do with PEM or administrative
policy so Ive redirected followups back to compmailmime   Greg
