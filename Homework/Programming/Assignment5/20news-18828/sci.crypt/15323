Subject Re Dont fight Clipper Chip subvert or replace it 

The Clipper chip is just the culmination of Dorthy Denning et all
But lets ignore that for the moment

The fundamental question isCan the government stop me from using
encryption

Ignoring for the moment the question of patented processes such as
Public Keys can the government stop me from using an encryption
process

If the answer is yes then what freedom we have in this country is
truly gone and its time to get out the guns or the lawyers
depending upon which causes more damage and to whom

However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please who
cares about the clipper chip As far as Im concerned a phone line
is insecure PERIOD I dont care if they encrypt it 10 ways from
sunday if I didnt do the encrypting I dont trust it This is the
attitude that everyone else should have Instead of worrying about a
clipper chip simply connect your handset to your computer and feed
the voice single through process encrypt and transmit over the
phone The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse

Cant work you say No Standard you say Obviously you have never
uses PGP

Anyone who expects the government to protect their freedoms is
kidding themselves Only you can protect your own freedoms

One final thought addressed to EFF
	1Do you support the implementation of ANY form of
	encryption where the encryption key must be revealed
	2If you do why If not why
	3What SPECIFIC actions are you planning to take to either
	support or stop this proposal
	4If you do not support this proposal what alternatives do
	you offer
