It looks like Dorothy Dennings wrongheaded ideas have gotten to the
Administration even sooner than we feared

Id lay long odds that it was the other way around  Clinton didnt
just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices the NSA has to have
been working on it for years  While its possible that Denning and
other prominent people just happened to start arguing for such a
system it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved
If this guess is wrong I apologize

Im sure Dorothy Denning is an honest person and wouldnt lie to us
Simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement but be
very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no Jesuitical
evasion or a true but wholly misleading answer

In this country MI5 are experts at answering these questions for
instance there was a British journalist Jonathon Moyle killed in South
America a couple of years ago  Parliament asked Was he an MI5 employee
No  turns out afterwards he wasnt paid therefore wasnt an employee
They could equally have said he wasnt an agent  he went abroad on his
private business with no brief from MI5 but was interviewed and debriefed
at length only on his return
