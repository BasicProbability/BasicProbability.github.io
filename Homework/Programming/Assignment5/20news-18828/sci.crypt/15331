 that seems available and unguessable by an intruder when a Unix is

A few more sources are statistics on your filesystems easily
and quickly obtained and the output from the rusage system
call  

You can also exec a finger to one or more favorite heavilyused
systems though this can take several seconds

cf the source code to RIPEM on ripemmsuedu
