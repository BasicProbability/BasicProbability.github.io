But is it any worse than the current unsecure system It becomes much
worse of course if the government then uses this Clinton Clipper
to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption This is the main
concern of most of us I think The camels nose in the tent etc


	Not to pick on Mr May in particular of course but isnt this
kind of the domino theory When one little country falls its neighbor
will surely follow and before you know it were all mining salt
in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings

	Surely the hypothesis relying on the least wild assumptions is
to take this at face value Our lads at the fort were asked to cook up
something thats pretty secure with a key that can be escrowed neatly
and they did The government plans to sell this thing for the reasons
they state Yes those evil guys in the FBI can probably with some
effort abuse the system I got news for you if the evil guys in
the FBI decide they want to persecute you theyre gonna and youre
gonna hate it Fact is the FBI doesnt want to listen to your phone
calls and if they do and if youre using tripleDES theyll just
get a parabolic microphone and point it at your head

	With EMail if they cant break your PGP encryption theyll just
call up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic emmisions
from your computer or terminal  Note that measures to protect yourself from
TEMPEST surveillance are still classified as far as I know

	This is pretty clearly an effort by the government to do exactly
what theyre saying theyre doing As is typical with governments
its mismanaged and full of holes and compromises As is typical
with our government its not too bad could be worse

	My interpretation

	Andrew

Tim May whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime
                           

	Isnt this just a little melodramatic

	If the new regime comes to fruition make sure you protect your First
Amendment rights by asserting your Second Amendment Rights
