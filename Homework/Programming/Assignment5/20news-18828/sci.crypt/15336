Though some may argue about the nose of the camel its worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony If it is only
used for that purpose and does not extend to electronic mail or file
encryption then it IS an improvement over the current massproduced
standard civilian technology which with a few exceptions is limited to
easytobreak inverters

Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap
Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
email and files lets focus on this

One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it

Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some I find the proposal
less threatening than many others since right now most Americans have no
secure telephony and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a goat can
eavesdrop This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and
cordless phones



Reading between the lines I infer that the system is highly secure
without access to the keys This would meet the needs of US businesses
confronted by rich and powerful adversaries including French and Japanese
security services and rich Japanese companies It allows the NSA to make
available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs

Most legitimate US corporations trust the NSA and would be delighted to
have a highsecurity system certified by them even at the price of
depositing keys in escrow I see no difficulty in creating a reliable
escrow Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the
week and that system has worked pretty well

From my point of view this is a fair starting point There are concerns that
need to be addressed including the reliability of the escrows But in
return we get access to highsecurity crypto Many have suggested that DES
and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly
skilled and endowed There is at least a good possibility which should be
checked that the proposed system is not so breakable It doesnt have to
be nor does it have to have trapdoors if the government can get the keys
pursuant to a legitimate court order Thus they can protect legitimate
communications against economic adversaries while still being able to
eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order

	Let me ask you this  Would you trust Richard Nixon with your
crypto keys  I wouldnt
