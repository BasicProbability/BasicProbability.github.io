Yes those evil guys in the FBI can probably with some
effort abuse the system I got news for you if the evil guys in
the FBI decide they want to persecute you theyre gonna 

And if Richard Nixon had had this kind of toy he wouldnt have had
to send people into the Watergate


	This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the antichrist
Just for the hell of it lets destroy this remark Let us imagine that
the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses
without anyone knowing or telling Now what Dick has 80 bits of data
What the hells he gonna do with it

	1 Trot around to the telco and say wed like an unauthorised
decrypting tap Uh huh
	2 Break in to watergate and install his own tap so his people still
do have to break in neat huh record some noise then get the Executive
Branch Phone Decryption Box huh theyve got one Goodness wait til the
washington post gets hold of this and decrypt the noise
	3 More likely stare at the key and say Oh hell its not
worth all this bloody hassle

	Truth is even granted lots of covert power on the part of
the Executive Branch this system is more difficult to tap with than
POTS gear The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical
system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither
here nor there

	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are

	a is the key really just chopped in half and not some XOR
arrangement That is has some egregious technical error been built
in to the plan
	b is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong
encryption


But thats not really the issue  The real issue is whether this 
will be used to justify a ban against individuals use of private 
ie anything else encryption methods

	This is b of course I suspect not If the government actually
wanted to make such regs theyd just do it A few hundred people on Usenet
yelling about it wouldnt even slow the machine down

	Besides who is this mysterious they whos going to take away
all our rights the instant we let our guard down Congress That gang
of buffoons cant even balance their checkbooks The FBI But they
dont make the laws The NSA Ditto The white house Bill Clinton
is probably still looking for the bathroom Its a big place after all
