Heres a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
one Make it voluntary

That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own


As long as you are on your own means that you can use your own encryption
Im sold

Bruce

As am I

If high quality secure NSA classified technology means handing my key
over to whomever Ill take PGP any day

Right now they are billing it as voluntary ie bend over here it comes

As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there how much
easier do you think it will be to redefine on your own to mean
write it yourself and dont even THINK about distributing it

Get honest no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW its compromised
already and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed

The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means
handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process
Since when has export control stopped anyone especially software wise

Ask yourself carefully if  high quality secure NSA classified technology 
is something they are going to hand out  Not unless you can drive a
NSA van through the holes
