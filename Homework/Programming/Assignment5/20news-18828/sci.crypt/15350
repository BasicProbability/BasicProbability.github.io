Subject Clipper chip and key exchange methods

   I was wanting to ask the same question Dan Bernstein askedhow does the
Clipper chip exchange keys  If the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long
does anyone know of any publickey schemes that are secure with that key
size  DiffieHellman or maybe El Gamal with p set to a constant value
   Presumably the real scheme is something like
 
   1  Exchangeverify public keys
   2  Send encrypted randomlygenerated session key
   3  Encrypt  Decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher
 
   Can anyone elaborate on this or show me what Im missing here
