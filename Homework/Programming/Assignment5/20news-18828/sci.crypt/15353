	With EMail if they cant break your PGP encryption theyll just
call up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic emmisions
from your computer or terminal  Note that measures to protect yourself from
TEMPEST surveillance are still classified as far as I know

I dont know about classified but I do seem to remember that unless
youre authorized by the Govt its illegal to TEMPESTshield your
equipment  Besides effective TEMPESTshielding is much more
difficult than you might think hi Jim

The NSA is now funding research not only in cryptography but in all areas
of advanced mathematics If youd like a circular describing these new
research opportunities just pick up your phone call your mother and
ask for one
