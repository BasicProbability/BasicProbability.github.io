views would be to recruit them as spooks They can be guaranteed to give
the government line when it counts In US history it has been the 
socialists such as myself who have been persecuted 

  And in Russia capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
black market And in the US capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
for things such as selling drugs guns pornography and other victimless
activities  It doesnt matter whether you are socialist or capitalist
power and control are central to government Since citizens cant be trusted to
run their own affairs the government must watch them  for their
own good of course I mean with strong cryptography citizens might gasp
start to hide things from the IRS sell drugsgunspornography and
that cannot be allowed

trials Ever seen Ed Meese pissed I have it was when he said that socialism
and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter
It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious

  Not very surprising to anyone who believes in hands off government If
you believe that your private life both social and financial are none of
anyone elses business the difference between socialism and communism is
like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by
chainsaw The more centralized the economy is the more potential
abuses for accumulation of information on individuals If you think
credit companies are bad   Well Im sure a democratic socialist society
would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens  NOT
