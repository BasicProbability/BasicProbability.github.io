Subject Re Clipper chip  technical details

Thus said djbsilvertonberkeleyedu D J Bernstein
Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says There is
a global key G plus one key UC for each chip C The user can choose a
new session key KP for each phone call P he makes Chip C knows three
keys G its own UC and the users KP The government as a whole
knows G and every UC Apparently a message M is encrypted as
EGEUCKPC  EKPM Thats it

The system as described here cant possibly work What happens when
someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M
the receiving chip needs KP to get KP the receiving chip needs UC
The only information it can work with is C If UC can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key
escrow is bullshit Otherwise how is a message decrypted

Given the description of the algorithm given the only plausible
explantion I can find is that KP must be agreed to out of bandwidth
in advance by the two parties ie its a standard shared symmetric
key
