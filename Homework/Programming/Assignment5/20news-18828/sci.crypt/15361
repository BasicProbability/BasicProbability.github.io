Subject Re What the clipper naysayers sound like to me

 a bunch of wellmeaning maybe cynnical text about screwthread
	sizes the rights of people to have their own standards
	and the nonright of the gov to regulate screwthreads

Well as funny as your little comment may seem it has very little to
do with your personal privacy as a citizen and about the governemnt
being able to look at everything you have ever typed into a computer
at one point or another

This Clipper Chip stuff is the seeds for nightmares to make the 
Nightmare on Elmstreet cheeseoncelluloid movies look like episodes
of Mr Rogers Neighborhood

IF the gov establishes a cryptography standard that has to be used by
everyone and everyones personal key is divided into two segments
and stored at two separate albeit easy to find places and that key is
only 80 bits to begin with we are screwed pardon the allusion to the 
afforementioned article

the gov I believe as do many others probably already have the cracking chips
for this Clipper Chip made  Hell they probably based the encoder on the 
chip that cracks it that way its easier to break the code but since it is a 
classified algorythm no one knows that they can crack it so easily

I for one and quite scared of this kind of thing and plan to support 
organizations and even disorganizations who are fighting against this
Clipper Chip in any way that I can

I do not want the government to be able to have access even with a search
warrant to my keys and I dont want those keys to be only 80 bits long
to begin with
