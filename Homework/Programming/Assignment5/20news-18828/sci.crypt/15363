What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
flames please  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies

Id be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

Id be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms

Id trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsId be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

Id trust something from the NSA long before Id trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese

A lot of us out here in the hinderland will trust the Japanese
before well trust the NSA the President or those stupid
Fortune 50 companies youre so proud of

This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
one very famous CEO put it to me one day

Just some perspective from another point of view

And since the Japanese corps arent part of our governmentgovernors
they may be more trusted out htere than you are


People are getting tired of this be patriotic do whatever we say
without question and pay more taxes attitude that comes from
Americas political party
or should that be caste
