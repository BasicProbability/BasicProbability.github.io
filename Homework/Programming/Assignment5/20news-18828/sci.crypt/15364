	With EMail if they cant break your PGP encryption theyll just
call up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic emmisions
from your computer or terminal  Note that measures to protect yourself from
TEMPEST surveillance are still classified as far as I know

1 I dont think they are classified

2 I could independently invent about half a dozen right off
the top of my head If I had studied Advanced E  M a little better
I could probably come up with a very good system


	If the new regime comes to fruition make sure you protect your First
Amendment rights by asserting your Second Amendment Rights
