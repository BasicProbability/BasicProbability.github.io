Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

In article 1993Apr1706132616130clarinetcom bradclarinetcom Brad Templeton writes
   Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access  The
   telco isnt supposed to give that without a warrant  Thats the rule today

   But even so the evidence would not be admissible I think unless the
   judge so ordered  I think that even interception of the crypttext
   without a warrant would be illegal   Cops cant record todays plain
   cellular calls and then ask a judge Hey can we have permission to
   listen to those tapes can they

How long do you think it will be before it becomes legal for the
police to record encrypted conversations Its not violating your
privacy because we cant read the encryption without a warrant with the usual
goodfaith exception if they accidentally record a nonencrypted conversation

Besides its covered by the Drug Exception to the Fourth Amendment
