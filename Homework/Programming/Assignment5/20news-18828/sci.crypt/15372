    The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
    the extent needed to preserve the governments ability to conduct
    lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
    law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
    shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
    Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase

This is a very curious thing to say STUIIIs NSAdesigned secure
telephones cleared for classified traffic are already readily
available to law enforcement agencies Word has it theyre standard in
every FBI office for example  Something like several hundred
thousand of these phones exist in all They are clearly the US government
standard

So why does the DoJ need to buy new phones that unlike STUIIIs will
not be certified for classified traffic and in all likelihood will
not be compatible with existing STUIIIs

Unless of course theyre gearing up for large scale decryption of
civilian Clipper users and they need compatible hardware
