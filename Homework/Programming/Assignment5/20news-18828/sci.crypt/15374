Summary elided
The system as described here cant possibly work What happens when
someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M
the receiving chip needs KP to get KP the receiving chip needs UC
The only information it can work with is C If UC can be computed
from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key
escrow is bullshit Otherwise how is a message decrypted

The description of the chips operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects  Either the KP is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation or it is the
result of a DiffieHellman key exchange or something similar  Either
way there must be some protocols beyond those described here  It isnt
clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must
be provided by other system components
