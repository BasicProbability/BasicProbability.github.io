 Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says There is
 a global key G plus one key UC for each chip C The user can choose a
 new session key KP for each phone call P he makes Chip C knows three
 keys G its own UC and the users KP The government as a whole
 knows G and every UC Apparently a message M is encrypted as
 EGEUCKPC  EKPM Thats it
 
 The system as described here cant possibly work What happens when
 someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip To get M
 the receiving chip needs KP to get KP the receiving chip needs UC
 The only information it can work with is C If UC can be computed
 from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the key
 escrow is bullshit Otherwise how is a message decrypted

Via KP of course  Nothing was said about where KP comes from  Its
the session key though and its chosen however you usually choose
session keys  exponential key exchange shared secret RSA etc
But however you choose it the chip will apparently emit the escrow
header when you do
