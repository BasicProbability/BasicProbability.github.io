quoting someone else here 
The cryptographic protocol though is another matter  I see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret and  as I hope Ive shown above  there
are a lot of ways to do things that arent quite as bad

It just occurred to me why the algorithm is secret  If it were
published one could then build physically identical clone versions
of the chip that would interoperate with official Clipper chips  But
the cloner wouldnt provide the keys to the escrow houses  Hmmn

								Yeah

	The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
design that the Feds say that NSA developed  Is there a patent  Is that
patent publicly available  My betting is that that too is classified

	If the algorithm were made public or reverseengineered it would
compromise not only the goal of Justice of being able to read every chip
users cyptodata but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker

	Wouldnt that just be too bad
