   Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the US
government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative
For example how about a scheme using RSA and some hybrid of DESCFB and
another strong stream cipher Maybe IDEACFB  This could be substantially
the same as the cripple chip except that instead of keyregistration the
police could demand that you give up your secret key to them with a court
issued warrant  Then they could read the last few months of wiretapped
messages youve sent and assuming youve committed no crimes you could
generate a new key pair and go about your business  I find that Id be
willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system especially given the
alternative  If you were unwilling to give up your secret key then youd
probably stay in jail has anyone got a real legal precedent for this
   This would allow courtissued warrants to be used to gather information
on suspected criminals but it couldnt be done in secrecy and there
would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys
Maybe someone from the lawenforcement or intelligent community will correct
me but this doesnt seem like such a big loss in terms of lawenforcement
capabilities
 
   Any comments
