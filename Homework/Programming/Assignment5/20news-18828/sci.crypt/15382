 Nothing was said about where KP comes from

Oh Hellman said each user will get to choose his or her own key
Thats the key which I called KP the session key According to
Hellman if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip
then Alice chooses her own key and Bob chooses his own key
This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are
talking they use a common KP chosen by classical or publickey
approaches

The protocolkeymanagement description published so far is either
incomplete or incorrect It leaves me with no idea of how the system
would actually work I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that
we get full details
