Subject Re Fighting the Clipper Initiative

 As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist  Iat a loss for
 specific objections that dont sound frighteningly technical

  The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would
result in saying Sayonara to yet another hightech market isnt technical
isnt in the least difficult to understand and plays on a concern lots of
people are worried about already
