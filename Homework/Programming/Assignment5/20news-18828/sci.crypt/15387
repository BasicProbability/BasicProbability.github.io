 Lets assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
 you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent

 the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And Im not entirely joking about
 those two names
 
Hi Im new to Internet so this is a bit of a test message so even a 
token reply would be very appreciated

Anyways reading this Id figure this would be as excellent a method of 
corrupting the ACLU and the EFF as could be wished for  Who Gaurds the 
Guardians etc
