Subject Re Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip

    Indeed if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure its very likely
 as secure as IDEA or 2key DES  However the system as a whole isnt resistant
 to practical cryptanalysis  In The Puzzle Palace Bamford describes how
 several NSA employees were turned by foreign presumably KGB agents despite
 security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match  And
 NSA confidential data was not subject to being requested by thousands of
 police organizations and courts across the land

Ah yes dont anyone mention Ronald William Pelton heh heh heh  How
embarrassing
