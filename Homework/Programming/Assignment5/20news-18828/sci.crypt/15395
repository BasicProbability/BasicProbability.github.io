 Lets assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
 you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
 escrow houses  Lets say you even trust the escrow houses  one is
 the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And Im not entirely joking about
 those two names
 
 In that case the Prince of Wales has nothing to worry about on this
 system

I must respectfully disagree with this assertion Brad  The government is
notoriously sloppy with physical communications and information security  They
cant keep their computers safe and theyre trying  Read DEA is
Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information GAOIMTEC 9231 for an
excellent example of what Im talking about

Private sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures
I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign
intelligence services within months if not weeks of their selection  Private
organizations that lack the resources of a fullfleged intelligence service will
take longer  perhaps on the order of one to two years  Nonetheless the
penetrations will take place without question
