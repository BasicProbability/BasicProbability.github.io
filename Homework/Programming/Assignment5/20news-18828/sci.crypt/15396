Subject Re An Open Letter to Mr Clinton

strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

 Heres a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
 one Make it voluntary

As usually you are not reading The proposal does say that it is a
voluntary program This doesnt make it more desirable though

 That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
 to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

Secure How do you know Because NSA is trying to make you believe it
Trust us Yeah right

Otherwise you are on your own How do you know that tomorrow they
will not outlaw encrypring devices that dont use their technology
Because they are promising you Gee they are not doing even that 
read the proposal again

Vesselin
