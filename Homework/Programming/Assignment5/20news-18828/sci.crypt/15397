Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

 What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
 flames please 

It is incompetent like almost anything you have posted here so
youll be flamed sorry

 It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior
 corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies

 your 20 years of background in two Fortune 50 companies Ive
lived 30 years under a totalitarian regime and boy I can recognize
a totalitarian plot when I see one

 Id be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
 they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to

I am sure that you would be happy to use anything they tell you is
secure were talking about the intelligent people here Or the
criminal ones if you dont like the previous sentence  Or those
who dont want their privacy to be guaranteed to be invadable by the
government  any current and future government mind you

 Id be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
 the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
 satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment
and even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow
agencies NOW what guarantees that youll be happy with them TOMORROW
when the government changes Or when the current government throws
away the sheep skin All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get
caught by surprise but it will be too late because then cryptography
that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already
have been outlawed After all youve already got privacy that is
said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies so if you
are lawabiding you have no reasons to use a stronger one right So
if you are using a stronger one you have something to hide from the
law enforcement agencies right Something unlawful right Therefore
strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something
unlawful

 Id trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap

Considering the level of competence in cryptology that you have
demonstrated in your messages you would trust just anything And
no this is not an ad hominem attack its an attack against the
contents of your messages grin

 doorsId be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
 the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

And how do you know that these experts are not corrupted And how do
you know that they will not make a mistake And how do you know that
the version of the algorithm they will be let to examine is the same
as the one that will be really used

Regarding the mistake  even the few information they have let out
has revealed a serious security hole in the protocol  the 80bit key
is split in two 40bit ones thus the whole system is easily
breakable if you have only one of the keys

 Id trust something from the NSA long before Id trust something from some
 Swiss or anybody Japanese

The Swiss or the Japanese are motivated by simple greed NSA is
motivated by their wish to control the people Thats why the drug
dealers have their accounts in Swiss banks instead of in American
ones For some reason they do trust the Swiss banks more Guess
theyll trust the Swiss encryption more too I see IDEA becoming
suddenly popular 

 This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
 feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
 that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
 one very famous CEO put it to me one day

Its not surprising at all but not because of the reason you give
Its because it is obvious that the US government has put a lot of
money behind this program and it will support it Thus most
corporations will try to get their piece from the pie by supporting it
too The same good old greed Strong encryption is not widely
available now not because of some plot but because the companies
dont see much money in it It will be available even less if the
companies can see any penalties associated with it

 Just some perspective from another point of view

Yeah just as I predicted you are here again to support the new
system

Vesselin
