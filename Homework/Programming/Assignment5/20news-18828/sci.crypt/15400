 Nothing Im doing would be of the slightest interest to President Nixon 

A typical example of seepminded thinking We all know that David
Sternlight is a jerk but Im afraid that in this case 90 of the
population will think like him Realize it guys  NSA Dorothy
Denning and the US government have already won the battle

Unless unless you succeed to wake up the people but nah thats
too unlikely The events are happening too fast cryptography is a
too sophisticated issue and almost nobody cares anyway A few
thousand of netreaders wont make the difference if millions are
caught asleep Too sad
