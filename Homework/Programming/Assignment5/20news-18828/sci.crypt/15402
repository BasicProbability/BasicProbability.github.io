Subject Re WH proposal from Police point of view

strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

 dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the
 effects of the Clipper chip on state and local police Actually reading
 between the lines it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one
 respect since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and
 local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally

Instead of reading between the lines try to think a little bit OK
if thats way too difficult to you here are some hints

Indeed the new proposal imposes some additional burocratic burden on
the local police if they badly want to tape the magic cookie recipie
that your mom is telling you on the phone So guess what they will
do Propose that the new technology is removed Or implement some
facilitations Of course you wont want to wait until they get the
approval from two different agencies to decrypt the conversation
between two child molesters because meanwhile those two child
molesters might be conspiring about molesting your child right So
there should be some way for them to get access to those keys
quickly right Like they could have a copy of the database and
worry about a warrant later
