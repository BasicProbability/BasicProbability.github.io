Subject Re powerful similarity too

Ive been asked to supply more specific directions
for automated fetching of the source and documentation
for agrep the powerful similarity pattern matching tool

It is at

csarizonaedu
19212695

in directory

agrepREADME
agrepagrep204tarZ
agrepagrepps1Z
agrepagrepps2Z

The ps suffixed files are the optional postscript docs 
a reasonably good research report with benchmarks is
included

Note for Macintosh MPW users after a few hours of drudgery
I ported the tool to MPW 323 running under System 71
If you would like me to email a binhexed copy of the tool
suitable for dropping in to your MPWtools folder please write

Other than the more purely cryptographic uses for the tool
Ive been having lots of fun picking up the lost
references to things Im interested in For example
starting a search like

agrep 1 i Burning Chrome cyberpunkspool 

immediately finds references like burning crome that I
have always missed before  See how many times John
Gilmores name is mentioned in the CUD archives
and how often misspelled  How about your name

As usual I will email the uuencoded tarZ upon request
if you cannot do anonymous FTP
