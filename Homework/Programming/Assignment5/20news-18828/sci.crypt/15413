Subject Re Fifth Amendment and Passwords

I am postive someone will correct me if I am wrong but doesnt the Fifth
also cover not being forced to do actions that are selfincriminating

From Mike Godwin mnemonicefforg posted with permission  Carl

Sadly it does not Suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and
voice exemplars and to take blood and DNA tests

I am sure that Mike is correct on this point  I am also pretty sure that
administering truth serum would be ruled a violation of your right
not to incriminate yourself  But what is the salient difference
Both drawing blood and injecting truth serum incapacitate you for
a while but do no permanent damage  Is it simply that we have come to
view one as acceptable while the other is viewed as a fundamental
violation of ones rights  If this is the case how do we expand the
protections of the 5th amendment to incorporate new technologies without
the results being a hodgepodge of different judges personal opinions
