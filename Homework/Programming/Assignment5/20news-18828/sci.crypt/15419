	Let me ask you this  Would you trust Richard Nixon with your
crypto keys  I wouldnt

I take it you mean President Nixon not private citizen Nixon Sure
Nothing Im doing would be of the slightest interest to President Nixon 

	Are you sure you arent being watched  Let me remind you that 
Watergate was only the tip of the iceberg  Nixon extensively used the NSA
to watch people because he didnt like them  According to Decrypting the
Puzzle Palace

	Presumably the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance
	by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978FISA and a
	series of presidential directives beginning with one issued by
	President Ford following Richard Nixons bold misuse of the NSA in
	which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic
	surveillance of political dissidents and drug users

	Of course just because there are laws saying the govt is not 
supposed to conduct illegal surveillance doesnt mean those laws cant be
broken when they are in the way
