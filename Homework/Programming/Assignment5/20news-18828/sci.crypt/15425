Subject Re WH proposal from Police point of view


In article strnlghtC5puor704netcomcom strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

   There has been extensive discussion in the eff forum for example about
   inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to
   admissible evidence  This might put a stop to such things which must from
   time to time be simple fishing expeditions

Far more likely these things will continue to be done no matter what
assurances we are given Key Escrow is likely going to prove to be a
joke
