Subject Re More technical details

Hmm followup on my own posting Well who cares

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the
ClipperChip from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us

The chip itself is not confined to digital telephony but performs
general encryption in a symmetric manner  The chip supports CFB OFB
ECB and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is the algorithm
consists of 32 rounds of whatever and takes 80Bit keys Input data
seems to be 64 Bit Yes
So if two people want secure communication whatever that means when 
Clipper is involved they have first to agree on ONE secret key 
Or is it one key per direction 
They can exchange this key via DHschemes or however
Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipperchip
which is now ready to work
The clipper chip carries an unique SerialNumber 30 Bits and 160 KeyBits
These 160 keybits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serialnumber
with 160 seedbits The seedbits seem not to be stored in the chip
At beginning of communication and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin
before sending the fist real 64bit output of the first encryption the Clipper
chip puts out packets I guess 3 which represent the serial number
and the session key This might look like
X EK chipkeyK1K2 serial number
where X is a transformation of these 3 Packets involving a familykey
This familyspkey is equal for ALL chips X might be a simple XOR 
After that the digital phonecall can be done as usual every packet
being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper

Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated using a seed of 160
Bits

Now leaving alone politics which does not concern me as much as you not
being an American Citicientm     there are some weak points in this
scheme which might be exploited by several parties

As far as I know about the generation of K1K2  S1 and S2 look like the 
obvious backdoor They could be used to generate the chipkeys by knowing
the serialnumber and also the familykey of the chip I really cant
imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise as true randomsources
for the generation of the K1K2 can be bought for not to much money

Then the escrows Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160Bit key Security
could as little as existant be maximized by giving them 160bits
each which have to be xored together to give the K1K2 Now lets simply
assume the escrows are trustworthy and cant be fooled by criminals or
law enforchemnt agencies And there will be no quarrel between escrows
and lea which would hinder the lea in doing their duties and so on
and so on Once the keys are surrendered the corresponding
chip is compromised forever Not very clever IMHO   
How about sending in the encrypted sessionkeys for each phonecall that
the police or whoever wants to listen to Escrows could then simply decode
this sessionkey and send it back to police And would naturally not do this
after the warrant has expired This would be a better technical solution
but I guess politics will not work that way

Apparently as Miss Dennings stated the only one performing actually decodes
of intercepted messages shall be the FBI Great So local guys can not inter
cept understand your traffic anymore Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes
the right to do legal wiretaps  How is law over there I have no idea who
is allowed to tap and who not This certainly means that watched communi
cations will be routed automatically from the serviceproviding company
to the FBI if the communicaiton is a watched one And this means as far
as I understand it that the familykey has to be known by each switching
company and those providing cellularphone servies etcetc So the familykey
will not be very secret and thus serialnumbers of calls will be readable
by anybody who cares I like trafficanalysis

What do you guess what happens if you use the chip in ECB mode and the
first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled So the session
key would not be actually broadcasted over the line Hmmm Shouldnt be so
difficult to do that 

And now a last point for the other side After all I have read and heard about
Clipper not the programming language for dBase is it   it seems
to have many advantages which shold not be overseen


Now an afterthought to your rights Please note that I have no idea what I am
talking about

From gradynetcomcom 10162EF221
    Amendment 1                                                           
                                                                          
    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech
or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to 
petition the Government for a redress of grievances

If this text is actually in your Bill of Rights who can overrule this 
But Freedom of speech is not Secrecy of speech

Maybe you need to extend your Amendment 4  to cover information and
communication too 

I am not very sure in what position your government actually is legally
when it tries to ban cryptography and arms Amendment say you may have them
but not under what conditions Hmm tricky situation 

Actually it will make not much sense to discuss that topic in scicrypt
Discussion of technical details and vulnerabilites of the system are highly
suggested and appreciated 

Friendly greetings
