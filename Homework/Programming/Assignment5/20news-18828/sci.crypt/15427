shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture

Talk about adding insult to injury  
 
I for one believe that the use of civil forfeiture should be abolished by
a decent administration not continued  Instead it looks like that
illgotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment

I wholeheartedly agree  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies
seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that
we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELFGOVERNANCE  WE have
to take our government back from the selfserving politicians who create laws
and rules only to better their positions within the government  WE have allowed
them to take too much power from the people of this nation  That situation has
to be changed

Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to payoff drug
informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
with the Devil himself  Its a vicious cycle  The law enforcement agencies are
motivated to seize property to fund their own activities  And having no easy
way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
incentive for the agencies to take property

Its also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that
Clinton would have the plumbers out in force shortly  Clinton and his
henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control  Anytime a
leader believes in that the leader will use every means possible to retain that
control and take more

WE have to take OUR government back  Otherwise we will end up living in the
equivalent of a hightech third world dictatorship  We have to take
responsibility for ourselves our personal welfare and our actions
