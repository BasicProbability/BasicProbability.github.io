Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

   For example I dont own a cordless phone  With Clipper I would  If the 
   local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order 
   pizza Im no worse off than I am now and I dont have to worry about
   local kids or nosy neighbors
I do tend to agree  Sigh

   So where can I buy a DESencrypted cellular phone  How much does it cost

Of course if we didnt have government monopolies on cellular phone service
there probably would be some available

    How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of 
    providing law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making 
    the clipper system the only crypto available in the US 
   The Second and Fourth Amendments do come to mind  

The Second Amendment is especially apt given the ITAR definitions of
crypto equipment as munitions and the guncontrol peoples increasing
ability to define things as assault weapons and make them illegal
TripleDES is obviously used for assault phones while
Cripple will be legal and TripleCripple may fall into the gray area
of illegally upgrading to an assault phone
