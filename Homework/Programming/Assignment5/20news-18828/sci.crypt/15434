I wish I could agree with you  Ask yourself this  Why would any private
sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least
partially compromised Key escrows in this instance  Why would any
private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly
evaluated  ie algorythm not publically released
The answer seems obvious to me they wouldnt  There is other hardware out
there not compromised  DES as an example triple DES as a better one

What follows is my opinion It is not asserted to be the truth so no
flames please  It comes out of a background of 20 years as a senior
corporate staff executive in two Fortune 50 companies

No wonder American businesses are going down the tubes 

Id be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

Its NIST not NSA  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this
They didnt say that  They said is was better than some commercialgrade
encryptions  I for one wouldnt trust them if they did unless they
release the algorithm for investigation

Id be happy to do so even with escrowed keys provided I was happy about
the bona fides of the escrow agencies the Federal Reserve would certainly
satisfy me as would something set up by one of the big 8 accounting firms

Maybe the ACLU and EFF  It would have to be a nonprofit so the big 8
would be out

Id trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsId be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

I wouldnt trust the NSA  I think I would trust the President on this but
Im not certain he would be told

Id trust something from the NSA long before Id trust something from some
Swiss or anybody Japanese

Thats your problem

This may seem surprising to some here but I suggest most corporations would
feel the same way Mostmanysome pick one corporations have an attitude
that the NSA is part of our government and we support our government as
one very famous CEO put it to me one day

I want to emphasize the I am not speaking for Beckman Instruments at this
point  However we are an international company and I would like to think
that our customers come first ahead of our governments whims
