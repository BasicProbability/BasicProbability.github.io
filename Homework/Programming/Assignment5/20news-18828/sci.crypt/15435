 fishing expeditions without the targets knowlege  Dont give up the
 right to be safe from that  that should be nonnegotiable and Clinton
 and Co know it which is probably why they quietly developed this thing
 figuring if they get it this far they can ram it on through

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever
administration is current for things they couldnt possibly have
initiated  This chip had to take years to develop yet already
were claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us
Bullshit  The Bush administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli  That doesnt excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it but lets lay
the body at the proper door to start with
