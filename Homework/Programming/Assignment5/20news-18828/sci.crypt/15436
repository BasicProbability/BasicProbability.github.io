Subject Screw the people crypto is for hardcore hackers  spooks only

Since the wiretap chip is being distributed internationally
allowing the US government to spy on foreign governments
companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic citizens
this is a worldwide issue  Please put DISTRIBUTION WORLD on the 
Distrubution line  Thank you

However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please who
cares about the clipper chip 

You dont care that people are being lied to fooled into believing
the chip gives privacy when it fact it allows wiretaps  You
dont give a shit about anybodys privacy except your own  And
not even your own are you so smart that you know when youre talking to
somebody who has a wiretap chip on their phone instead of a privacy
chip with private keys

attitude that everyone else should have Instead of worrying about a
clipper chip simply connect your handset to your computer and feed
the voice single through process encrypt and transmit over the
phone The guy on the other hand then does the same in reverse

Simply Everyone should have this attitude   The only people
who can have this attitude are the most hardcore
computer hackers who never make phone calls away from their
computer who apparently never call anybody except another computer 
hacker or perhaps another spook US classified agents refuse to use
their own system only oblivious civilian dupes get that dubious privilege
Only spooks and hardcore hackers need privacy huh

We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but
were talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized
cellulars that need strong crypto real privacy  Makeshift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesnt 
do anything for anybodys privacy in the real world  

What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime 
voiceencryption RSA put it into a silicon compiler and spit out ASIC  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business diplomats and private communications  If the US bans 
it we make it somewhere else and import it  The Japanese German
Dutch Taiwanese Korean etc electronics companies dont want the 
NSA spying on them  US workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity
