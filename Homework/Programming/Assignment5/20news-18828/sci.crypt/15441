	The following is available in some FTP archive somewhere I insert
my comments liberally throughout this demonic memo of Big Brotherdom

	White House Announcement on Screw Thread Standards
	

	This is to announce that the American National Standards
Institute or whatever it is has been given the authority to define
standard dimensions for screw threads

   Look This is clearly the first step toward outlawing our
   own screw thread specifications If this madness isnt fought
   tooth and nail every step of the way itll be a crime to use
   screw threads other than those our Fearless Leaders so graciously
   define for us

Sarcastic text deleted No value judgement implied

	Screw you Bill Clinton You and your totalitarianist thugs

At first I was going to complain that your analogy was completely
irrelevant  But then I remembered something

Remember that move to get the US to the metric system all those
years ago  As far as I know we were supposed to be there by now

The government sold it as better for the people easier to be in
tune with the rest of the world  They had decided it was for
our own good

Then when the plan was released it soon became apparant that the
government were a bunch o thickies

Think about it change all the railroad track widths signs
screws abolish the old regime

At the cost of millions of dollars

Your point is well taken  You think there is nothing to worry
about you could care less who designs your cryptography any
more than who designs your screws or the system of measurement
you use

Sit back thats right just relax well take care of all your
needs Mr Molitor
