     Oh great Wonderful news Nobody can listen inexcept the feds 
 
    Hey its better than the status quo
 
    I am far less worried about the feds tapping my phone than high school 
    scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
    cordless phone calls
 
 Im a political dissident Im scared shitless of the feds listening
 in on my calls My opinions are the sort that would get me
 disappeared in a slightly less free society  and who knows what
 sort of society we will be in in five or ten years I have friends who
 have had their phones tapped  none of this is theoretical to me
 
 As for its better than the status quo well first of all you can
 get a cryptophone from companies like Cylink today  and they work
 well In addition a number of groups are now working on building
 software to turn any PC into a privacy enhanced phone right now  and
 they are all working in overdrive mode
 
    And yes Id rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted but this is at 
    least an incrememental improvement for certain applications
 
 There ARE no crypto restrictions yet You can use anything you want
 RIGHT NOW The point is to maintain that right

The point you all seem to have missed was covered when the UK cellphone
scrambling system was discussed  Incidentally my MP has responded to
my questions on that issue and it appears that the UK and other approved
countries will get the secure A5 encryption and dodgy countries will
get A5X  Existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
A5X systems but newer equipment will use A5A5Xclear depending on the
capabilities of the base station

The copsfeds do not need to be able to get hold of your private key to
listen in to cellular conversations  Encryption is not endtoend but 
cellphone to basestation  it has to be this way so that cellular users
and fixed installations can talk to each other  For cellular to cellular
calls the transmission is decrypted at the basestation passed to another
basestation and reencrypted  The copsfeds can listen to the unscrambled
call provided they get a warrant to tap into the cellular providers
equipment  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
listen without having to obtain a warrant

But maybe the Clipper system is secure and they really do need a warrant
to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner see
above  they dont have to go down this route anyway  I have my doubts
but even if true once they have the key they will never again need a
warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want  Well Judge
it appears he wasnt a drugdealer after all so naturally well stop
listening in

You have every reason to be scared shitless  Take a look at the records
of McCarthy Hoover J Edgar not the cleaner  though they both excelled at
sucking and Nixon
