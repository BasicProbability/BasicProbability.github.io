From rabwellsfcaus Bob Bickford
Subject Re More technical details


Another objection occurred to me  There was a comment about how
supposedly there would only be one decode box operated by the FBI
This is flat ridiculous and I dont believe it for a millisecond
Even if they in fact only build one or two or some other small
number of these that wont stop others from building one  Make
it work like two Clipperchip phones one listening to each side
of the recorded conversation  Ill have to have another look at
the specs posted so far but offhand I didnt see anything that
would preclude this sort of thing
