Subject Cripple Chip

How about this  The
TelCo has your Clipper key  The TelCo
has your intended partners key if he is
using one  Whenever you call the message
gets decrypted and reencrypted wihtout
y key exchange  I know its a stupid
system but for the feds itd be
great  The point of this isnt to
take over the crypto market BTW  Clinton
doen not want people to have any sort of crypto at
all just like Busch  But he needs some support
for the technology initiative garbage hes
pushing industrial policy stuff and a computer
hip designed by the govt is just the thing

Whos going to thing about the literal Billions of
Dollars it took for a government agency to design
