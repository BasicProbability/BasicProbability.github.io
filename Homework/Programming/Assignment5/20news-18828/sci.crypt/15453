Subject Re Why the clipper algorithm is secret

In article C5pstrLu2panixcom dflpanixcom Danny OBedlam writes
	The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
design that the Feds say that NSA developed  Is there a patent  Is that
patent publicly available  My betting is that that too is classified

Unless there has been a major change in the law theres no such beast
as a classified patent  Patents exist to encourage communications and
develop the state of the art 

The 17year lock is a nuisance but historically has been pretty trivial
Its only in an industry which doubles performance every three years or
18 months for some hardware that 17 years is an eternity

The same thing applies in civilian development you cant patent something 
and declare it a trade secret  However you can and should mark all
software including proprietary code unpublished copyright so that it
ever does get exposed you still have some legal protection

PostBerne this isnt required since everything is born copyrighted
But it takes a while for people to learn the new rules
