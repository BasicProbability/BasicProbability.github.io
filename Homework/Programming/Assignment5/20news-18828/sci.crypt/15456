I would think that you could reduce the defense of using nonclipper
based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression 
IE free speech  That you have to right to express whatever you
want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do
not impinge on the rights of others

Encrypted textsoundvideo is just another form of expression of that
particular textsoundvideo  Just like digitized sound is another 
means of expression of sound  streams of 100100101111 instead of
continuous waveforms

Also it shouldnt be up to the government at all  Encryption 
Standards can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations
apologies for the acronym  One can note how well this has worked
with ISO and the Metric System SAE etc  Independent entities 
or consortia of peopleindustries in that particular area are far
more qualified to set standards than any One government agency
Consider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked
like if it was decided by the government

I hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses  Im still working
on mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon
