Subject Would clipper make a good cover for other encryption method

Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of
encryption

Currently when you send an encrypted message an opponent can usually
tell 1 that you are using encryption 2 which encryption method you
are using because that information is usually in the clear

With clipper most opponents will only know that you are sending
clippertext they wont know that your clippertext is itself
encoded

Only those few opponents who get your clipperkeys will know
that your message is double encrypted

 kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box

So dont just think of replacements for clipper also think of front
ends
