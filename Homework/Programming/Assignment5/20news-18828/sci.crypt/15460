	encrypted under K then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK 
	and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
	message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
	producing

	     E EM K EK UK serial number  SK

My understanding is that EM K is not encrypted under SK called the
family key and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
law enforcement  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this  I
will also check it out but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait

Ok so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the
chip the real message encrypted with the conventional key and the
serial number and encrypted conventional key encrypted with the
IMHO kind of bogus as the whole concept of one key that millions of
people use which cant be changed doesnt seem reasonable family
key

Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and Im able to determine
which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number
and session key  Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on
this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session
key and twiddles a bit or several before its sent down the line

Mind you Im sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other
attacks I cant imagine and the system is probably somehow designed
so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant
receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully  But how
What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent
bittwiddling scheme so the decryption chip sees the restored
proper bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a EK UK packet thats
wrong

I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip sends that
information out many times in slightly different ways making it
effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information
being sent
