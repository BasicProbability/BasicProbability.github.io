  As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist  Iat a loss for
  specific objections that dont sound frighteningly technical

 result in saying Sayonara to yet another hightech market isnt technical
 isnt in the least difficult to understand and plays on a concern lots of
 people are worried about already
 


Could you expand on this I have a feeling youre right but I dont quite
understand
