 	Not to pick on Mr May in particular of course but isnt this
 kind of the domino theory When one little country falls its neighbor
 will surely follow and before you know it were all mining salt
 in Siberia for not turning in our Captain Crunch Secret Decoder Rings
 
 But for all the wrongness of our attempt to correct it VietNam et al
 the domino theory wasnt disproved at all

Ironically the domino theory in fact was a reasonable metaphor for
the collapse of communism from the liberalizations in Poland and
Hungary to the border crossings in the summer of 89 to the fall of
the Wall later that yearand then to the ultimate collapse of the
USSR
