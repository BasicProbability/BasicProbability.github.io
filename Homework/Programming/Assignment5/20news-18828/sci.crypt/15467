A few more sources are statistics on your filesystems easily
and quickly obtained and the output from the rusage system
call  

You can also exec a finger to one or more favorite heavilyused
systems though this can take several seconds

cf the source code to RIPEM on ripemmsuedu

Other alternatives include output of vmstat iostat pstat and friends
with various flags or even better crash 

eg on an RS6000 AIX 32 you can get lots of relatively
unpredicatble data out of crash the output from the following script 
usually gives about 600k of goo on a moderately busy system

binsh
crash 
proc 
tty
stack
pcb
callout
vfs 
socket
vnode
inode 
mbuf
file
mst
