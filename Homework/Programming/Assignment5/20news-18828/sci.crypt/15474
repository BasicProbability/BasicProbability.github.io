 Here is a disturbing thought
good stuff elided
 Dont pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on
 the escrow databases
 

 secret The escrow databases arent the sorts of secrets that our
 teachers told us about but they are the sort of big secrets they
 would lump into this category Imagine trying to replace 100 million
 Clipper chips

Sounds to me like a great gimmick for a replacement marketevery
so often issue a Clipper Alert announcing that some key backup tapes
are missing that some Drug Lords got em whatever Then the owners
of these 1200 Clipperphones have to trot down to their local Key
Escrow Agency and buy new chips and have them programmed

Microtoxin the Clipper supplier will make a killingmaybe this was
the real idea Anybody know if Janet Reno has stock in Microtoxin
VLSI Technology or ATT

Could be a good opportunity to undermine this with some
disinformation float rumors that the key database has been stolen
All the chips need replacing It angers people undermines confidence
even more and kills sales

After the Waco Massacre and the Big Brother Wiretap Chip any tactic
is fair
