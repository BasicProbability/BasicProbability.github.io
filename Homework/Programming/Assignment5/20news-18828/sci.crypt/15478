Subject Re Secret algorithm Re Clipper Chip and crypto keyescrow

 The copsfeds do not need to be able to get hold of your private key to
 listen in to cellular conversations  Encryption is not endtoend but 
 cellphone to basestation  it has to be this way so that cellular users
 and fixed installations can talk to each other  For cellular to cellular
 calls the transmission is decrypted at the basestation passed to another
 basestation and reencrypted  The copsfeds can listen to the unscrambled
 call provided they get a warrant to tap into the cellular providers
 equipment  The only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
 listen without having to obtain a warrant

 But maybe the Clipper system is secure and they really do need a warrant
 to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner see
 above  they dont have to go down this route anyway  I have my doubts
 but even if true once they have the key they will never again need a
 warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want  Well Judge
 it appears he wasnt a drugdealer after all so naturally well stop
 listening in

That was true for the UK Paul but Im fairly sure theyre talking about
building endtoend encryption phones out of this chip  Its not for
cellular though it certainly could be used there in the way you suggest
