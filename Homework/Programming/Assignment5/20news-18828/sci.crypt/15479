Subject Screw the people crypto is for hardcore hackers  spooks only 

Since the ATT wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed 
internationally allowing the US government to spy on foreign 
governments companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic 
citizens this is a worldwide issue  Thus Distribution world

However assuming that I can still encrypt things as I please who
cares about the clipper chip 

Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip  Do we give a shit
about anybodys privacy accept our own  And perhaps not even our
own are we so smart that we always know when were talking to
somebody who has a wiretap on their phone

I find the call thru your computer ideas may reflect this attitude
Ideas that are of by and for hackers and dont help anybody in the
real world arent going to do anybody much good including ourselves
where voice phones are concerned

We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but
were talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized
cellulars that need strong crypto real privacy  Makeshift
computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesnt 
do anything for anybodys privacy in the real world  

What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime 
voiceencryption RSA silicon compile it and spit out ASIC  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business diplomats and private communications  If the US bans 
it we make it somewhere else and import it  The Japanese German
Dutch Taiwanese Korean etc electronics companies dont want the 
NSA spying on them  US workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity
