Subject Re Fighting the Clipper Initiative

  As a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist  Iat a loss for
  specific objections that dont sound frighteningly technical
 
   The idea that foisting the Cripple Chip standard on US manufacturers would
 result in saying Sayonara to yet another hightech market isnt technical
 isnt in the least difficult to understand and plays on a concern lots of
 people are worried about already     

  Could you expand on this


  Simple  if you have a choice between

 1 American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested
     algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy
     behavoir or

 2 Japanese to pick the obvious example manufacturers peddling encryption
     chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under
     the control of the user

which would you choose  At most the American government can deny this
choice to American citizens and probably not that if the glorious success
of the War on Drugs is any example it cant do much about the global market
