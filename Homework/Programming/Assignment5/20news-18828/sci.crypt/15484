But who would
trust hisher confidential information to an encryption scheme that for
say 100000 could by cracked one time in a hundred  DES for all the
complaints about a 56bit key would probably cost several million dollars
to build a keysearch machine for
 

I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx 500K but
it is not sold by that name Go buy a circuit emulation machine eg Quickturn
containing a bunch of FPGAs say 500 to 1000 3090s and program each
to be a DES search engine Lets say 500 chips running at 10Mhz  5G testssec
Time is 14e6 sec max  23 weeks 12 weeks average Cant wait that long
Buy a bigger machine

Oh but can Big Brother afford such things in these times of tight
budgets

I dont know how many folks noticed it but Dorothy Trust Me Denning gave
a real clue to the current state of the art at NSA on decrypto machines when
she said the NSA told her they didnt even want to be the holder of any
part of the key  

Now why is that  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack  But we will
never know  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they
couldnt compromise  Ergo NSA is now capable of compromising probably
with brute force keysearch engines of the complexity of Skipjack  Look
at the specs  Why I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging
away in their crypto busters Maybe even tens of thousands  Complexity
Not much more than a 3090  How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade

I think PGP23 should have 256 bit IDEA keys
