Id be happy to use a crypto system supplied by the NSA for business if
they told me it was more secure than DES and in particular resistant to
attempts by Japanese French and other competitive companies and
governments to break

Its NIST not NSA  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this

With all the activity in scicrypt these past few days I am not supprised
you missed it NIST got Skipjack from the NSA 


Id trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap
doorsId be even happier if a committee of independent experts examined
the thing under seal of secrecy and reported back that it was secure

I wouldnt trust the NSA  I think I would trust the President on this but
Im not certain he would be told

I am not a crook President Richard M Nixon
