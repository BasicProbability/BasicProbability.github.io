Subject Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption

	From bradclarinetcom Brad Templeton

	Lets assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
	you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
	escrow houses  Lets say you even trust the escrow houses  one is
	the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And Im not entirely joking about
	those two names

Im really not entirely sure I trust EFF any more to be honest

Anyway any organisation can be deeply infiltrated  Look at CND in Britain
a dozen years ago  one of their top members was an SIS spy who stole their
complete address list  How hard would it be to get one person to sneak in
and copy the escrow data to disk
