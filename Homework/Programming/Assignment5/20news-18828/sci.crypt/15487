They dont have to track customer lists  they merely have to digitally
listen to any phone line and eliminate any that dont have the clipper
headersignature  Noone has said how it will be modulated  want a bet
its a nonstandard and hence easily recognisable baudrate

Devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist  Ive seen
them advertised in the trade press

Once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems whats
left is crypto worth looking more closely at  I guess any substitute scheme
will have to be v32bis or vfast to disguise it though then they just start
looking at the data too

Whatever happens though the effect of this new chip will be to make private
crypto stand out like a sore thumb
