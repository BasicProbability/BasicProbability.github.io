Subject Re Secret algorithm Re Clipper Chip and crypto keyescrow

 Can you while my mind is on it give us one good reason that the
 algorithm should be a secret algorithm unless this encryption scheme
 either is a joke or contains features like a master key or other back
 door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping

Hmm here are a couple

1 If the algorithm becomes known it will be easy to produce
pincompatible noncrippled chips that provide real encryption and
privacy because their keys are only in their users hands

2 Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher it needs some way to
agree on a session key The released information says that any
protocol may be used eg DH From a theoretical point of view
this is probably true However from a practical point of view those
chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol builtin What if
it is good old RSA This will mean that the producer will have to pay
lots of bucks to PKP By keeping the details secret this can be
avoided
