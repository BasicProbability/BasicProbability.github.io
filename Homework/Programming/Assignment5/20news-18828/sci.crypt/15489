      Just a question 
      As a provider of a public BBS service  arent you bound by law to gurantee
      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS if police comes
      with sufficent authorisation  I guessed this would be  a basic condition
      for such systems I did run a bbs some time ago but that was in Switzerland

The US doesnt yet have many laws covering BBSs  theyre not common carriers
theyre not phone companies theyre just private machines or services
operated by businesses  Theres no obligation to keep records
As Perry Metzger points out if the police come with a search warrant
you have to let them see what the warrant demands if it exists
and they generally can confiscate the equipment as evidence
which is not Constitutionally valid but were only beginning to
develop court cases supporting us  A court MAY be able to compel
you to tell them information you know such as the encryption password
for the disk  there arent any definitive cases yet since its a new
situation and there probably arent laws specifically covering it
But the court cant force you to know the keys and there are no
laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys
for their own files without giving them to you

Even in areas that do have established law there is uncertainty
There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records
subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other businessrestriction law
so he gave the court the records  Which were in Hebrew
The US doesnt have laws forcing you to keep your records in English
and these were the originals of the records  HE didnt speak Hebrew
and neither did anybody in the court organization  Dont think they
were able to do much about it

It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers
based on race religion national origin gender or sexual preference
it probably hasnt been tested in court but it seems like a plausible
extension of antidiscrimination laws affecting other businesses



				Pray for peace      Bill
