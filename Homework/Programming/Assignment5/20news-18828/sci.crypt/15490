Subject new reason for Clipper algm secrecy

Apologies for not posting to altclipper or whatever but it seems it
may not be in the newsfeed here

There may be another reason good from NSAs point of view horrible
from everyone elses why the algorithmchip design might be secret

First note that the experts will only look at details and of just 
the algorithm

    In addition respected experts from outside the
    government will be offered access to the confidential details of
    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
    their findings

Why not the chip design  Well heres the possiblity  in addition to
encryption the chip preprocesses voice signals to make them easier
to analyzetranscribe electronically  The chip once widespread might
effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for voice
grepping the US phone network or the criminal  wrongthinking patrons
thereof

I wouldnt put it past the NSA  Think how much easier it would make life
for them

And if this is indeed the case think of the possible public outcry should
it become widely known  Thus the secrecy

It might be a good idea to have experts in DSP voice recognition and
AI conversationunderstanding to be on that panel and insist they be
given authenticatable design specs and implementation documentation
