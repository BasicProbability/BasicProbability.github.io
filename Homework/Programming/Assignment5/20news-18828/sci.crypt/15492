        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 
The algorithm operates on 64bit blocks like DES and the chip supports
all 4 DES modes of operation  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling
compared with 16 in DES

 So in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the USA all
networked together Sounds like a good science fiction story  the government
wants to crack foreign DES or whatever messages so they con the public into
individually buying all of the components and installing them Soon the US
could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world built on top of
our current phone net

 Those who suppress freedom always                             Rob Quinn 
 do so in the name of law                                rjqphysksuedu
