Subject List of large integer arithmetic packages

This is the file BIGNUMSTXT from ripemmsuedu last updated April 1993

In response to Email requests I have assembled this list of
largeinteger arithmetic packages of which I have heard
Most of these are C function libraries available in source form

For your convenience I have placed copies of
some of these on ripemmsuedu 3581178  They are
available for anonymous FTP in the directory pubbignum
However what I have may not be the most current version in all cases

Here they are in no particular order

mp
    Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes
    
    Multiple precision package accessed via lmp flag on your
    compiler  Provides     gcd exponentiation
    sqrt  Comes with SunOS NeXT Mach BBN Mach 1000 
    and probably a few others  See man mp  
    Object code only of course

PARI
    Henri Cohen et al Universite Bordeaux I Paris FRANCE
    
    Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines
    Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020 
    semioptimized code for SPARC and apparently rather slow
    generic C version  Does both integers and reals
    Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars
    Contains a number of advanced functions some of which Ive
    never heard of  Webers function
    Has a factorization function primality test  other related stuff
    Plenty of TEX documentation
    Public domain but you cant distribute modified versions
    Available via anonymous FTP from mathuclaedu  There seem to
    be Mac and NeXTspecific versions there in addition to
    Filename  pari135atarZ
    
Arithmetic in Global Fields  Arith
    Kevin R Coombes David R Grant
    
    Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or
    polynomials over finite fields  Includes basic    
    and a few others like gcd  Source code in C
    Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license
    Includes man pages and TEX documentation
    Filename  arithtarZ

Arbitrary Precision Math Library
    Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos CA
    
    C package which supports basic      Provides for radix
    points ie nonintegers  Not as polished as the others here
    Posted to compsourcesmisc in October 1988
    Filename  apmltarZ
    
BigNum
    J Vuillemin INRIA FRANCE and others
    Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab DECPRL
    
    A portable and efficient arbitraryprecision integer package
    C code with generic C kernel plus assembly kernels for
    MC680x0 Intel i960 MIPS NS32032 Pyramid and of course VAX
    This is probably one of the betterknown packages of this type
    Implements     mod plus logical operations OR AND XOR
    Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available
    Available via email from librariandecprldeccom
    You will receive 5 shell archives  Give your postal address
    and you will also receive printed documentation from France
    Package includes TEX documentation
    Publicly available for noncommercial use
    I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL
    doesnt like others to distribute it  However BIGNUM is
    distributed as part of ecpp see below

Lenstras package
    Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore
    
    Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C
    Includes     exponentiation mod primality testing
    sqrt random number generator and a few others  The package
    was uncommented and undocumented I have tried to add enough
    comments to get by  This is the only of these packages that I
    have actually used  It works well and is very portable  
    I havent done any benchmarks against the others but the code 
    looks clever  Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist
    Unlike the other packages here this one requires you to allocate
    storage staticallyonly a problem if your numbers are really huge
    Arjen has placed the code in the public domain  
    Filename  lenstratarZ

lenstra31
    Arjen Lenstra  Bellcore

    An improved version of Arjens package above  This one
    does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation which can be turned
    off as an option Has a few new routines too  lenstra31 contains
    minor bugfixes to the previouslyavailable lenstra2 and lenstra3
    Filename  lenstra31c

bmp  Brents Multiple Precision
    R P Brent

    1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating 
    fixed point arithmetic  Includes most of the mathematical
    functions youd find in a FORTRAN runtime library
    This code is an ACM algorithm number 524
    To obtain send a mail message to  netlibornlgov
    containing the line send mpf from bmp or better yet perhaps
    just start with help

SPX
    Kannan Alagappan  Joseph Tardo DEC
    
    This is a huge prototype public key authentication system
    based on RSA  I mention it here because those who have heard
    of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large
    integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer
    package it contains is indeed DECs BigNum from France
    You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crldeccom 192582062 
    Use it only for testing as it may expire on a certain date
    I dont know whether this has expired yet

amp  Anttis Multiple Precision
    Antti Louko   alokampihutfi

    Multiple precision integer package in C  Includes     
    pow mod 1x mod y random sqrt gcd  Available for noncommercial
    use  The package includes sharesecret a public key system based
    on the DiffieHellman algorithm
    This is normally part of the wellknown desdisttarZ
    but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with 
    cryptographic export laws and have named the result
    Filename  amptarZ

    fast arithmetic  Has a version optimized for 386 machines  Includes
    routines to do MPQS the fastest currently known general factoring
    algorithm  An additional file is at both sites to allow MPQS to use
    hard drives so that it can factor up to 80 digits  Many number
    theoretical functions are included in UBASIC  It allows over 2500
    digits of precision

Bells Arbitrary Precision Calculator
    David I Bell Australia  dbellpdactpdnecisaozau

    Arbitraryprecision calculator with good online help Clike
    language many builtin functions support for integers

    gcd primality testing even trig functions  Recommended
    Large package though  Obtained from compsourcesunix
    Filename calc1247tarZ

Builtin support in other languages
    Various

    Multiple precision arithmetic is available in a number of 
    programming languages such as Lisp and ABC cf mcsuneunet
    Perl by Larry Wall available from devvaxjplnasagov
    includes source in Perl for such a package but its probably
    not suitable for serious use
    For some of these source code may be available  This list is
    long enough so Im not going to pursue it aggressively

Thanks to Ed Vielmetti and several others who contributed to this list
