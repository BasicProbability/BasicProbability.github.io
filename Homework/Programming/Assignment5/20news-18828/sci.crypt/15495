	   Each chip includes the following components

	      the Skipjack encryption algorithm
	      F an 80bit family key that is common to all chips
	      N a 30bit serial number
	      U an 80bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

	Hmmm A thirty bit serial number And we are told the unit key U is
	derived deterministically from this serial number That means that
	there are only one billion possible unit keys

Oh hell its much worse than that  You think theyll ever make
more than a million of them  Serial numbers arent handed out at random
you know they start at 1 and work up  Call it a 20 bit space maybe
