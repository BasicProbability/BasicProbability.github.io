That leads me to conjecture that

I seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would
place the onus on the individual to register keys  Realistically the
ClipperChip will probably emit an ID code which will serve as the identifier
when requesting the key fragments  The chip manufacturer would register
this identifier code vs key combination when the chip is made and the
uninitiated enduser can therefore remain completely outside the loop
The chip could be used in a cellular phone a modem or other device 
it really makes no difference  When the authorities detect the use of this
encryption standard during surveillance they would then capture the ID
and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data
