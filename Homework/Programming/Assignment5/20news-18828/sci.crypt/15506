Subject Re Is there ANY security in the Clipper

In article ZEEV93Apr18014822sepiacccamdahlcom zeevcccamdahlcom Zeev Wurman writes
It seems to me that all discussions about Clipper security are almost 
irrelevant  if I cannot choose the key but have to use a key chosen for
me by the foundry the security of the WHOLE UNIVERSE OF USERS is as good
or as bad as the security of VLSI Technologies Inc

 or their handlers

It is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains ALL THE KEYS EVER 
MANUFACTURED  after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that
will ever be manufactured The key depositories can be as secure and
incorruptible as they wish to be nobody cares anyway

They key depositories are IRRELEVANT In order for the applicable law
enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from
escrow the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text
as part of the link establishment protocol Whoever owns the program 
that assigns keys to each serial number wont need access to the key
depository

In other words the FBI may need a courtordered release of escrowed
keys but the NSA has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured
There is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys While
relations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained
there is also a long history of trading favors This will reestablish
the NSA as a very important agency for everyone to get along with
because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without court
orders

The more I think about this affair the fouler it smells Id rather
have a DES with an engineeredin backdoor
