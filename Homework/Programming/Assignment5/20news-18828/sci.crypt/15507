 You dont care that people are being lied to fooled into believing the 
 chip gives privacy when it fact it allows wiretaps

It does give privacy just not absolute privacy  The announcement was very 
up front about this and about allowing wiretaps  How is this fooling 
anyone

 are you so smart that you know when youre talking 
 to somebody who has a wiretap chip on their phone instead of a privacy 
 chip with private keys 

Sure  The two dont interoperate  You couldnt talk to say a Cylink phone 
from a Clipper phone  I would expect even multiprotocal phones to come with 
indicators saying which kind of link encryption is in use

 We do need an alternative to NSAbugged telephones but 
 were talking inexpensive telephones here including handsized 
 cellulars that need strong crypto real privacy

So start a company and build them  This is still mostly a capitalist 
economy

 What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime 
 voiceencryption RSA put it into a silicon compiler and spit out 
 ASIC  Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for 
 international business diplomats and private communications

I agree  Go for it
