Subject Clipper business as usual


    Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal how much
of a change is it  ATTs last product in this area a was priced over
1000 as I suspect clipper phones will be b came to the customer 
with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities Thus
aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the feds posture
Clipper seems to be more of the same rather than a new direction
   Yes technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote
more widespread use but at present the man on the street is not going
to purchase a 1000 crypto telephone especially when the guy on the other
end probably doesnt have one anyway  Am I missing something
   The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air
tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc  That
has got to a problematic scenario for them even if the extent of usage
never surpasses the underground stature of PGP
