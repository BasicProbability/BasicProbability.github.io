	With EMail if they cant break your PGP encryption theyll just
call up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic emmisions
from your computer or terminal  Note that measures to protect yourself from
TEMPEST surveillance are still classified as far as I know

Note that TEMPEST is the name of the shielding standard  TEMPEST is not
the name of the surveillance technique
