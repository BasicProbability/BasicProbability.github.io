 With EMail if they cant break your PGP encryption theyll just
 call up one of their TEMPEST trucks and read the electromagnetic 
 emmisions from your computer or terminal  Note that measures to 
 protect yourself from TEMPEST surveillance are still classified as 
 far as I know

 are LCD displays vulnerable to tempest

I can see highvoltage type display devices being vulnerable CRTs
plasma displays etc  But Jason beat me to this question  What
about EM radiation from lowvoltage items like LCD displays

Perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry  The cabling
What about a portable PCMacetc where all the noise is bunched
into one tiny area
