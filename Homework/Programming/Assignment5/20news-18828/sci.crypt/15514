 Now why is that  I doubt there is a trapdoor in Skipjack  But we will
 never know  And I doubt the NSA would promote a mass market chip they
 couldnt compromise  Ergo NSA is now capable of compromising probably
 with brute force keysearch engines of the complexity of Skipjack  Look
 at the specs  Why I bet they have thousands of little chips chugging
 away in their crypto busters Maybe even tens of thousands  Complexity
 Not much more than a 3090  How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade

 I think PGP23 should have 256 bit IDEA keys

Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
has 280 possible keys  Lets assume a bruteforce engine like that
hypothesized for DES  1 microsecond per trial 1 million chips  Thats
1012 trials per second or about 38000 years for 280 trials  Well
maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build
a machine with 10 million chips  Sure  only 38 years for each solution

IDEA uses 128bit keys  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you
Hint  multiply 38 years by 212880  And you cant do IDEA at that
speed key setup takes much too long  I wouldnt be surprised if that
were the case for Skipjack too though theres no way of knowing just
yet  DES used only xor because thats what was feasible with mid70s
technology  Modern chips can do a lot more

NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA I doubt it for
the former I have no idea for the latter though it does seem to be a
strong cryptosystem  But it aint gonna be by exhaustive search
