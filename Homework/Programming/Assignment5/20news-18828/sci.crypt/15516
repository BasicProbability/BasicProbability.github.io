Subject Re Clipper considered harmful

bradoptilinkCOM Brad Yearwood writes

 Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications specificall
 the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats
 will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user and
 to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the
 device will be delayed

Why doing it in such a rough manner It is much more professional to
steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
pincompatible donothing chip that does not encrypt at all Chances
are that the victim will not notice anything especially if it is done
professionally

 Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen criminals can communicate
 with impunity assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from
 key escrow until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means

No because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations
True theyll blame the wrong guys but nevertheless one cannot say
something like The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship Terminus
when the Feds are listening even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is

No the criminals will just use some secure encryption The new
proposal does not stop criminals it ensures that the government will
be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper
To me it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
strong encryption devices
