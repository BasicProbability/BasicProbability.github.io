  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread

The chip and algorithm are classified  If you reverse engineer it and
tell people you are likely to go to jail

Well Im not a lawyer but from what I can tell this is completely
and utterly untrue

You see this country has this thing called a constitution

If you legitimately aquire the device and you yourself are
not a government employee or otherwise encumbered I dont think they
can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
determine Remember the Pentagon Papers precedent The First Amendment
applies here

The US does NOT have an official secrets act We do have laws that
will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
in your capacity as a government official contractor etc and we
have laws that prohibit stealing such information However if they
sell you the chip I cant see that they can make reverse engineering
it and revealing the details illegal
