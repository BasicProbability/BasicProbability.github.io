Subject Re How does it really work was Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption

	From Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyncsindianaedu

	The majority of the discussion involving this Clipper Chip seems to
	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations  Does anyone
	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
	signals  The language sort of suggests this but its hard to say

Id lay a few bucks that its just dataindataout in parallel  I suspect
to make it a phone youd need a codec and speech compression  There would
be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal which I suspect would scupper
any of the suggestions Ive seen here about putting a different encryption
front end on it

Theres no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs  Im sure its purely
a digital chip  The back end will come later but Im positive it wont
be left to the manufacturers  they all have to be the same modulation
scheme to make it easy for the NSA to tap them

The only other possibility is that this is intended only for ISDN phones
Puts a whole new spin on EFFs obsession about ISDN if true bwahahaha
