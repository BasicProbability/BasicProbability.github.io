  responding to claims about Skipjack cracking engines 

Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
has 280 possible keys  Lets assume a bruteforce engine like that
hypothesized for DES  1 microsecond per trial 1 million chips  Thats
1012 trials per second or about 38000 years for 280 trials  Well
maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build
a machine with 10 million chips  Sure  only 38 years for each solution


	I think I should also point out that the mystical DES engines
are known plaintext engines unless you add a ton of really smart
hardware

	The plaintext is digitized voice and exists for a very short
time probably in a couple inches of copper tops Its flatly not
available  your bug in my office can hear my voice and even digitize
it but its going to get a different bitstream

	It is horribly naive to suppose that regular folks can figure
out how to crack skipjack or clipper based telephones Im certainly
not devoting a great deal of thought to it
