Subject Estimating Wiretap CostsBenefits

Im attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap or Clipper chip is a costeffective tool for
police investigation  That is ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry
and their customers to support this wiretap technology  

A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million
dollars per year to US law enforcement agencies  In 1990 872 US
wiretaps led to 2057 arrests while total police expenditures of 28
billion led to 1125 million arrests ref US Statistical Abstracts
Im working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but
Id like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating
the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology

Please send me quotableciteable estimates for

 How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all
  phones with wiretap chips
 How much would it cost to make each chip
 How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place
 How much more would supporting hardware people etc cost per chip
 What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been
  if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs
 What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed
  law enforcement blocks
 What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year

Put another way the question Im asking is what if each police
agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it being
charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication
to be wiretap compatible  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps or
would they find it more costeffective to instead investigate crimes
in other ways
