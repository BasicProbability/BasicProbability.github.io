Subject Re Facinating facts 30 bit serial number possibly fixed S1 and S2

The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a backdoor
What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial
number


 To generate the unit key for a serial number N the 30bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34bit block to produce a 64bit block N1
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to tripleencrypt N1 producing a
   64bit block R1

	   R1  EDEN1 S1 S2 S1 

   Similarly N is padded with two other 34bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3 and two additional 64bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed  

	   R2  EDEN2 S1 S2 S1 
	   R3  EDEN3 S1 S2 S1 

   R1 R2 and R3 are then concatenated together giving 192 bits The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2  The
   rest are discarded  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies


What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated
Or should I say the need to access the Escrow houses to decrypt the data
The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion
of protection and smalltown cops wont be let in on the secret so they
will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses but the fact
is the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit
keys from the encrypted serial number  Nuff Said
