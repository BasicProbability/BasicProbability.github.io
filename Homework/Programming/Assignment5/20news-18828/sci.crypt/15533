BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE

 Why do we hackers care about the Clipper chip  Do we give a shit
 about anybodys privacy accept our own  And perhaps not even our
 own are we so smart that we always know when were talking to
 somebody who has a wiretap on their phone

I find this a very disturbing view  Yes we DO care about EVERYONEs
privacy Even if they dont know it What happens if the govt
starts creating legislation such that the Clipper and such
technologies become the only legal encryption forms  What happens
when the Clipper is the ONLY type of encryption chips available to
the masses

Sure you might have your own method of encryption but if you dont
have anyone else to talk to what use is it  You cant assume that
EVERYONE will be as open as you appear to be about encryption

The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip
Rather it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key safedeposit box keys etc and telling you
that they wont use them unless its totally neccessary  I sure
wouldnt want that  Why should encryption be any different
