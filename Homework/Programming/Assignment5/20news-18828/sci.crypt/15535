Actually I am completely baffled by why Dorothy Denning has chosen
to throw away her academic respectability like this  It looks to me
like a major Career Limiting Move  There can be very few people
who know what shes been saying who take her seriously any more

	Actually Ive been following her remarks for some time with
interest Im also a member of academia and her remarks have nothing
but elevate her respectability in my eyes It remains to be seen whether
you are the radical fringe or I

	It is generally an error to assume that your beliefs are held by
the majority or even a sizable minority Especially when youre seeing
tens nay dozens of people on usenet agreeing with you
