Finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments
there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications
in the network for expostfacto scrutiny once some criminal act is
discovered and the instruments involved have been identified

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained  I can even imagine this
being found legal and constitutional since nothing is actually listened to
until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained

Imagine archiving all payphone conversations so if someone turns out
to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals  And
archive calls tofrom suspected Mafia members potential terrorists
radicals etc  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to
get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center
bombers made in the past year

Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why
wouldnt it happen
