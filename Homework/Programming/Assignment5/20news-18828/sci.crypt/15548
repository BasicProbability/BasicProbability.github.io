Finally can anyone even concieve of a timeplace where 128 bit keys arent
sufficient  I certainly cant  even at a trillion keys a second it
would take about 10 billion years to search just one billionth of that keys

   It depends on the attack  Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of
work to be done in a straight bruteforce attack where you try every single
possible key until one works  Processing and storage requirements for this
kind of attack on a 128bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively
impossible  However there may be other attacks whose difficulty is for
example proportional to say 2sqrtn or some such  Also a long
key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little
of the key at a time
