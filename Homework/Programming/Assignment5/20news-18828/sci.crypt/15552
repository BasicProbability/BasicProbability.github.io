  The copsfeds do not need to be able to get hold of your private key to
  listen in to cellular conversations  Encryption is not endtoend but 
  cellphone to basestation


 That was true for the UK Paul but Im fairly sure theyre talking about
 building endtoend encryption phones out of this chip  Its not for
 cellular though it certainly could be used there in the way you suggest

Id lost the White Houses deathless prose when I posted thats what happens
when you read news at home when youre ratarsed but I did have a bunch
of followups going on about cellularcordless comms  The original article
has reappeared so

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement

Hmm telephone communications could indeed include endtoend encryption on
ordinary landlines

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links

OK its far from clear exactly what Cripple what an apposite anagram will
be applied to but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones and he wouldnt
even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqys
misfortunes

Yes Cripple might be for endtoend encyption dropping to clear
when the other end doesnt have Cripple  But then a cordlesstoordinary
conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present  Nope I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links

OK its possible telecommunications networks could mean ordinary phone
lines but Im betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos

My apologies if Im wrong particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that Im wrong and I missed it but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation and anyone expecting endtoend encryption is in for a surprise
IMHO


BTW Graham Ive posted questions to altsecuritypgp and not seen any
repliesfollowups from outside Europe  how about you  Have I made it into
everyones kill file or is there some problem

 Paul
