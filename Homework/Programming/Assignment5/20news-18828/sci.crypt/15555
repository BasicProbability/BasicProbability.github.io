 Heres a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
 one Make it voluntary

As usually you are not reading The proposal does say that it is a
voluntary program This doesnt make it more desirable though

 That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
 to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

Secure How do you know Because NSA is trying to make you believe it
Trust us Yeah right

Otherwise you are on your own How do you know that tomorrow they
will not outlaw encrypring devices that dont use their technology
Because they are promising you Gee they are not doing even that 
read the proposal again

One minor nitpick  It is not a proposal  It is a DECISION  from their
point of view it is a DONE DEAL  The chips are being manufactured it
obviously has been budgeted the whole thing  THAT IS WHAT IS SO UPSETTING
THIS WAS ALL DONE IN SECRET  Because they DIDNT want the people to know
what was going on until it is too late

Otherwise I agree with you 100 percent

How come it always takes someone who has lived under the Eastern Bloc to
remind us about how precious and fragile our liberties are

Please keep up the good work  Hopefully you will wake SOMEONE up
