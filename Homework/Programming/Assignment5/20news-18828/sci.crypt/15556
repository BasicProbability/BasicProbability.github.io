What we need is a true privacy chip  For example a realtime 
voiceencryption RSA silicon compile it and spit out ASIC  
Put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
business diplomats and private communications  If the US bans 
it we make it somewhere else and import it  The Japanese German
Dutch Taiwanese Korean etc electronics companies dont want the 
NSA spying on them  US workers lose more jobs to government fascist
stupidity


Some countries have laws about importing crypto gearI believe the US
does Without a license the above scheme wont work at least not legally
in such countries including at least France and the US
