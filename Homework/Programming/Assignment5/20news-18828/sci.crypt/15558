The point here is not the specific instance of the Wiretap Chip
Rather it is like having the government telling you that they want a
copy of your house key safedeposit box keys etc and telling you
that they wont use them unless its totally neccessary  I sure
wouldnt want that  Why should encryption be any different

Actually the govrnment is telling you that if you want to use their
product the manufacturer actually better yet some trusted pair
of escrow agencies has to have the key

Most of us already are in this situationour car makers have keys to our
cars or can get them quickly from the VIN  number and I have no doubt
that if presented with a court order theyd surrender copies to the
government

Chances are that many locksmiths have the code numbers for house locks
theyve installed and in an emergency can cut keys thus theyd also
provide such keys to the government pursuant to a court order

The state has no difficulty gaining access to your safe deposit box if they
have a court order

Bad analogy

This is not to argue for or against the proposal but rather better
distinctions are required in thinking about it than house key safedeposit
keys etc
