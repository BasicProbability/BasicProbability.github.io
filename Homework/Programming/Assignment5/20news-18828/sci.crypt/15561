Subject Re Hard drive security for FBI targets

In article Apr1301185569422yumaACNSColoStateEDU hollandCSColoStateEDU douglas craig holland writes
Im not a lawyer so correct me if Im wrong but doing that could be
considered obstruction of justice which could land you in prison for
quite a while

The thing thats great about the secret key is it is IDEA encrypted so
even if the FBI do get the key theyre SOL unless they know the magic
word  If they try to force you to give them your pass phrase just say
Oops I forgot  Since the burden of proof is still on the prosecution
in this country if you keep your mouth shut how can they prove that you
didnt forget your pass phrase

  OK Doug is right it would be obstruction of justice blah blah blah
BUT saying I forgot is a lie which is just as bad from a moral point
of view IF you think lawfulness is a good in and of itself which 
admittedly most people do not  But theres an even better way out of this
PROVIDED the government is prosecuting you criminally you can probably
plead the fifth amendmeent and thus LEGALLY avoid revealing your key  The
government cannot demand information from a criminal defendant which may
tend to incriminate that defendant  Though this has never been applied
in the cryptography context at least as far as I can tell it seems an
obvious application to me  

 This may be a common suggestion in this group but if its not Im new
here Id love to hear what people have to say about it  Since I dont
really read this group and since the subject matter is more legal than
cryptoid maybe misclegalcomputing would be an appropriate place
