Im attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the
proposed wiretap or Clipper chip is a costeffective tool for
police investigation  That is ignoring concerns about government
intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to
investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry
and their customers to support this wiretap technology  


First what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvewmission
                                                                         
Do us a favor  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA  Go
do useful work for the society

Whew  Take it easy on the guy  Maybe hes going to do this in his
spare time  Maybe hes going to do this to see how much a wiretap
really costs  Maybe hes going to do this so he can add to the
opposition to Clipper  I dont know fully why he might do this but
maybe we shouldnt start flaming at the drop of a hat
