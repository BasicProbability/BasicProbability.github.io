Subject Looking for MSDOS crypto programs
From EXTDSMLURELATROBEEDUAU MADDISONDavid

I am a new reader of scicrypt I would like to obtain a copy of a
public domain program that can encrypt files preferably using DES
that runs under MSDOS

I would also like to obtain a program which will password protect
floppy disks if this is possible

Thanks
