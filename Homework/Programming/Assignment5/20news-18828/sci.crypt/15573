Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
has 280 possible keys  Lets assume a bruteforce engine like that
hypothesized for DES  1 microsecond per trial 1 million chips  Thats
1012 trials per second or about 38000 years for 280 trials  Well
maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build
a machine with 10 million chips  Sure  only 38 years for each solution

Normally Id be the last to argue with Steve    but shouldnt that
read 38 years for all solutions  I mean if we can imagine the
machine that does 1 trialnanosecond we can imagine the storage medium
that could index and archive it
