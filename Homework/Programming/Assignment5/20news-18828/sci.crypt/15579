	This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the antichrist
Just for the hell of it lets destroy this remark Let us imagine that
the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses
without anyone knowing or telling Now what Dick has 80 bits of data
What the hells he gonna do with it

	1 Trot around to the telco and say wed like an unauthorised
decrypting tap Uh huh
	2 Break in to watergate and install his own tap so his people still
do have to break in neat huh record some noise then get the Executive
Branch Phone Decryption Box huh theyve got one Goodness wait til the
washington post gets hold of this and decrypt the noise
	3 More likely stare at the key and say Oh hell its not
worth all this bloody hassle


No he gives the keys to the FBI who may then give them to the local police
on request who then simply put some alagator clips on your phone junction
box and conduct an illegal tap They then decrypt when they recover the tape
Its just doing what the government does best breaking the law
