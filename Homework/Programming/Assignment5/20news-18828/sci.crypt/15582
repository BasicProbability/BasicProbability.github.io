Normally Id be the last to argue with Steve    but shouldnt that
read 38 years for all solutions  I mean if we can imagine the
machine that does 1 trialnanosecond we can imagine the storage medium
that could index and archive it
 
   Hmmmm  I think with really large keyspaces like this you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES  Attempt decryption of several
blocks and check the disctribution of the contents  I dont think its
at all feasible to keep 280 encryptions of a known plaintext block on
any amount of tape or CDROM  And certainly not 2128 such encrypted
blocks  Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device
 
   Actually a keysearch of this kind shouldnt be much worse than the
simpler kind in terms of speed  Its just that you have to do it over
for every encrypted message
 
   Dumb question  Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many
legitimate ASCIIencoded 8byte blocks there are that could be part of
an english sentence  For attacking DES in ECB mode it seems like a
dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable
