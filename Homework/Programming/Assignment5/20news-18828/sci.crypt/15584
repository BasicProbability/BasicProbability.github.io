Normally Id be the last to argue with Steve    but shouldnt that
read 38 years for all solutions  I mean if we can imagine the
machine that does 1 trialnanosecond we can imagine the storage medium
that could index and archive it
 
   Hmmmm  I think with really large keyspaces like this you need to
alter the strategy discussed for DES  Attempt decryption of several
blocks and check the disctribution of the contents  I dont think its
at all feasible to keep 280 encryptions of a known plaintext block on
any amount of tape or CDROM  And certainly not 2128 such encrypted
blocks  Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
system into a one bit storage device


I dont claim to be a crypto analyist there isnt a whole lot of good
literature on the subject and the best people dont seem to publish
their work   but I rather doubt the approach such folks use is brute
force sorry to have implied that in my previous post  The history
of these things is folks find clever ways of limiting the search and
bang from there

I guess my real problem with Skipjack is I can not believe NSA would
make publicly available a system they couldnt break if they wanted
it just isnt in their charter  Remember DES came from IBM not NSA
and when first published was given a useful life of 20 years I think
we are well past that point now 

Remember based on the size of the NSA budget they spend a lot more
on the technology of decryption than most computer companies spend on
RD  I have to imagine their stuff is real interesting

A friend who once worked for them he is dead now said he always enjoyed
monitoring SACs Strategic Air Command crypto traffic   and I rather
suspect that stuff is a bit more complex than Skipjack  Or was it the
military got the stuff from the NSA just like we get Skipjack from them 
BTW folks NSA wasnt being given the keys  And the Walker spy case
shows for some of the systems the KGB didnt need them either
