Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security

One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability at a higher degree of 
security than we currently have in nonproprietary voice encryption systems
This means it will be cheaper than anyones proprietary scheme and easier to 
deploy

I may be an anarchist nutcase but I wouldnt have frothed overmuch
had the government proposed a secure encryption standard  In fact
if the NSA had come up with a privacy chip rather than a wiretap
chip I would have been happy  They could have done this  set
up an ANSI committee picked a secure cryptosystem defined a
protocol and interface and said Hey start building them

Instead we have a deliberately braindead version of a cryptosystem
that has not even been peer reviewed  Yes the NSA owns some smart
people  But if they pulled a FEAL well ATT is going to be left
with a lot of dud phones on its hands

Perry said
 Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in 
 exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography 

Can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right

Heh heh  The government already gave it up for us  Remember in the
announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two
extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a
Constitutional right to encryption  

So much for Clintons support of the right of privacy
