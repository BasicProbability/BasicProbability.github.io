not very comprehensive list deleted

There is a very comprehensive list in scimathsymbolic 
which detailed descriptions of many packages 
Especially you Mark should update your list  
Here it is 


			Available    Systems

This is the  list of  currently  developed  and   distributed  software  for 
symbolic math applications No informations is supplied on systems no longer 
being supported like SAINT FORMAC ALPAK ALTRAN MATHLAB SIN SAC CAMAL 
ScratchPad MuMath SHEEP TRIGMAN ANALITIK SMP or CCALC

For more detailed info on any of the systems below  look into the directory
pubSymbolicMath in the anonymous FTP of mathberkeleyedu No particular 
recommendation is made for any of these      If you want prices contact the 
company Programs are listed by aprox the reverse order of the number  of 
machines they run on in each class general purpose systems first

If you have any information to add to this list we know we are missing
MuPAD  FELIX please send it to
