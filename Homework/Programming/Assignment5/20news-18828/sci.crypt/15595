Subject Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption

In article 1qmugcINNpu9gapcaltechedu halccocaltechedu Hal Finney writes
The key question is whether nonClipper encryption will be made illegal

It seems pretty obvious that it will be made illegal if VERY LOUD NOISE is
not made about this IMMEDIATELY to Congress and the House

It looks like the worst nightmares raised by Dorothy Dennings proposals
are coming true  If the government continues on this course I imagine
that we will see strong cryptography made illegal  Encryption programs
for disk files and email as well as software to allow for encrypted
voice communications will be distributed only through the
underground  People will have to learn how to hide the fact that
they are protecting their privacy
 
I dont know whats worse  the waste of money or the fact that in SPITE
of all Clintons rhetoric to the contrary this is a feeble attempt by
a large group of bored intelligence bureaucrats to justify their currently
useless jobs Clinton said he was going to trim the fat from the government
This doesnt look very dietetic to me 

As I said before in this group drug dealing and terrorism both tend to
be international crimes which are not going to cease if the US starts to
regulate encryption The drug dealers and terrorists will simply go to
other countries to communicate their plans and will still carry them out
here andor wherever else This is not the solution to the problem

They try to invent a new problem by saying we need encryption I guess
its a good thing Bill Gates isnt a 4star general or we would all need
our own copies of MSDOS too right

Und vee haff vays uff findink out iff you are usink DOCTOR DOS

Its shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here

Our health care and education systems are in the toilet and they come up
with THIS pearl If this goddamned government doesnt get a clue real quick
and start trying to repair the infrastructure of the country rather than
inventing someone to blame Germany and Japan are going to eat the US alive
and we will deserve it Its not like theres any shortage of REAL problems
to solve guys 

A Clipper chip is really going to help the homeless A Clipper chip is
really going to help educate the children in the ghettos of our cities
Just think of the generation gap that can be developed when they rehire
DoD engineer dad to work on Clipper chips that will be used to decrypt
slightly rebellious adolescent hacker sons naughty GIF files I can see
the shitcom already

If that wasnt a forged post or a sick joke Im popping that Dead Kennedys
tape into the car stereo and tearing ass to Canada Clinton on White Horse
is near Its the suededenim secret police They have come for your uncool
niece Dont worry its only a phoneshit I knew I should have gotten
some of those consent to monitoring stickers they keep on Autovon phones
when I had the chance I should have known Id need them in civilian life
