Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security

 Instead we have a deliberately braindead version of a cryptosystem 
 that has not even been peer reviewed  Yes the NSA owns some smart 
 people  But if they pulled a FEAL well ATT is going to be left with 
 a lot of dud phones on its hands 

Agreed  Remember I dont even think of Clipper as encryption in any real 
senseif I did Id probably be a lot more annoyed about it

 Heh heh  The government already gave it up for us  Remember in the 
 announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two 
 extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a 
 Constitutional right to encryption  

Thats not for Clinton or anyone under him to say though  Only the 
federal and supreme courts can say anything about the constitutionality
Anything the administration or any governmental agency says is opinion at 
best
