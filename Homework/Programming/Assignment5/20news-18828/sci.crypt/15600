   has 280 possible keys  Lets assume a bruteforce engine like that
   hypothesized for DES  1 microsecond per trial 1 million chips  Thats
   1012 trials per second or about 38000 years for 280 trials  Well
   maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build
   a machine with 10 million chips  Sure  only 38 years for each solution

   But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as
proposed  Building a brute force machine to test 240 possible keys
if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY  One chip
one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks and that
break gives you all messages involving that phone

   The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you
nothing is an improvement but notice that XORing with truely random
bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents  Using 
for XOR SK for the escrowed key and A and B for two random bit
strings hand SKAB SKA and SKB to three escrow agents  It is
possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern
for example 3 of 4 such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives
the cracking agency no benefit
