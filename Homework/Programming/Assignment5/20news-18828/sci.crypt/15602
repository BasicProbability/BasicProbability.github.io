 Do you know of any freely distributable c or c code for public
 key cryptography such as RSA  

 Ive tried various archie searches to no avail  

Have you heard of PGP I assume from your post that you have not PGP 22
is a freeware RSA encryption program which includes digital signatures and
comprehensive key management facilities Most sites also keep the source code
A growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt to
a very high standard their email and data Get it before Clinton outlaws it

Two of the many sites are
      rsacom     pubpgp
      sodaberkeleyedu      pubcypherpunkspgp

Hope this helps

Jon
