Seems like sombody didnt like your snooping around Marc

Or the more likely explanation is that Marc is spoofing
                                          
I sincerely doubt that Denning and crew are keen enough to react that
quickly and I doubt theyd want to cripple their SMTP server tboot


Marc is not spoofing  Try it yourself  At least the commands work
exactly as he described ie they do not work
