 It means that the EFFs public stance is complicated with issues irrelevant
 to the encryption issue per se There may well be people who care about
 the encryption issue who dont care to associate themselves with the
 network erotica issue or may even disagree with the EFFs position

Perhaps these encryptiononly types would defend the digitized porn if it
was posted encrypted

These issues are not as seperable as you maintain
