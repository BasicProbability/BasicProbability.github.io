   	The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
   government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
   design that the Feds say that NSA developed  Is there a patent  Is that
   patent publicly available  My betting is that that too is classified

   Unless there has been a major change in the law theres no such beast
   as a classified patent  Patents exist to encourage communications and
   develop the state of the art 

While there arent classified patents there are patent secrecy orders

Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio and apply for a patent
The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested gives them a copy
of your application and you get a nice note back saying your patent
application has now been classified for national security reasons and
youre no longer allowed to make and sell it  
Im picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s
It was probably some analog scrambler and would have probably
violated FCC rules anyway but it did get classified

Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and
then file a patent application  Since its been published
they cant gain anything by classifying it though you cant get
patents in most countries other than the US where patent laws are different

Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus
You cant sell that widget because theres a classified patent on it
Youre not allowed to see the patent or know who owns the design
so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we wont throw
you in jail for espionage  Some countries might have that kind of
system  but we dont have that here  Quite  Yet
