 Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
 has 280 possible keys
 
 We dont yet know if all 80 bits count

That doesnt worry me at all theyre not going to cheat at something
they can get caught at  And key size is one of the things that can be
verified externally  Feed lots of random keyinput pairs into the
chip then try flipping random key bits and see what happens to the
output  We already know what should happen  about half the output
bits should vary on average from a 1bit key change or input change

If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem it might be the case that
some of the bits are much less powerful than others in the sense that
they only enter into the encryption very late in the game  By contrast
DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible the 50 output
change rate appears as early as round 5  Again though I dont think
NSA is going to cheat that crudely theyre likely to get caught

Remember that theyve promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design  If you assume something DESlike a biased
subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb  The committee
can and should run lots of tests and retain the output  This can be verified
later against the chip  And yes the civilian community has at least some
secure storage facilities that I dont think even NSA can get into without
it being noticed until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again
Oops  I dont think I was supposed to talk about that  The committee
members can even retain secure copies of the code  in two halves which
you have to XOR together to recover the program

Seriously there are I think problems with this whole scheme  But the
people who invented it arent stupid and theyve been in the crypto game
and the smokeandmirrors game far longer than most of us  Theyre not
going to lie in ways that can be detected easily since their credibility
is the only thing they can use to sell this system  If theyve lied
about the civilian committee no one will believe them about the absence
of other back doors  If theyve lied about the key size no one will
believe that they havent copied the programming disk with the U keys
If theyve lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem
no one will believe the escrow agencies arent in cahoots with them

That isnt to say that they arent lying about all those other things
anyway  And Im certainly not claiming that NSA cant build a cryptosystem
with a back door that the committee cant find  look how long it took
for folks to believe that the Sboxes werent sabotaged  Its entirely
possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report for just
such reasons  But thats a subtle point ie one you cant explain to
a Senator

 Anyway its looking like the
 keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA
 can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number

I dont like the unit key generation process any better than you do
However  S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents  If they cant be trusted to keep the seed values secure
they cant be trusted to keep the halfkeys secure

I still dont know if or when S1 and S2 change  I thought I had seen
something about them being constant but I just reread Dennings technical
information post and it doesnt say anything one way or the other
