Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 144K  I think it is Ive heard its not  Lets
say 8 bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at
full rate its a variable rate voice activity vocoder  If you want
less quality cut that to 4000 bps half rate  At full rate variable
you could put two fullduplex conversations on a V32bis modem  This
requires a DSP or ASICs though  An RS6000 has a CPU that could
probably do it in realtime because it has the addandmultiply
instruction and a few other DSP things

If you want to do speech in realtime you need about 4000 samples a
second for not very good voice with your 8 bit samples ISDN is 8000
8bit samples a second which is 32 kbps  You could do a fast 21
compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps which is just about
V32bis  The quality at this point is very bleah but it should work
Now add in the time for your encryption method  Youre going to need
sampling hardware which is no problem on a new Mac an Amiga  Or a
PC with a SoundBlaster card just because theyre so popular and cheap
 you could also build a simple ADC  The problem with the
SoundBlaster is that it doesnt seem to be full duplex  you cant
sample and play backq at the same time making a twoway conversation
a bit tough  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be
required

The only thing that worries me is that 21 compression  the
SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware but other than that
I dont have a good feel for how processor intensive it is so I cant
estimate how fast a PC youd need
