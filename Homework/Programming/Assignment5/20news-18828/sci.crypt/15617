                                  The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
 has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until
 publication

How are you sure of that  Werent there some recent studies that
found corelations between notyet announced decisions and market changes

Arent there continuing early rumors of their deliberations


              Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop
 forecasts from leaking prematurely

Sheesh  Remember the big scandal a year or two or 3 ago about
exactly such leaks
