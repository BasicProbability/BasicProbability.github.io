Subject Re THE CLIPPER CHIP A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

In article 1993Apr191823273420guvaxaccgeorgetownedu denningguvaxaccgeorgetownedu writes
	Prof Dennings description of SkipJack mostly omitted

	CHIP STRUCTURE
	The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64bit block encryption
	algorithm called Skipjack  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys compared
	with 56 for the DES and has 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16
	for the DES  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation  Throughput is
	16 Mbits a second 

	F an 80bit family key that is common to all chips
	N a 30bit serial number
	U an 80bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted
		 with the chip
	The key K and message stream M ie digitized voice are then
	fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values

  	   EM K the encrypted message stream and 
	   EEK U  N F a law enforcement block  

Three questions
1 It looks like each 64 bits of input gives you 464 bits of output
		EMK  64 bits
		EKU  E 80 bits   128 bits
		E EKU N  F   E 128  30 bits   192 bits
   Do you really need to transmit all 256 bits each time
   or do you only transmit the 192 bits of wiretap block at the beginning   
   All 256 would be really obnoxious for bandwidthlimited applications
   like cellular phones or even regular phones over 

2 how do the 4 DES modes interact with the twopart output
   Do the various feedback modes only apply to the message block
   or also to the wiretap block  Or if the wiretap block is only
   transmitted at the beginning does it get incorporated into
   everything through feedback modes but not during ECB mode

3 Does the Clipper Chip check the wiretap block itself
   Does the block have to be present at all
   Since the receiving chip doesnt know the transmitters U
   it presumably cant check the validity of EKU so its 
   limited to checking the form of the wiretap block
   and maybe checking the serial number for reasonableness
   unless theres some sort of backdoor structure that lets
   it recognize a valid EKU
   
   In that case can you replace the wiretap block with a DIFFERENT
   wiretap block presumably an old valid one to avoid attracting attention
   The chip wont do it so you postprocess the output
   Regular people can do one with their own serial number and a dummy key
   paranoid people can use someone elses serial number

   On the other hand if I could think of that solution so easily
   presumably the NSA could too  have they done something to block it
   like use message encryption thats really EM KUN 


	Thanks
