 Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations
 I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction
 gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the
 issue as well as the FirstAmendment side

Hmmm this gave me an interesting idea  How about this argument

1  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms

2  Strong cryptography is arms according to the US government thats
    why its so hard to export

Therefore we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography  
QED

However its likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly
restricting  Maybe the NRA would be the best existing organization
Although I think a new one might be better but perhaps would take too long
to start up  I would certainly join
