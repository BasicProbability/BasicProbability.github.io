Subject Re Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine Was Re Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip

   Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
   has 280 possible keys
  
   We dont yet know if all 80 bits count
 
  That doesnt worry me at all theyre not going to cheat at something
 they can get caught at  And key size is one of the things that can be
 verified externally  Feed lots of random keyinput pairs into the
 chip then see what happens to the output

  If the device is designed to use the key thats registered with the Feds
I dont see how you can feed it a different key  If the user can change
the key to any of the 280 possibilities the main reason for regarding
this proposal as unacceptable disappears
