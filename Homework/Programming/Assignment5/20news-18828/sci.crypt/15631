Subject Re Off the shelf cheap DES keyseach machine Was Re Corporate acceptance of the wiretap chip

I dont like the unit key generation process any better than you do
However  S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same
escrow agents  If they cant be trusted to keep the seed values secure
they cant be trusted to keep the halfkeys secure

I hope there is something I dont understand about this system but can
someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining
each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies Dont
both halfs of the key have to come together in some form at the time
the chip is constructed

Or is it built like a fusable prom with the chip being sent to the 1st
escrow agency to program its 12 key then the 2nd agency to program its
12 key but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from
reading the information already programmed by the 1st

This isnt intended to be a flame or anything I am just really curious
how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow
security without simply saying trust the manufacturer they wont look
