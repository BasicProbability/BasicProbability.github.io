As one of the happily sleeping people I would just like to ask this
arent people just slightly overreacting to this  Or are we all of a
sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia

The point of the matter is that yes this is a serious problem  But it is
not the end of the world  Guess what  Were doing something now you
cant do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany  Were complaining about
it or rather youre complaining about it and nobody is shooting at us  

Or rather if theyre shooting at me they have real bad aim   

GUESS WHAT PEOPLE  You live in one of the few countries in the world
where a person can complain without getting shot at  

People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong or somebody
did that wrong or whatever  Sit down and figure out two things

1  What have they done right
2  How much worse can it get

And youll find that you and I are pretty damn lucky

So lets talk about it get some action going decide whats going on 
But lets not overreact  

Us having the liberties to talk about this doesnt make the problem go
away  It doesnt make it right  Rather the opposite if we do not do 
anything about it you can bet its going to get worse
