Remember that theyve promised to let a committee of outside experts see
the cryptosystem design

I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow

any monkey business on this point  they have to expect that the
chip will be reverseengineered sooner or later  its an obvious
opportunity to introduce additional holes
