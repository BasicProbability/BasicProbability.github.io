However its likely to be as hard or harder to exercise this right as it
is getting to exercise the other rights that the government is slowly
restricting  Maybe the NRA would be the best existing organization
Although I think a new one might be better but perhaps would take too
long
to start up  I would certainly join

The NRA is successful because among a number of things on the drop of
a hat they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards
faxes and phone calls  Certainly with our waycool Internet powers of
organization we can act in the same way if such action is appropriate

As long as we are kept informed of events anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action  Hopefully were a strong enough community to act on
those calls  I realize this is a little optomistic and Im glad EFF is
working in the loop on these issues but dont underestimate the
potential of the net for political action
