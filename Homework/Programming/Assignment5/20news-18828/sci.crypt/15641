Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 144K  I think it is Ive heard its not  Lets
say 8 bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

As far as I know ISDN call it Swissnet here and its being plugged in its
8 bit 8000Hz gives you one channel of 64kBitsec I guess you should not go
below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an
analogline Anybody knows compressionalgorithms  factors for voice
