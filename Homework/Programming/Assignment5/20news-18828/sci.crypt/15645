Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 144K  I think it is Ive heard its not  Lets
say 8 bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

Note I am not a cable freak so I might have completely
misunderstood what you said  Also my math is frequently noted for
being wrong so youll better check the calculations yourself

I assume that 144K means 144K Bits  So if we assume one start and
one stopbit and no protocol overhead the effective number of bytes
per second is 144K

Lets also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in
stereo so that you can send 1440 samplessec  This corresponds to a
Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz which should be too low especially if
you think about the 8bit low quality sound  Furthermore your DA
converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been
cut off at 720 Hz but will instead alias in all the higher
frequencies  Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome
that problem

On the other hand speech should be easily compressible  For example
you could form power spectra or you could simply bandpass filter and
then linearize the fourier transforms  It wont be CD quality sound
but itll be discernible  The power spectrum method is very good in
that respect  I have once programmed such a software compressor and
compression rates of 90 with relative errors due to linearization of
less than 5 were common  Although I must say that these were musical
sounds not speech

Have fun
