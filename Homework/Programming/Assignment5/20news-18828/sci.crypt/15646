If the Clinton Clipper is so very good why not make its algrithm public
so many people can exchange ideas and examine it rather than a few

One more time

    If they released the algorithm it would be possible for someone
    to come up with an implementation which was identical but
    lacking an escrowed key

    Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
    being kept secret for security of the key escrow system  In this
    case security means an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip


    Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
    the algorithm and the escrow system which would you buy 

     a  Chip from firm A with the escrowed key
     b  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key
          in government escrow

    There would obviously be powerful economic incentives for a second
    source non escrowed vendor

But what about second sources for pincompatible nonClipper algorithm
chips that also have escrowed keys  If a reputable firm produces a
chip with escrowed key that is a popin replacement for the Clipper
chip in my phone and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated
and trusted then whats the problem

The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization
with sufficient resources can you say billions of cocaine dollars so
those drug dealers theyre so worried about will be slipping through the
cracks  We lawabiding nonincrediblywealthy citizens naturally will
not have this recourse  But claiming that the algorithm cant be
released to prevent people from using nonkeyescrowed chips is plain
deceitful analysis of the chip output will provide information on
the necessary headers and whatnot so the bad guys could build chips
using a different algorithm and still not escrow their keys

Or they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at Kmart every week
and play SwaptheClipperChip with their cellular phone every day
