Subject Re How to detect use of an illegal cipher

As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto they are trying to coopt it Their contention that they 
need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm More likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont 
have the keys registered Anyone else notice that in their QA session they

Preventing black market chips wnonescrowed keys IS exactly what they
mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system  There are
two parts to the security of such a system
  
    a Preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
    b Assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper
        traffic when it authorizes itself to do so

Of course the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about
a and very little about b

    lunacy
