Would you trust a blackbox from the NSA versus an open system from
elsewhere

Absolutely if I were assured by someone I trusted that the black box was
more secure I have nothing to conceal from the government but I would like
to be sure that any Russian Japanese French or other competitors for my
services cant read my traffic Id like to be sure that competitive bid
information was safe from commercial competitors and foreign governments
which would aid them

I believe the NSA has identical motivations with respect to my activities
The President and many other senior government officials have made it very
clear that they share these motivations Thus Id trust them on the
coincidence of interests argument as well as on a basic trust in their
professionalism and a high confidence in their skills
