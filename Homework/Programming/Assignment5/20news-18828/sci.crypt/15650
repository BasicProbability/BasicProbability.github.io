 Lets assume for the moment that the system really is secure unless
 you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
 escrow houses  Lets say you even trust the escrow houses  one is
 the ACLU and the other is the EFF  And Im not entirely joking about
 those two names

The problem with Lets assume reasoning is that taken to the extreme
and youre close you arrive at Lets assume this is perfectly OK

The assumptions you make are big ones If the system is really secure then
why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret  There are plenty
of encryption algorithms that dont depend upon nondisclosure to be secure
so why in the world use one that does  There are reasons of course but
I certainly cant think of any honest ones

Next you assume we can trust the escrow houses But the last time I checked
EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure
corruption and even fabrication of supposedly secure data The govt is
saying Yeah but NOW were serious so you can trust us  Bullcrypt 

And finally although you didnt state it explicitly you implicitly assume
that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable The case
in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately
fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this
score

Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers right  As others
have pointed out the current proposal will if deployed render truly secure
encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sams brand
Who will be able to afford and be sufficiently motivated to purchase this
expensive inconvenient higher protection  Somebody with lots of extra
cash

The following is more true than ever

  When strong encryption is outlawed only outlaws will have strong
encryption
