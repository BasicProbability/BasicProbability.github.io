 Heres a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
 one Make it voluntary
 
 That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
 to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

  As an economist Im sure you can see the flaws in this logic If the naive
market is flooded with proprietary but weak encryption then truly strong 
encryption will be unable to compete Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast
standard and then sold TVs below cost Private industry has a better standard
but its not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the market
with cheap proprietary sets Even though the industrys technology is better
the programming is being broadcast to the govts unduplicatable standard
Who could compete

  The other flaw of course is that making something voluntary today ensures
that it will be voluntary in the future I went to renew my CA drivers license
last week and was required not only to give my SSN but to PRODUCE AN SSN
CARD to veryify the number  Note that a federal law once said that no state
or local govt could ever require the use of SSNs for drivers license registration
specifically

   I do not trust the govt that says trust me on this even though we could
have an arrangement that doesnt require your trust  Something is big
time fishy If you look more carefully youll see it
