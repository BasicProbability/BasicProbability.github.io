Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

It might be nice to

1 cut out the ad hominem attacks on Prof Denning Mr Sternlight
etc  If you have something objective to say about their views go
ahead and say it subject to point 2  Personal attacks reflect more
on the attacker more than on the attackee  Throw light not heat

2 restrict the discussion to appropriate newsgroups I submit that
comporgacm and comporgieee are not appropriate for this
discussion  You have now made subscribers to these newsgroups aware of
the issue  If they want to know more or participate in the discussion
they can easily join scicrypt compsecuritymisc altsecurity or
comporgefftalk
