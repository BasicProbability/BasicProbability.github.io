I guess the cryptowranglers read this group too  But of
course I knew that because it is so easy to do  There is
not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes
every significant gateway or bone is captured for the
colligation of data about   Maybe your name is here

	I really like these claims Where did they come from We hear
practically daily that the NSA monitors oh everything They can
crack anything Theyd never release a cryptosystem they couldnt crack

	Where do people get these fascinating facts The Puzzle Palace
If you can get it for a buck 2nd hand it must be true eh Im pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to among many other things provide highquality
cryptosystems to a variety of places I dont recall reading anywhere
reliable that theyre supposed to

	1 Monitor my phonecalls
	2 Monitor usenet
	3 Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack
	4 etc etc

	This is not to say that they dont they might But you dont
know that they do and you have no evidence that they do for almost
all values of you It follows therefore that for most values of you
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia
