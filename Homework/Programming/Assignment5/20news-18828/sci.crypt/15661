 I dont get up in arms when 
 the government fails to protect the interests of the people because in 
 my lifetime it never hastherefore I have no expectation that it will 

Just to make sure everyone is clear on this it never has refers to 
protects not fails to protect ie in my lifetime I have never seen 
the US government consistently protect the interest of US citizens 
except by accident
