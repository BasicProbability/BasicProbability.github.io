Wouldnt a a second monitor of similar type scrolling gibberish and adjacent
to the one being used provide reasonable resistance to tempest attacks

It would be in a different location so a directional antenna could
probably lock in on just the one monitor Failing that a phased array
could likely seperate the signals Admittedly this is expensive but
so is all the rest of this stuff anyway
