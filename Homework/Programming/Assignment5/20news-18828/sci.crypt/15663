 Thousands  Tens of thousands  Do some arithmetic please  Skipjack
 has 280 possible keys  Lets assume a bruteforce engine like that
 hypothesized for DES  1 microsecond per trial 1 million chips  Thats
 1012 trials per second or about 38000 years for 280 trials  Well
 maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond and build
 a machine with 10 million chips  Sure  only 38 years for each solution
 
 Normally Id be the last to argue with Steve    but shouldnt that
 read 38 years for all solutions  I mean if we can imagine the
 machine that does 1 trialnanosecond we can imagine the storage medium
 that could index and archive it

At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was des encryped
and the person that had sent it went on vaction  Rather than wait two weeks
I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time  It only took two2
days to crack the file  No I dont have any faith in DES
