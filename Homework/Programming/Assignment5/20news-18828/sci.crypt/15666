So dont just think of replacements for clipper also think of front
ends

This only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative nonescrowed
encryption schemes Otherwise why not just use the front end without
clipper

Because that will make private encryption stick out like a sore thumb
and the government will start to take a sharp interest in everything you
do
