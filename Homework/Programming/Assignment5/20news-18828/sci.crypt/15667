If the Clinton Clipper is so very good 

Please note that Bill Clinton probably has little if anything to do
with the design implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind
any moves being made using this chip as a pawn

Uh I notice he has not either asked for or allowed public input and he damn
sure has not stopped it

Remember when you elect a president of the united states its not
the case that all the Republicans etc in the NSA and FBI and CIA
immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
Democrats  Most of the government  say 96  is appointed or
hired rather than elected  Since this Clipper device has been in
production for over six months it probably has little or no 
foundation in the currently elected Democratic Executive body

Again if it was something Clinton didnt like how come he did not
stop it or get PUBLIC input before implimenting the DECISION  He
sure has asserted his authority on other things he did not agree with
from the Bush administrationk I notice   He is the president therefore
he is RESPONSIBLE for the actions of the Execuitive Branch  I have
not the slightest bit of doubt you would be holding Bush or Reagan
to that standard had they been in office when this thing was cast into
stone

BTW  those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton believe
this  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed
this thing  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights
under the Constitution or Bill of Rights  The last couple of decades
have been a nonstop series of endruns around the protections of the
Constitution  It has to stop  Now is as good a time as any if it
isnt too late allready

Could be  However the sky hasnt fallen yet Chicken Little

Thanks for the namecalling  That really makes your position higly
credible  Lenin had a term for folks with your outlook  Do you REALLY
have THAT MUCH faith in the trustworthiness and honesty of the government
that is primarily concerned with people control   I suspect you will
be in for an unpleasant surprise  I would just as soon see this nipped
in the bud whileif it still can be done instead of waiting for yet
more abridgements of our Bill of Rights thank you
