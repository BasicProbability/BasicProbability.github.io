Subject Re I have seen the lobby and it is us

Certainly with our waycool Internet powers of
organization we can act in the same way if such action is appropriate

As long as we are kept informed of events anyone on this bboard can make
a call to action  Hopefully were a strong enough community to act on
those calls  I realize this is a little optomistic and Im glad EFF is
working in the loop on these issues but dont underestimate the
potential of the net for political action

 I speak for myself

I second the motion

All in favor

BTW a few days ago Charles Fee CXF111psuvmpsuedu posted the names
addresses and phone numbers voice and fax of almost all the 103rd 
congresss members  This info along witha great number of cabinet men etc
I captured it as did many others I am sure

We should single out a few of the people on the list and bombard them 
with lobbying against the Clipper Chip et al
