Subject DOS 60 compression API partial answer

For those of you looking for information on MSDOS 60s
file system compression API

Today I called Microsofts DOS 60 hotline at 8002287007
They told me that the DOS 60 Resource Kit had the specifications
for the compression interface  The Resource Kit costs 1995
plus tax and 5 shipping

I ordered a copy and will post further when I get it and know more
about it  I am posting now because the order turnaround is 15 
working days  

If anyone knows for sure wheres theres a good
source of info on this API please speak up  I am 
slightly skeptical about the Resource Kits likelihood
of having detailed programming info

posted also to scicrypt since the API could presumably also
be used for file system encryption
