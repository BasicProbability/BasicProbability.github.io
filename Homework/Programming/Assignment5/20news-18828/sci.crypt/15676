      Dont get fooled by exponents 280 possible keys is not in the
same league with 1080 particles in the universe  280  1025
Remember Avagadros number  There are about that many elementary
particles not molecules in one mole  Pretty small universe  Or if
you can put 5 Gigabytes on one tape you would need about 10 trillion
tapes allowing several bytes per entry  Still more than all of the
existing magnetic media on the planet but wait a few years  Im
including existing audio and video cassettes in the total  Ten
trillion is about 2000 per person worldwide  Gives new meaning to
the suspicions of hiden messages
