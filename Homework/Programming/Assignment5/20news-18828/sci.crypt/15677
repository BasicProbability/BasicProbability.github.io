each of the two escrow databases Fits conveniently on a single very
valuable Exabyte tape This can only get easier with time but who
cares  I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my
pocket on two 8mm tapes

Excellent point and theres a related point Id like to make
Theyll have to back up these databases themselves wont they
How many tape copies will there be and how secure will the
tapes be  If they store them offsite it wouldnt be too
hard to hijack them in transit  If theyre all kept onsite
one good bomb attack by some group intent on freeing us from
the threat of government snooping will take care of the problem
once and for all  I can see it now  Hi were from the
government and we um misplaced our copy of your key  Could
you mail us a copy
