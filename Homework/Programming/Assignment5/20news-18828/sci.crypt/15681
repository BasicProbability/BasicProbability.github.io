First what the fuck is NASA doing wasting my tax dollars doing
policy papers on stuff far outside of their purvewmission

I dont think theyre paying for it

Do us a favor  Resign rather than right this paper for NASA  Go
do useful work for the society

Useful  I find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
of 5 million quite useful if rough eg wiretaps may be
preferentially used on otherwisehardtocatch criminals resulting
in an underestimate  This comes to twenty cents a head over the
US population  I would find some rigorous numbers on this quite
useful  it would make for nice slogans Your privacy is worth
037 or whatever it turns out to be
