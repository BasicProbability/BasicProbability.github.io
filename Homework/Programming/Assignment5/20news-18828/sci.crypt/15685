Subject political point of attack Clipper infrastructure

My earlier argument that Clipper will encourage state and local cops 
to commit criminal acts is largely moot now that weve learned that 
the FBI will perform the actual tap  It will encourage the FBI to
commit even more criminal acts but thats not the point here

But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal  When
the EFFACLUCPSR FOIA requests are made they should ask for details
on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed or 
even already budgeted for the FBI to service tapping requests  for now
and the projected future 

From these figures estimate the number of Clippertap requests the FBI
is expecting  Publish this figure  Compare it on a percapita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected

Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more
Clippertapping stations and how rapidly they could be built and
installed  ie get the plus or minus epsilon for the near future

Might be a mite disturbing for J Q Public to know these things

And despite all the technical details BTW thanks to those whove been
providing them we still dont know 

1 how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated though
   it isnt too hard to guess a good scheme

2 how the results will be securely transmitted Fed Ex the audio tapes

3 how privacy will be reestablished when an investigation is complete
