 Imagine archiving all payphone conversations so if someone turns out
 to be a drug dealer you can listen to all their past drug deals  And
 archive calls tofrom suspected Mafia members potential terrorists
 radicals etc  Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to
 get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center
 bombers made in the past year
 
 Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do why
 wouldnt it happen

Apart from the storage and search requirements because the evidence
is inadmissible  wiretaps require a warrant  And as soon as one
such case comes to light all previous cases are likely to be discovered
and thrown out  There was an article in the NY Times a few months ago
about how many convictions in the state might be invalidated because
they relied on pen registers  and the Court of Appeals ruled that
pen registers were equivalent to wiretaps and hence required warrants
under New York law
