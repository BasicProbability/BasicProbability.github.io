From eabmscedu Edward Bertsch
Subject Re I have seen the lobby and it is us

I agree that notifying your elected officials of your feelings on this
and any other for that matter issue is the way to go  And by the
way the phone s on the list posted the other day were all in Washington
DC    For most of you your elected officials will also maintain
a local office in your area code

When I manage my elected officials I use their local office s
exclusively and my fax modem and windowsprintcapture software are
my tool of choice  They see my words as I have stated them rather
than a summary as they would if I called in voice and left a
comment with the office staff
