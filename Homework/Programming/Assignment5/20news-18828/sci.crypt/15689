 Do you know of any freely distributable c or c code for public
 key cryptography such as RSA  

 Ive tried various archie searches to no avail  

Have you heard of PGP I assume from your post that you have not PGP 22
is a freeware RSA encryption program which includes digital signatures and
comprehensive key management facilities Most sites also keep the source code
A growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt to
a very high standard their email and data Get it before Clinton outlaws it

Two of the many sites are
      rsacom     pubpgp
      sodaberkeleyedu      pubcypherpunkspgp

PGP is not available on the archive site rsacom  If it were it
would be highly amusing since rsacom actually Public Key Partners
but its the same entity is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually make use or sell PGP
I believe those patents also apply in Canada but Im not a patent
lawyer or anything

There is no such thing as freely redistributable code for RSA which
can be used in North America without legal entanglements  You may
wish to consider RSAREF however which is available from the FTP
site rsacom in rsaref but probably doesnt meet your definition of
freely redistributable its readily available in source in C and
does RSA MD5 etc and comes with a license allowing noncommercial
use  Like any other strong crypto software its not exportable
legally  It can be modified with permission from RSADSI which a
number of people have received in the past  For reasons that arent
entirely clear to me RSA says that only US people should take
RSAREF from its server although there arent ITAR issues regarding
Canada  The RIPEM distribution site ripemmsuedu has RSAREF in its
distribution and is OK for Canadians
