Subject Re Would clipper make a good cover for other encryption method

 Chances are the government has thought of this and just anyone wont be
 permitted access to enough of the internals to make a fake clipper chip
 Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals
 at a very high level and manufacturers are required to observe security
 safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level

Assume in this case the usual canardadversary of narcotraficantes  They
probably have more cash than the KGB did and theyre probably more generous
at handing it out  It will be easier than ever to find or cultivate Walkers
and Pollards for the keys and it will be easy enough to find someone to
reverseengineer the chip unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and
effective
