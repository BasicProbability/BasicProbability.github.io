Gee Say they feed the 80bit key through Snefru8 and take the first 60
bits of the result then use those 60 bits as the real key How do you
figure out that each key is one of 220 equal keys You can try a
birthday attack but if the key can be changed only once a second then
you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics Somehow I
dont think you could catch the NSA at this sort of skulduggery
