They may collect the data but making sense of it is another matter

On scicrypt Im a graduate CS major with strong math background and
experienced programmer taking a cryptology course   keyword for
alleged NSA filters

On sciskeptic Im an exphysics major whos a newage flake talking
about silly things like how a persons expectations colors what he
sees

On talkreligionnewage Im a physics geek who enjoys squashing
interesting idea with WASP science although I do write occasional
posts showing a minimal knowledge of Zen mythology etc

I could go on but Im sure you see my point  Im a single person
but I react differently on different groups admittedly in part
because Im a contrarian you always shouts but on the other hand
On top of that I loath certainty and have taken public positions
in the past for no reason other than to challenge conventional wisdom
I wish them luck in figuring out who I am based on that information

They can probably figure out Im liberal with a technical degree
but humanistic interests from a common thread throughout my posts
But that describes a fair portion of the users of Internet
