Subject Re An Open Letter to Mr Clinton

In article strnlghtC5M2Cv8Hxnetcomcom strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes
   Heres a simple way to convert the Clipper proposal to an unexceptionable
   one Make it voluntary

   That isyou get high quality secure NSA classified technology if you agree
   to escrow your key Otherwise you are on your own

Thats the disturbing part  use of other products IS voluntary for now
and the press releases talk about the White Houses unwillingness to
decide that citizens have a right to good commercial crypto gear
and about how commercial alternatives will be permitted as long as
they provide key escrow services  Thats a clear implication that
theyre considering banning alternatives

Additionally use of real alternatives ISNT totally legal 
youre not allowed to export really good crypto equipment except to
the governments friends eg the Australian government
you can only export even BAD crypto equipment with their permission
and the regulators who control the cellular telephone companies make
sure there are only two competitors so Joes Garage Cellular cant
start offering a secure service  

				Pray for peace      Bill
