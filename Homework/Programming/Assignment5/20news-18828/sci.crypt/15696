   Finally because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in
   realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments
   there will exist strong motivation to record and archive all communications
   in the network for expostfacto scrutiny once some criminal act is
   discovered and the instruments involved have been identified

All is a very big number  The ATT Long Distance network has
around 20000 T3 trunks 45 Mbitsec which is on the order of 1012 bitssec
That doesnt even count the amount of traffic in the LOCAL phone companies
or our longdistance competitors  Its about 200 Exabytes tapes  second
which is pretty large even for the NSA 

On the other hand I can easily see them recording the traffic for
interesting people such as dissidents suspected criminals
foreign telephone calls and anybody noticed using encryption
As Ken Shiriff speculates recording encrypted traffic will probably
be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon
