Subject Re Clipper and Ranting Libertarians

Just a little nitpicking Wasnt it the government that required
a standard railway gauge  Didnt that improve things 

Please dont misunderstand Im utter suspicious of this Clipper
chip Why hold the design TOP SECRET  Was this a work around the
law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the
government is public domain  eg NIH Class Library etc 
DES has its designs published all over the place and it is considered
fairly strong  although could be stronger
