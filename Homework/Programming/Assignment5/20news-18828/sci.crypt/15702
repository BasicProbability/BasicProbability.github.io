note Clintons statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph  I guess
this statement doesent contradict what you said though

 cut here 

        WASHINGTON UPI  The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
start President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
of Police Commisioners convention in Washington
        In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural
Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War would make
everything so far seem so halfhearted that for all practical
purposes this war is only beginning now He repeatedly emphasized
his view that regardless of what has been tried or who has tried
it or how long theyve been trying it this is Day One to me
The audience at the convention whose theme is How do we spell
fiscal relief  FORFEITURE interrupted Clinton frequently
with applause
        Clintons program presented in the speech follows the
outline given in his campaign position papers a cabinetlevel Drug
Czar and boot camps for firsttime youthful offenders  He did
however cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
methods  This years crime bill will have teeth not bare gums
Clinton said  In particular his administration will place strict
controls on data formats and protocols and require the registration
of socalled cryptographic keys in the hope of denying drug
dealers the ability to communicate in secret  Clinton said the
approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
economic activity such as the deficitcausing tax evaders who
live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren
        Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last
November everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
urgency about fighting the drug menace  The advocates of
legalization  the advocates of surrender  may be very good at
making noise Clinton said  But when the American people cast
their ballots it only proved what I knew all along  that the
advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe

Just doing a quick reality check here  is this for real or did someone
invent it to provoke a reaction from people  It sounds more like the
sort of thing youd have heard suitably rephrased from the leader of a 
certain German political party in the 1930s
