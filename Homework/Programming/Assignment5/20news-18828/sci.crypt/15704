Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 144K  I think it is Ive heard its not  Lets
say 8 bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

Its all easy with a DSP The Olivetti Quaderno for example great 1kg
subnotebookpalmtop PC  sorry for the plug folks but Olivetti dont
seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves  includes sound
digitisation hardware they provide vocoders for their DSP which produce
varous bitrates Theres one which gives pretty acceptable voice
quality at 13Kbitsec just right for a V32bis modem

Their DSP can play and record at the same time too  so you wouldnt
need to play twowayradio You can also download code to the DSP
subunit though youd need a software development kit for the DSP in 
question dunno which it is if you wanted to produce your own 
vocoder for say V32 speeds
