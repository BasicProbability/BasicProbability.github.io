Subject Re Facinating facts 30 bit serial number possibly fixed S1 and S2

Hmmm We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial
number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2
is an intentional way of assuring a fail safe for the government 
U is completedly determined given S1 S2 and N 
 
If S1 and S2 do not change even if they remain secret I wonder if
they can somehow be backderived given enough unit keyserial number
pairs 

Maybe 300 such pairs suffice to reconstruct S1 and S2 By such a back
door in the encryption algorithm perhaps it would be possible for  
the manufacturer to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in 
one session This would not btw enable anybody else to retrieve the 
keys in the same way because theyll never get a bunch of 300 NU 
pairs with identical S1 and S2 Note that these have to be constant 
for the whole batch by the very nature of the procedure ie they 
have to be typed in manually by the random number supplying agents

And I was wondering why theyll always do 300 chips in one session  
Since the procedure described by Ms Denning imposes high costs on the 
production of every chip at least three persons for one hour each 
plus the cost of a laptop finally blown to pieces in a spectacular 
Hollywoodlike bonfire add travelling expenses drinks and lighting 
divide the sum by 300 there wont be a larger demand  not from the 
private sector anyway 

And let me mention one other thought that certainly has occurred to all 
the notoriously paranoid people in this group before Who is going to 
verify that no interested party will perform tempest attacks on the 
vault 

Where theres so much smoke and mirrors  there cant be a nice honest 
fire but something really worth hiding
