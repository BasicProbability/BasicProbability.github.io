 Gee Say they feed the 80bit key through Snefru8 and take the first 60
 bits of the result then use those 60 bits as the real key How do you
 figure out that each key is one of 220 equal keys You can try a
 birthday attack but if the key can be changed only once a second then
 you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics

Youre right and I retract the suggestion  Still I wonder  That
there are only 60 bits of key information should in principle be
detectable  Maybe some variant of the tests Rivest et al did to
demonstrate that DES was probably not a group  It should make an
interesting paper  a blackbox analysis of a cryptosystem
