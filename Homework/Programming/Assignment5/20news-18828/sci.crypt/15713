Subject Re Hard drive security for FBI targets

If I forgot doesnt have as much credibility as youd like consider
this alternative  Somewhere on the hard disk duplicated a few times
keep a 128bit random number  When the 128bit digest of your
passphrase is computed it is XORred with the random number before being
used as the key for your hard disk  Writing random junk over the random
numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone

Now if you were merely to claim that you have written random junk
over the XOR key noone would be able to tell whether or not you were
telling the truth  This is a perjury and b vunerable to
rubberhose cryptography but otherwise effective
