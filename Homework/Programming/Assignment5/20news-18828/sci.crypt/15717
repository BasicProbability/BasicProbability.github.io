Subject Overreacting was Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts Ive tossing back and
forth  

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this

The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
In a new Civil War 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and Im worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it  Examine your
history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
or Democratic style governments  I think youll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history

Thats not very good odds  

Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

Lets try to avoid killing things eh  Theres enough blood shed in the
world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars etc

Im probably overreacting  But what Ive read scared me a lot  I dont
want my children growing up in a War Zone
