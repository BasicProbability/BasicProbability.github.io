 First note that the experts will only look at details and of just 
 the algorithm
 
     In addition respected experts from outside the
     government will be offered access to the confidential details of
     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
     their findings
 
 Why not the chip design  Well heres the possiblity  in addition to
 encryption the chip preprocesses voice signals to make them easier
 to analyzetranscribe electronically  The chip once widespread might
 effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for voice
 grepping the US phone network or the criminal  wrongthinking patrons
 thereof

First of all the chip doesnt do that  It runs at 16 megabitssecond
which is far beyond what you need for voice  Its obviously intended
for data as well and on highspeed lines at that

Second  what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone
I dont care how fancy that chip is its not as fancy as the roomful
of analyzers at Fort Meade running the program theyll have 5 years from
now  They cant update every Clipper chip thats out there

Third  if they did do this preprocessing in the chip it would probably
have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns  If
nothing else that would hurt the acceptability of the product  The
V32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly
massaged voice as is add any more to the mix and youre completely out
of the ballpark
