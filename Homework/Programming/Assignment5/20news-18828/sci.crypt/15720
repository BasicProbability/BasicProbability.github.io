Subject S1 S2

  Second question Why Why is such a strange procedure used and not
 a real RNG  This turns those S1S2 in a kind of bottleneck for system
 security

  The only theory that makes any sense is that S1 and S2 are either the
same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers 230 about one billion multiplied by the number
of different S1 S2 combinations
