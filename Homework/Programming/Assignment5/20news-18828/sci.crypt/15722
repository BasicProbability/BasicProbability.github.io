 It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
 would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
 probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained

I think it is unlikely that data like this could be used in court
Currently LEAs can install wiretaps on large numbers of phones record
calls without listening to them and then postfacto obtain warrants
and listen to calls after probable cause is established  But this
strategy wouldnt get the stuff admitted in court  At least not
in the near term

In other words near as I can tell the thing that makes such evidence
inadmissable is the interception without a warrant not the attempt to
interpret what was intercepted without a warrant  Id be surprised
that archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything
but analogous to a wiretap by the courts

Note that that doesnt mean I think it wont be done if technically
feasible  Just as Im sure many wiretaps are done now without
warrants just to fish for avenues to investigate  So in the future
start surveilance start archiving data trump up some probable cause
decrypt postfacto after the warrant is in hand and the investigation
gets a boost from data that sadly wont ever be presented to a jury

While Im posting  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this
archiving scenario to extremes read Lacey and his Friends a
collection of sf stories by David Drake  The US starts down the
slippery slope by archiving everyghing  But dont worry folks its
stored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can
get to it  And by the way well be installing cameras on all major
streets  Hey this is nothing new we already have cameras in banks and
teller machines dont we

And then well pass laws requiring cameras covering all public
places  Then in some private places  Then well make it a crime ever
to be out of range of a camera except in legally licensed privacy
cubicles  Only alone  And with a thorough body search before and
after  But see theres still a right to privacy  We havent
curtailed any rights not really  And just think how much easier itd
be to solve crimes in such a situation just obtain a warrant put on a
VR helmet and take a walk down memory lane

And hey nobodyll be tracking you or me no need to be selfconscious

After all if youre not doing anything illegal

Funny though  While speeding and the radar detector industry became
pretty much a thing of the past somehow all this didnt elminate all
crime in the story  And somehow politicians got exemptions on grounds
of national security and rich corporations got exemptions for their
execs on grounds of industrial espionage and the preservation of
competition  And not everybody was exactly happy with the system  
I cant imagine why
