Seems like sombody didnt like your snooping around Marc

Then it is a good thing we already have this

The csspub mailing list csspabmailgwncslnistgov and address on
 rest of names deleted

Sigh my version of rn asked me whether I really want to send this
posting

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the
Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake  I am the administrator
of csrcncslnistgov alias firstorg  Its a system set up to help out
the needs of FIRST a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams which 
includes a number of worldwide incident response teams such as CERTCC and
other places in Europe  As to the VRFY and EXPN commands they are normally
disabled since early on we didnt want crackers to find out the names of
incident response folks on our mailing lists  We had a disk crash several
months ago which required completely rebuilding the OS files  same old
story our backups werent especially helpful  As you can guess I didnt
remember to redisable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to
find out who was behind clippercsrc  When I saw peoples names posted
here I felt it was time to clear things up  So EXPN and VRFY on csrc have
always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with 
Clipper

I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here
because csrc also provides Usenet service  I posted them from an account
called clipper  I also created an alias called clipper that contains
the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory
Board set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987 and addresses
of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography
security and privacy  I believe that these individuals were included on
this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information
firsthand

The clipper alias is there for the benefit of those named above  It is 
not a source for information it was set up solely to monitor any initial
traffic  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get
traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet

While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this
I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives
of the individuals on the clipper alias  Ive already apologized to them
for whats happened  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common
practice albeit unfriendly to some and any effect of disabling it again
was unintentional
