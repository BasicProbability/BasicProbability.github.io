	just fine to transmit scrambled vocoded voice

Absolutely  I just meant that no secure dedicated crypto device has
ever been given approval  Guerrilla underground devices should be well
possible with todays highspeed modems not that I can think of many v32bis
modems that are approved either mind you  just the overpriced Couriers

Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
digital speech down 144K  I think it is Ive heard its not  Lets
say 8 bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

Reasonably fancy

Standard voice circuits run at 56kbps interexchange in the US
Therefore you need to achieve 41 to get standard voice quality

If youre willing to give up some quality you need only 21  This is still
acceptable from a speech standpoint it will be a little less faithful to
the original but certainly intelligable  Thats all you really need for
this application
