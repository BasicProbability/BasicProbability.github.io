      The algorithm is classified because a military contract or similar
government equivalent to military has been let for this proprietary
design that the Feds say that NSA developed  Is there a patent  Is that
patent publicly available  My betting is that that too is classified

Unless there has been a major change in the law theres no such beast
as a classified patent  Patents exist to encourage communications and
develop the state of the art

	Yes there is the patent can be classified as secret  I recently
	saw a patent from 1947 dealing with nuclear weapons technology
	that was only declassified in the last couple of years  There
	is of course the problem of enforcing the patent

The same thing applies in civilian development you cant patent something
and declare it a trade secret  However you can and should mark all
software including proprietary code unpublished copyright so that it
ever does get exposed you still have some legal protection

	This is absolutely right
