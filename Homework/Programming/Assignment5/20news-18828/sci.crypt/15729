PGP is not available on the archive site rsacom  If it were it
would be highly amusing since rsacom actually Public Key Partners
but its the same entity is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually make use or sell PGP
I believe those patents also apply in Canada but Im not a patent
lawyer or anything

Sorry about double posting but I forgot something

make use or sell in this context have nonstandard meanings

Make means making an encrypted message  Use may mean using PGP or
using an encrypted message  Sell would probably mean selling an
encrypted message  It is the message created by a patented process
incorporated in PGP which infringes
