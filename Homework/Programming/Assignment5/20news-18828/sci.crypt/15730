Subject Re Key Registering Bodies
From arubindsg4dsebeckmancom Arthur Rubin

       Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive
Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch it seems clear that one
of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
Judicial Branch  I suggest the Supreme Court or regionally the
Courts of Appeal  More specifically the offices of their Clerks

Now THAT makes sense  But the other half must be in a nongovernment
escrow  I still like EFF but I admin their security has not been
tested
