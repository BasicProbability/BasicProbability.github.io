 Soviet paranoia right
 
 And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers  And 
 huge Rhombics pointed embassy row  And their sites near
 satellite uplink and downlink sites  Duh

 One case of Slovenian paranoia
 
 Once upon a time a tried to walk over the famous Marathon field not far away 
 from Athens I could not do that mostly becouse the field is now a huge 
 antenna farm Probably a Greek COMINT installation would you agree 

Are you sure that the field is in the area you found the antenna
farm  The tomb Ymvos of Marathon which Herodotus specifies as near
the fighting area is in an area open to the public

You must be referring to the US army base of Nea Makri  It was
built by the US in the same manner as bases all over the world
W Germany Spain Philippines Turkey etc were built  I think
it was a telecommunications hub  Over the recent years US forces
have withdrawn from the base and removed all military equipment  The
area is currently under the control of the Greek Navy until the all
interested parties local goverment central goverment political parties
agree on what should be done with the land park recreation area
realestate

This has nothing to do with cryptography security and the EFF I have
redirected followups to socculturegreek
