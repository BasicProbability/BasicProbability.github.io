I am completely baffled by why Dorothy Denning has chosen
to throw away her academic respectability like this

She hasnt  Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the
professional respect of her colleagues and something won in this
manner is not easily lost  Her support of the clipper  no matter
how unpopular that position may be  serves far more to enhance the
clippers respectability than to diminish her own

I wouldnt think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me
