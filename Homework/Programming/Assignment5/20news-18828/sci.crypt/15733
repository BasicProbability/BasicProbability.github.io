PGP is not available on the archive site rsacom  If it were it
would be highly amusing since rsacom actually Public Key Partners
but its the same entity is the organization holding the patents
which they claim are violated if you actually make use or sell PGP
I believe those patents also apply in Canada but Im not a patent
lawyer or anything

The patents dont apply in Canada  I think the free trade agreement may
provide for recognition of new patents but not old ones
