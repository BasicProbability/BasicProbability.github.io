 the date I have for this is 12693
 
 note Clintons statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph  I guess
 this statement doesent contradict what you said though
 
  cut here 
 
         WASHINGTON UPI  The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh
 start President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation
 of Police Commisioners convention in Washington
         In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural
 Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War would make
 everything so far seem so halfhearted that for all practical
 
 
 I just found out from my source that this article was a joke  Heh heh  
 It seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start  I just didnt
 notice the smiley at the end of the article and there were a few other
 hints which I should of caught

Well isnt this just a hoot   All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt
This just happens to be a case of an ordinaryjoenetter who decided
that he would create andor distribute some misinformation  Ppl buy
into BS posts like this I know because I forwarded a copy of the
post to my office mate who turned around and was although he wont
admit itsorry Joe ready to get in a fight about FORFEITURE
Please if were going to hold our govt which admittedly has had and
still has its problems to high standards then mustnt we follow these
too  Electronic Freedoms only go so far

 
 Anyway  I guess this joke did turn out to resemble Clintons true 
 feelings at least to some extent  
 
 Sorry about that
