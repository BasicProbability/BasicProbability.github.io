At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was des encryped
and the person that had sent it went on vaction  Rather than wait two weeks
I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time  It only took two2
days to crack the file  No I dont have any faith in DES


Taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with much else
that has been published here about brute force DES cracking unless Russell
was lucky with respect to the key Id be very interested in whether the
program Russell used is available In whether he used a cleartext
recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
decryption by hand In whether he used a known plaintext attack

He probably should also tell us given his address what machine he useda
desktop workstation or supercomputer

Depending on his answer this could be an appalling development calling into
question both DES and RSADES Dunno about RSAIDEA

If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single
DES message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that are
messagespecific then heres my Clipper key NSA give me the chip at
once
