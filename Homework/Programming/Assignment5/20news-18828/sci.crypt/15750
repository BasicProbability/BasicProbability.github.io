cascades elided to preserve our sanity

 That wasnt my point My point is that your implied position about the Waco
 Massacre is an assertion cum political position According to a CNN poll

 What you call the Big Brother Chip is right now a proposal under
 discussion and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be
 banned

Just to set the record straight Steve Gardner was not the author of
the bit you quotedI was Steve just took issue with Davids
characterization of my words as pernicious nonsense

I wont further comment on my own viewsfolks either support em or
they dont and the lines in question were neither central to the
points I was making in my original post nor to the important debate
here in scicrypt and elsewhere


Tim May who continues to hold the same views but doesnt feel like
debating politics
