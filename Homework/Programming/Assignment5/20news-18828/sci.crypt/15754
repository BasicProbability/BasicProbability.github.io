 It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
 whole fiasco is the economic standpoint  As others have mentioned the most
 difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one  Lets face it the
 average consumer doesnt care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea  If
 there is a perceived need for cellular encryption then the companies will
 provide one  Most likely a standard will emerge  But if the Clipper is
 too expensive and 25 a chip is way too much then they will develope their
 own or buy a cheaper one  

This is an interesting point  As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb you can
figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods
The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale Products that
sell tens of millions of unitsyear will be at the low end those that sell
thousands of unitsyear will be at the high end  I suspect cellular phones
are in the middle  This implies that adding a 25 chip would increase the
cost of the phone by approx 100 or about 25  30

I dont think youll get a lot of consumer support for this
