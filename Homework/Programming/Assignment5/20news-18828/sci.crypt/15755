No because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations
True theyll blame the wrong guys but nevertheless one cannot say
something like The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship Terminus
when the Feds are listening even if they cannot identify who the
speaker is


Its not a question just of who is holding the phone  Its a question of
what circuit to wiretap in the first place  If two drug dealers are both
using stolen cellular phones the FBI doesnt know which lines to tap
 unless of course theyre tapping all phones maybe all cellular
phones  If they havent tapped the connection ie at least one end of
the connection then they dont know what key to request
