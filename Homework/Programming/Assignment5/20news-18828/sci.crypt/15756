 Numerical Recipes in CFortranPascal  has a nice section on
 encryption and decryption based on the DES algorithm  There is
 also source code provided I think some versions of this book are 
 distributed with the source code on disk the source code can
 also be ordered from the publisher

Yes I benchmarked the DES implementation in the Recipes in C
book it is about 1 12 orders of magnitude SLOWER than the
OuterbridgeKarnGilloglyet al implementation

It may be instructional but it isnt very fast
