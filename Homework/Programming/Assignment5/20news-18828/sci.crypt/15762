Whats the difference between a V32bis modem and a V32bis modem

How fast do the fastest modems go
How far can voice be compressed
Ive seen various assertions about this but anyone with the
straightforward bitspersecond figures will be my friend forever

How about half a friend  The Motorola Codex preliminary VFast modem
which you can by right now does 244 kbps raw over standard phone
lines  288 kbps is what is usually claimed for the final vfast
but you cant go out and buy that right now the standard isnt done yet

Again voice can be compressed quite well down to 4000 or 8000 bps
depending on how good you want it to be but that requires a DSP or a
special ASIC to do in realtime
 
I think I am I think I am  the little engine that philosophized
