I wouldnt think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me

Maybe so but its quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
have no idea whats in Apples patented ROMs Many have modems connected
How do you know all your business secrets arent being stolen Answer
1 Because you trust Apple
2 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy Apples credibility forever

In the Clipper case a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it and well have assurances maybe even from the President that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors While some may not
have confidence in that I am not among them its a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life
