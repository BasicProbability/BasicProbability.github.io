In article C5uprtGMqdcsedacuk pdcdcsedacuk Paul Crowley writes

Perhaps these encryptiononly types would defend the digitized porn if it
was posted encrypted

These issues are not as seperable as you maintain

In fact since effective encryption makes censorship impossible they
are almost the same issue and they certainly fall into the brief of the
EFF


It also falls within the purview of the ACLU but that doesnt mean
the ACLU or the EFF would be the most effective instrument to 
win the hearts and minds in favor of access to cryptography 

Its precisely slogans like cryptography makes censorship impossible
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption  It is not true and in the context of a public debate it
would be a dangerous red herring  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough
