From these figures estimate the number of Clippertap requests the FBI
is expecting  Publish this figure  Compare it on a percapita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected

The Attorney General publishes the number of courtordered taps each year
It isnt enough around a thousand for the average noncrook nonspy to
worry about In fact considering any reasonable guess about the number of
bigtime crooks and spies around it may not be enough even for most crooks
and spies to worry about

Theres no reason to believe that it will go up with Clipper since the
number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption based
on the playbacks weve heard in court cases
