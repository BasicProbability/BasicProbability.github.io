 Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted 
 posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private
 key  For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting a private
 key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
 by a moderator  Minutes followup comments to other participants
 and so on could be posted to the altencrypted group for the use
 of the people who attended Communiques intended by the group for
 nonattendees could of course just be signed using the private key
 but otherwises not encrypted

	I like it  PGP would be useful I guess  Although I dont have
a working version for VMS yet
