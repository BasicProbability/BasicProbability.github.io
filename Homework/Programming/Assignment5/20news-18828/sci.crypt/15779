  Numerical Recipes in CFortranPascal  has a nice section on
  encryption and decryption based on the DES algorithm  There is
  also source code provided I think some versions of this book are 
  distributed with the source code on disk the source code can
  also be ordered from the publisher

 Yes I benchmarked the DES implementation in the Recipes in C
 book it is about 1 12 orders of magnitude SLOWER than the
 OuterbridgeKarnGilloglyet al implementation
 
 It may be instructional but it isnt very fast

It has also apparently been excised from the second edition
