 At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was des encryped
 and the person that had sent it went on vaction  Rather than wait two weeks
 I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time  It only took two2
 days to crack the file  No I dont have any faith in DES
 
 
 Taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with much else
 that has been published here about brute force DES cracking unless Russell
 was lucky with respect to the key Id be very interested in whether the
 program Russell used is available In whether he used a cleartext
 recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
 decryption by hand In whether he used a known plaintext attack

Given that certain archival methods have certain keycleartext in a file I
used a programatic dictionary attack  I used the DES library provided with the
system that I was using  What is to keep anyone from being lucky with a key
 
 He probably should also tell us given his address what machine he useda
 desktop workstation or supercomputer

My previous employment has nothing to do with my current address other than
the fact that the fastest machine in the office was an IBM RISC System6000 
model 530 with 16 meg of memorynot a supercomputer
 
 Depending on his answer this could be an appalling development calling into
 question both DES and RSADES Dunno about RSAIDEA

I really think this more of a statement of the limitations placed on the key
by the interfaceascii charno padding and most programs dont bother to
clear off the archival front and backend IDs

 If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single
 DES message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that are
 messagespecific then heres my Clipper key NSA give me the chip at
 once  

Yes any moderatly bright programmer with a little idle machine time can
crack most of todays real world encryption  I sure that you or I could
select a key and prepare the data inorder that the decryption will become a 
worst case  but that is not the real world and Im sure that is how any 
agency would start an attack on a message as you pointed out there are some 
very good recognition algorithms availible Im just not familiar with them
