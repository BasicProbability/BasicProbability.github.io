   In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
   disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts Ive tossing back and
   forth  

Me too A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in
the sand

   The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
   In a new Civil War 

How many people do you want jailed for their convictions for their
insistence on real privacy Why sit by quietly while the preconditions
for a real civil war are put in place by a shortsighted government

   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and Im worried
   that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
   and paper  

The terminal is mightier than the pen 

   Can people work within the system before trying to break it  Examine your
   history books and find out how many armed revolutions led to Democratic
   or Democratic style governments  I think youll only find one in over
   five thousand years of written history

Really I guess you mean the US revolution How about England
India Mexico France Holland

   Thats not very good odds  

You are misinformed But this whole issue is off the topic

   Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
   used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
   agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

When the cops kick in your door for using PGP tell them that All
were doing here is exercising our socalled rapidly narrowing
right to free speech 

   Im probably overreacting  But what Ive read scared me a lot  I dont
   want my children growing up in a War Zone

Perhaps you should talk to the government about that Or are you a
disciple of David The cops are our FRIENDS Sternlight

The implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto the
notsosubtle subtext of the clipper announcement is what worries me
I dont want my children growing up in a police state
