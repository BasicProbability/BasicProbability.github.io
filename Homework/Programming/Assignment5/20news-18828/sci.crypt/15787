Subject Re Once tapped your code is no good any more

  Maybe so but its quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
 have no idea whats in Apples patented ROMs Many have modems connected
 How do you know all your business secrets arent being stolen Answer
 1 Because you trust Apple
 2 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy Apples credibility forever  

  The reason I could theoretically trust Apple though Im a PC person
myself   is that Apple has to worry about their customers deserting
them if they screw up badly enough  The government doesnt have any such
worry it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants  This
is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient
than government agencies
