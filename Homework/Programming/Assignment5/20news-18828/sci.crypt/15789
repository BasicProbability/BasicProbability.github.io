Really none of this stuff is especially hard All you need for a true
private phone is an ISDN codec a vocoder either a chip or
software an encryptor a chip is fine but software is more than
fast enough a V32 or V32bis modem module and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing Its easy to do its cheap And
any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington just like Qualcomm
did

	Have the feds shut down the people making Sound Blaster What
about Apple and NeXT Apple NeXT Sun and others make systems that
can handle CDquality audio in and out and can perform arbitrary
transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network
or modem

	Perhaps theres a market for a portable vocoder Not a crypto
device simply an RS232voice converter Make it capable of recording
speech and playing it back simultaneously It has applications for
multimedia computing for the handicapped Internet Talk Radio IRC
etc etc etc  It wouldnt be a cryptographic device at all  but I
suppose someone could have it hooked to a 486 laptop with a V32bis
modem and some crypto software Id market the thing with an API for
texttospeech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech
samples And of course Id publish the interface to it so other
folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing
