   Remember that theyve promised to let a committee of outside experts see
   the cryptosystem design

   I hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
   the algorithm through to hardware  While I doubt the NSA would pull
   any monkey business on this point  they have to expect that the
   chip will be reverseengineered sooner or later  its an obvious
   opportunity to introduce additional holes

The chip isnt the place to pull the monkey business  you do it in
the key generation either by having a mathematical backdoor
or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the
keys also save a copy of S1 and S2 and leak it out somehow
or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys
on the chip actually put a different key there VERY hard to detect
since the escrow agents have to either trust the NSA laptop or
give each other the S keys and they still dont know the algorithm
Or have the chipburner at the factory make copies of the keys
Or whatever
