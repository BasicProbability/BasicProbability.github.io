Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security

There are chips which perform the voice compressionexpansion  They cant
be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the
PBX line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses
voicegrade circuits to save the cost of longdistance leased T1s or
satellite circuits

I cant remember the generic term for these chips  My impression is that
this was a big deal 10 years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that
it isnt done much now
