A little perspective might be in order

Right  People here believe the government is listening in on
everything  Sure  If you cant provide an answer change the
assumptions to something you can deal with

Its not a matter of the government listening on on everything its a
matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in
Say if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a
mall the Secret Service decides to go for a warrantless search and
acquires your name  Its a matter of any number of possible wiretap
abuses that cryptology makes far less likely and this chip can
sabotage 

Par for the course though  I predicted that youd be jumping in in
favor of this  The reply was that youd justify anything up to and
including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a
written policy statement  Perhaps a little extreme but not much
