   How fast do the fastest modems go

VFAST is targeted for about 28kbps 144kbps is 500 and 192 may
be here soon too  Remember to ignore compression figures which make
your modem go faster on compressible data because voice gets
compressed better than that and encryption makes further compression impossible

   How far can voice be compressed

The STUIII phones on the market from ATT Motorola and I forget who else
give you a choice of 9600 4800 and 2400 baud  The 9600 and 4800 are CELP
and I think the 2400 is some earlier military vocoder stuff
9600 is decent 2400 is pretty artificial anything less is SpeakSpell
16000 can produce quite adequate sound  Theres also some 8 kbps CELP around
DSPs have made it possible to do all this in real time for cheap

Oldhand government crypto have trouble adjusting to systems faster
than 9600 baud because if the voice on the other end sounds good
you assume the crypto hasnt been turned on yet
