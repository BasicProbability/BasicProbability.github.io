  I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip
and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread Any back
doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme and help grow
the market demand for a secure alternative


There are companies one in Canada as I recall which specialize in
analyzing chips to understand process technology design rules
 to understand the probable yield of the assembly line making them
and therefore the probable current cost and possible future cost curves
given design shrinks statistical quality control  better yields etc

Taiwanese Japanese and especially Korean semiconductor manufacturers
have all korea continues reverseengineered foreign chips and
produced the chip  Taiwan and Japan have signed intellectual
property treaties and now at least extract the gatetransitor level
design before laying the chip out again  The koreans still
use masklevel copying I believe  At least they are under a lot
of pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property
standards

All this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs  There are lots
of techniques to do so in both hardware and software design

For a complex chip there will be real intellectual effort extracting
the gate design from the transistor design and the algorithm from
the gate design  But it wont take two smart guys even 6 months working
40 hour weeks  Koreans work 60 or more 8
