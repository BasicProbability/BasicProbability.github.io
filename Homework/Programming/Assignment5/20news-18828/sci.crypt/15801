Subject Re Ideas on Clipper

I was annoyed to find that this guy posted my private email response to
him but since I believe what I said Ill defend it anyway

 Theyre betting that you cant cryptanalyze E to get U given N
   But we cant
 do this right now with DES even knowing the encryption method without
 doing almost the whole 56bit search

That is not true with chosen plaintext attacks DES keys can be determined
without the full search

By almost I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack  The chosen
plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 236 chosen plaintexts
drawn from a total of about 247 that need to be run if I understand the
situation correctly  This is certainly a break under the meaning of the
Act but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch

The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack
encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and
observe the results  I wish him joy of it and choose not to try that attack

I am not defending the system and in fact am offended by the ideas of
escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard
However I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons since that
weakens the case against it

I said in my private email
 Its not clear that the experts will be told F  In fact Id be surprised
 Id expect something more of the form of the FIPS pub describing DES so that
 they could look at the algorithm in general rather than with the specific
 set of keys chosen

Oh come on thats like saying you could evaluate DES without the Sbox
constants

No its quite different  The government would have no percentage in
choosing F to be a weak key since its not to their advantage to have
anybody else know it  The experts could thus assume that F is no worse
than anything else during their analysis  Totally different situation
from unknown Sboxes  Again Im not saying it would be good or
satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without
the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and
so on  simply that I doubt that they would be given all the
information
