For example a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer
be private from Big Brother eavesdropping

Now almost 100 years later we have the right words for the problem here

Phone calls are virtual visits  Those experienced in virtual reality
would know from that title that phone calls need to have all the properties
of a walk in the park with your friend  security from casual overhearing
and easy verification to see if anyone is listening secretively  As designed
they fail at that

trouble is telephones were invented a long time ago and people didnt
realize the danger or the concept of virtual reality back then
