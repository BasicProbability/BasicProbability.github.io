Remember in the
announcement they described this scheme as balancing the two
extremes of having no privacy and claiming that citizens had a
Constitutional right to encryption  

So much for Clintons support of the right of privacy

Theres an out for him  The announcement talked about strong cryptography
I believe  Specifically

	nor is the US saying that every
     American as a matter of right is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product

Every vendor claims his product is unbreakable  so this was sloppy wording

I am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the NSAs
best secret algorithms  I dont want any NSA algorithms actually

Ill let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms  and RSAs

All I want is what I have already  the ability and right to invent and use
my own algorithms share them with my friends and sell them
