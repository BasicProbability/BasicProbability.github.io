Subject Info on Mathematics of Encryption Wanted

I just signed up for this group so I hope Im not missing something
in a FAQ but Im looking for a good introduction to the mathematics
of encryption  particularly DES and PublicKey though others would
be interesting also  Probably a good library could help me out but I
thought it might be even easier if I could obtain a nice article
entirely electronically besides I have this rather rational phobia
of libraries for reasons stemming from this dissertation thing
hanging over my head   
	I have a basic knowledge of mathematics numbertheory is a
bit unfamiliar to me but Ive had a few graduatelevel math courses
in some other areas anyway Im not a complete novice to the field
So probably something aimed at a basic graduate introductory level
would be about right  Something anyway which is more specific than
a really big prime number is generated to code the message
	If someone knows of a good text available by ftp or gopher
or would like to email me one please let me know  Ill probably keep
reading this group but it would be nice if you would email me at the
same time so I dont miss it

Thanx Lulu
