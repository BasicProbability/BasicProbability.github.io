If you can get it for a buck 2nd hand it must be true eh Im pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to among many other things provide highquality
cryptosystems to a variety of places I dont recall reading anywhere
reliable that theyre supposed to

	1 Monitor my phonecalls
	2 Monitor usenet
	3 Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack
	4 etc etc

	This is not to say that they dont they might But you dont
know that they do and you have no evidence that they do for almost
all values of you It follows therefore that for most values of you
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia

OK Andrew Ill provide some evidence A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a westcoast office They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese One day the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices The Japanese had simply intercepted it So my friend the computer
systems admin came up with a solution He started sending the data out
doubleblockencrypted with DES 

Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents They told him to
knock it off The president gave in since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government

Now if the government wasnt monitoring the communications how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed Further since encryp
tion isnt illegal and DES certainly isnt what is the basis of the
governments ceaseanddesist demand

The spooks do whatever they think is necessary with or without the blessings
of the law Ill say no thanks to Clipper or anything else the government
produces For the moment double or triple DES is probably adequate And when
the line is idle send random garbage just to keep em busy
