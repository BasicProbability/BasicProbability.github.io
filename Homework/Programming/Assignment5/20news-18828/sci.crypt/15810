In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts Ive tossing back and
forth  

Somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this

The reason is very simple  How many people do you want to die in a riot 
In a new Civil War 

Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and Im worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper  

Can people work within the system before trying to break it

A circut court judge in Illinois once said When dealing with a government
that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its citizenry
one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means
to parry this attack on personal privacy

Unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
detectors

The point remains  More and more I see the government slowly washing
away privacy  Even unwittingly  Do you think I will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth  Do you think I
will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what Im saying  Even if there is no evidence of my
guilt  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its citizenry without recourse of any kind  Im tired
of it  There is IMHO no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy

More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press
releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public and I am sickened  I am revolted  I am repulsed

90 perhaps even 95 of this country could care less about the
clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration

This saddens and frightens me

I am a conserveative believe it or not  A law and order conserveative
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people  Tell them its going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you
put cameras in their home

Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves

Somebody once said something like Armed Violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack  It is not meant to be used in
agression  This is the difference between selfdefence and murder

To be quite honest the way things are going Id call it self defense

Lets try to avoid killing things eh  Theres enough blood shed in the
world without adding a couple of riots Civil Wars etc

Im probably overreacting  But what Ive read scared me a lot  I dont
want my children growing up in a War Zone


And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
