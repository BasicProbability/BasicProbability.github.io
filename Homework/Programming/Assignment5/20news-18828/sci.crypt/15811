               WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COSTEFFECTIVE

   SUMMARY Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars
   wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police  So the
   proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part 
   in three thousand to be costeffective 

Robins calculation is interesting and important even if its off by
an order of magnitude for example

Even if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO the
protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much
higher than the 1 part in 3 thousandit depends on the exact details
of the phone call length protocol etc shorter calls get a
proportionately greater hit

However I suspect most Americans will not find this line of reasoning
as persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to ones house
are
