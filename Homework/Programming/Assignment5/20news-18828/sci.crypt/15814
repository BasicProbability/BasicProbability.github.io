Subject Re Clipper considered harmful

 
   The clipper chips User key is formed by
 
           R1  EDEN1S1S2S1
           R2  EDEN2S1S2S1
           R3  EDEN3S1S2S1
 
   Why is the tripleencrytion used  Is it just to gain an effective
increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch  If so why use
80 bit keys  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm its
not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
guess S1S2
 
   Why are N1 N2 and N3 formed as they are  It would be facinating to
see the Skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require
three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way
 
   Where do the 34bit constant values that are concatenated with the
serial number to form N1N2N3 come from  Are they changed from chip to
chip or session to session  Even if theyre published in the NY Times
if SkipJack is resistant to knownplaintext attacks when using triple
encryption then theres no break in security  But why allow that kind
of weird format  If those three 34bit values are trulyrandom bits then
maybe its used to ensure that a knownplaintext attack on SkipJack if
it exists cant be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production
run of these chips
 
   Does Dorothy Denning read this group  If not is someone on the group
forwarding questions like these to her or Martin Hellman or anyone else
whos seen more details about the chip
