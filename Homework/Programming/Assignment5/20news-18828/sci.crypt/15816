Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital
cellular phones They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
had the capacity The government decided to discourage them

Youre blowing smoke  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice lucrative overseas
markets like Japan and the EC  The government told them dont do encryption
if you ever hope to export this technology  The reason that CDMA doesnt
have encryption is NOT because the Gmen came aknocking at Qualcomms door
Its because Qualcomm doesnt think that the US market for digital cellular
is big enough for them  This is just the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations all over again

If you dont believe me call Qualcomm and ASK THEM  Dont just throw
out conspicracy theories  At least dont do it on scicryptthere are
whole other newsgroups devoted to this kind of uninformed claptrap

any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from Washington just like Qualcomm
did I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their
products are too expensive

Hah  Theyre not that much more expensive  Besides if a drug dealer
can afford a Rolex and a Mercedes he can darn well afford Cylink phones
No Cylink sells their phones because theyre willing to make different
stuff for domestic use vs export  Qualcomm isnt  So Cylink makes
moneythats capitalism comrade

Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this Better yet
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a
sound card into a secure phone

Someone this and someone that  If you think its so easy why are
you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing
it  Your name would become known and loved by dozens  But no that would
require actual EFFORT
