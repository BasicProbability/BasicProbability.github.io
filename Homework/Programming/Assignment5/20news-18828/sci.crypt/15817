Subject Crypto papers on the net

   Ive recently been reading a paper of Merkles publixhed only on the
net I think discussing three potential replacements for DES  Was
anyting ever done with these  Are Khufu Khafre andor Snefru still
being discussed anywhere  I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA
FAQ and I think it may also be in the scicrypt FAQ
   On a related topic can anyone point me toward good sites to find
papersarticlesdiscussions of cryptology  I think Ive about exhausted
the MathSci library here which doesnt seem to have anything more recent
than about 84
 
   Thanks
