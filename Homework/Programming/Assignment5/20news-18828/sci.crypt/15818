Subject PGP ideas for IBM systems

   Ive been thinking about how difficult it would be to make PGP available
in some form on EBCDIC machines  The message authentication would be ugly
but I think at least the IDEA encryption could work if PGP had a switch
to tell it to use IDEA in OFBmode or ECBmode  In OFBmode errors in
translating EBCDICASCIIEBCDIC would only affect their byte not the
16 bytes that would be affected under CBC
   Is PGP set up to use different IDEA modes  I dont recall notincing it
in the executable but I havent gone through it as carefully as I probably
should
