 At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was des encryped
 and the person that had sent it went on vaction  Rather than wait two weeks
 I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time  It only took two2
 days to crack the file  No I dont have any faith in DES
 
 
 Taking this at face value though it seems quite dissonant with much else
 that has been published here about brute force DES cracking unless Russell
 was lucky with respect to the key Id be very interested in whether the
 program Russell used is available In whether he used a cleartext
 recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
 decryption by hand In whether he used a known plaintext attack
 
 He probably should also tell us given his address what machine he useda
 desktop workstation or supercomputer
 
 Depending on his answer this could be an appalling development calling into
 question both DES and RSADES Dunno about RSAIDEA
 
 If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single
 DES message in a couple of days assuming no tricks that are
 messagespecific then heres my Clipper key NSA give me the chip at
 once

 David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of
                          our information errors and omissions excepted  
 
 

A person I know belonging to a research lab of a rivate
company claimed to me during a priavte conversation that given the
equipment in his lab he could crack a Kerberos ticket in 15 minutes to
an hour He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an
extraordinare kind I believe The attack was possible because of the
amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small
message This was two years ago
DES is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data For a
lot of purposes however it is still very adequate
