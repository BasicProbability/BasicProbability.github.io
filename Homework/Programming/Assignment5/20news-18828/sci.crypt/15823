Note that measures to protect yourself from
TEMPEST surveillance are still classified as far as I know

I think this to be inaccurate One can buy TEMPEST equipment commercially
Even Macs

Sure you can buy a TEMPEST approved Mac  if you have enough
money  I havent had any reason to look at this type of pricing
for about 10 years but a TEMPEST rating in 1982 would raise the
price of a 249500 Radio Shack Model III to something around
1500000

Or just dig a deep enough hole in the ground 50 feet should do it
