If you can get it for a buck 2nd hand it must be true eh Im pretty
sure the NSA is supposed to among many other things provide highquality
cryptosystems to a variety of places I dont recall reading anywhere
reliable that theyre supposed to

	1 Monitor my phonecalls
	2 Monitor usenet
	3 Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack
	4 etc etc

	This is not to say that they dont they might But you dont
know that they do and you have no evidence that they do for almost
all values of you It follows therefore that for most values of you
your claims about the NSA border on paranoia

OK Andrew Ill provide some evidence A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a westcoast office They routinely sold
story deleted

Let me give you another story that actually happened to ME  We sell
communications boards that use a 68000  They used to be high tech Our
agent in the UK sold a system to a company in CH which packaged it in a
product for CZ LondonBernPrague  I telexed the Brits and told them
the Swiss need to pass export paperwork through the US as at the time
you needed an export lisence for these systems

Now I knew the NSA was watching this traffic just like they are watching
THIS traffic

And what do you know two weeks later an agent of the US government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the Evil
Empire we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly

He was part of a FIVE man office in COLUMBUS OHIO who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal I assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isnt
that much stuff coming out of Columbus 

Wow the electric utility in Prague sure is a big worry for these folks 

The point is we have created a giant bureaucracy NSA with a budget
bigger than the CIAs who like all bureaucracies fill their time looking
for things to do  The Evil Empire is gone  The NSA is not  They will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets  I just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass but that is too
much to hope for they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like Dorothy Denning  Sigh
