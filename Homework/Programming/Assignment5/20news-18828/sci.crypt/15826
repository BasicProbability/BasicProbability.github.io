Someone in Canada asked me to send him some public domain DES file
encryption code I have  Is it legal for me to send it

I believe its legal to send DES code or equipment from the US to Canada
with no export license  I think this is the only place you can do this  all
other countries require a license

As an aside Ive always thought it should be legal to send DES software
anywhere if you follow these rules

   1  Encrypt your DES software with DES
   2  Send the encrypted software to the recipient
   3  Send the key to the recipient

The only way the person on the other end can use your DES software is if
heshe already has DES available  otherwise they cant decrypt your
program and it is useless  If youve guaranteed they already have DES
have you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of
your program  Im sure its still illegal but it seems like a good idea
