Subject Does Rush read his Email

	Send something to Rush Linbaugh about Clinton taking away our right
to privacy and how if the govt standard takes off only people with lots
of money drug dealers will be able to justify DES stuff  He will slam
Clinton for this on the air

I seem to recall Rush saying that he has a CompuServe account  If anyone
wants to Email him all we need is his account number ie 123456789
and then we could email him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma
like so 123456789compuservecom  THIS IS NOT HIS ADDRESS

So does anyone know his email address  He says he uses it all the time
I wonder if he reads altfanrushlimbaugh   His ego is big enough
