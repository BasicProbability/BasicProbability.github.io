        Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive
  Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch it seems clear that one
  of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
  Judicial Branch  I suggest the Supreme Court or regionally the
  Courts of Appeal  More specifically the offices of their Clerks
 
 Now THAT makes sense  But the other half must be in a nongovernment
 escrow

Good idea But why put all the eggs in one basket

Given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks why
not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to
be guarded better than Fort Knox

Give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping The USA has over 10000
banks and thrifts  there are not likely to be more than 2000000 Clipper
phones sold
