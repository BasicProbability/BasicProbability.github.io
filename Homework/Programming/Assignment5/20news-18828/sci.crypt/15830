 Additonally I spoke with Mr Melnick about their algorithm He couldnt tell
 me much about their new agorithm because it hasnt been patented yet

 Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
 of business This is a very real possibility So they really need help in
 stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard

If theyre planning on patenting an algorithm then I hope they go out of
business as quickly as possible  And you can tell them I said that

Im sure many other readers of these newsgroups will agree too
