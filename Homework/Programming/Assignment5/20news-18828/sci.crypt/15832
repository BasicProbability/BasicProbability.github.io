OK Andrew Ill provide some evidence A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a westcoast office They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese One day the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices The Japanese had simply intercepted it So my friend the computer
systems admin came up with a solution He started sending the data out
doubleblockencrypted with DES 

Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents They told him to
knock it off The president gave in since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government

Now if the government wasnt monitoring the communications how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed Further since encryp
tion isnt illegal and DES certainly isnt what is the basis of the
governments ceaseanddesist demand

Something similar has happened to me  ages ago when we were working on PGP
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test 
new features around  Now at this time PGP and certainly the newer version
was unknown over here  Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received
a request that I stop sending encrypted email  Now there is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this since they wouldnt have
known about PGP  they must have checked for unknown data types in the
message tried to unscramble it found they couldnt get past the PEM
armour part and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop  Luckily
the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their
networks 

In case people think email scanning doesnt take place I can assure you
that it is done regularly by many sites  usually not by government
agencies or at least not that I know of but by local administrators who
for reasons of their own have decided to monitor all communications
Im sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons  stop hackers
terroristschild pornographersdrug dealersevil commieswhatever  There
have been several occasions when Ive got people into trouble simply by
including the traditional NSA bait in a message I dont try it any more
now   A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of
the UK town of Scunthorpe hint look for words embedded in it  Im sure
there are many more examples of this happening in fact if anyone has any
examples Id appreciate hearing from them  I could use them as
ammunition during talks on privacy issues
