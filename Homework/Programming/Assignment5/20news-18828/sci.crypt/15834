   In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
   disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts Ive tossing back and
   forth  

Me too A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in
the sand

I never advocated hiding in the sand  Im advocating a peaceful
solution while a peaceful solution is possible  Unless you want blood on
your hands

How many people do you want jailed for their convictions for their
insistence on real privacy Why sit by quietly while the preconditions
for a real civil war are put in place by a shortsighted government

Read the above

   Everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it and Im worried
   that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
   and paper  

The terminal is mightier than the pen 

I type corrected  

Really I guess you mean the US revolution How about England
India Mexico France Holland

English revolution what revolution  They never had one  
India If they could get around their religion restrictions
Mexico Point Taken I forgot about this one  
France Napoleon Bonepart would have something to say about this
Holland I didnt know they had one wont comment because I dont know
enough

   Thats not very good odds  

You are misinformed But this whole issue is off the topic

Actually I consider the issue on topic  When you start gambling with
fire crackers sooner or later somebody is going to lose a hand

When the cops kick in your door for using PGP tell them that All
were doing here is exercising our socalled rapidly narrowing
right to free speech 

Fine  Exercise the right to free speech  Thats great  But dont resort
to armed violence until theres no other possibility

Perhaps you should talk to the government about that Or are you a
disciple of David The cops are our FRIENDS Sternlight

No  I believe there are bad cops and good cops  There are bad people
and good people  And all that grey inbetween  

I have had the pleasure of knowing a police officer who did his best to
uphold the laws he swore to defend  I have also seen what happens when
police power is abused

Dont generalize in either direction  It just causes problems

The implied threat of the illegalization of private crypto the
notsosubtle subtext of the clipper announcement is what worries me
I dont want my children growing up in a police state

Me either  Nice can of worms aint it
