The point remains  More and more I see the government slowly washing
away privacy  Even unwittingly  Do you think I will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth  Do you think I
will live in a soceity that insists I register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what Im saying  Even if there is no evidence of my
guilt  Do you think I will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its citizenry without recourse of any kind  Im tired
of it  There is IMHO no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy

More than the proposals themselves I read the language of the press
releases the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public and I am sickened  I am revolted  I am repulsed

90 perhaps even 95 of this country could care less about the
clipper chip the wiretap bill the smart card because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the Clinton Administration

This saddens and frightens me

I am a conserveative believe it or not  A law and order conserveative
But the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me
mostly because I know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the American people  Tell them its going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists and they will let you
put cameras in their home

Even in the wake of Waco you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves

To be quite honest the way things are going Id call it self defense

And I dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
24 hours a day

I never advocated not saying what you believe in  Im advocating second
thought and calm  

A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield
A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield
The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield

Think about it
