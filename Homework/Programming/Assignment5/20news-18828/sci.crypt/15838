Advances in digital computing have made it possible for ordinary people to
use powerful machine cipher techniques

It is tempting albeit chauvinistic to believe that we have a new situation
here thanks to our pet computers  This is not true  David Kahns The
Codebreakers a history of cryptography makes two things obvious

1	Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
	and has been going on for thousands of years  Teenage slang and
	cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
	creation

2	The systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as and
	sometimes more secure than those used by military and diplomatic
	users of that time although they seem very simple and insecure
	today eg In places the Bible used a more complex simple
	substitution than Caesar did for his military dispatches but before
	Caesar

I commend Kahns book to all who might be interested
