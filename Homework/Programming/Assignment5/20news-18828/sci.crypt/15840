BTW Im working on one

You should realize that form letters are the worst way to influence
your congresscritters exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest
rung of the opinion ladder

If you want to write and I think you should take the time to really
write a letter  Things to emphasize

	 Its been said that Usenet is available to the technical
	  elite ie the techies at corporate sites and universi
	  ties  Emphasize that you are part of the group that will
	  be makingdevelopingusing Clintons data superhighway

	 Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing
	  and data communications if this is the case dont call your
	  self an expert after wiring in a 1200 bps modem   This
	  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers  Dont
	  turn it into braggadocio just tell them that you know the
	  technical sides of the issue

	 Dont overdo jargon and gobbledygook  Remember your letter
	  will be first read in all likelihood by a staffer who may
	  even be a college student if they dont understand it your
	  views wont even make the running total sheets

	 Be concise dont ramble  Rants are definitely out of place
	  Cite references if necessary but only use accepted references
	  like academic journals  My neighbor Jim is not a real refer
	  ence  8

	 Unfortunately very few Congresscritters really understand
	  electronic communications  Encourage them to pick up access
	  to Compuserve America Online or one of the FreeNets  Offer
	  to send them samples  If you are in a position to do so offer
	  them or their staffers back in the home state access to your
	  systems  Offer to give a demonstration the next time theyre in
	  town  Your offer to get personally involved in helping them
	  will give your opinions more credence

	 In addition to sending mail to your representatives send mail
	  to the members of the committee or subcommittee that is dealing
	  with the issue  If your Congresscritter isnt on the committee
	  they cant be of much help until the matter comes to the floor

Wes

ps Id suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the
    more traditional media but Usenet doesnt have a decent track record
    in the analogy department  8
