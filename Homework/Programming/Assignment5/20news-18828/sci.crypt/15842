I seem to recall Rush saying that he has a CompuServe account  If anyone
wants to Email him all we need is his account number ie 123456789
and then we could email him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma
like so 123456789compuservecom  THIS IS NOT HIS ADDRESS

So does anyone know his email address  He says he uses it all the time
I wonder if he reads altfanrushlimbaugh   His ego is big enough
