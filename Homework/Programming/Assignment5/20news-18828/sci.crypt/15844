Subject Re Does Rush read his Email

	Send something to Rush Linbaugh about Clinton taking away our right
to privacy and how if the govt standard takes off only people with lots
of money drug dealers will be able to justify DES stuff  He will slam
Clinton for this on the air

Hell slam Clinton for anything at all on the air  I just do not
understand why he remains so popular  Hell take a piece of video of
Clinton walking along find a frame in which Clinton wrinkles his
nose say freeze on it and blow it up full screen and then rant for
five minutes on how no one could possibly trust someone with such a
face and such beady greedy little eyes  Ive seen this on his TV show
it was around the time of the inauguration  Can anyone call this
stuff legitimate I hate to say informed commentary  How can
anyone with half a brain in his or her head1 continue to watch
it2

The American TVwatching and I guess radiolistening public never
ceases to amaze me

1 Oops have I just inadvertently answered my own question

2 I myself only see it when I run across it every couple months when
    channelsurfing late at night the longest Ive been able to stand
    him was about 10 minutes

Apologies for stripping the altfanrush groups from the Newsgroups
line the software here apparently rejects anything with groups we
dont carry and we dont carry those  Also I removed scicrypt from
followups
