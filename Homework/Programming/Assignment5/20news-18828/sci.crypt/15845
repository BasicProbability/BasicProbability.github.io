1  Second Amendment gives us the right to keep and bear arms

2  Strong cryptography is arms according to the US government thats
    why its so hard to export

Therefore we have a constituitional right to strong cryptography  


Better I think is our right peacably to assemble  I have a right to meet
you in a park and talk privately  I have a right to see if anyone is
nearby listening

In cyberspace cryptography gives us a right to assemble with control over
who overhears us
