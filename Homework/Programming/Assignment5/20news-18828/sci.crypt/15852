The NRA is successful because among a number of things on the drop of
a hat they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards
faxes and phone calls  Certainly with our waycool Internet powers of

I dont know about you but I have nearly forgotten how to generate paper

a complicated job for those of us hooked on our waycool Internet
