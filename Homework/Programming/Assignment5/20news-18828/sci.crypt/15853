 A person I know belonging to a research lab of a rivate
 company claimed to me during a priavte conversation that given the
 equipment in his lab he could crack a Kerberos ticket in 15 minutes to
 an hour He had access to rather powerful DES hardware but not of an
 extraordinare kind I believe The attack was possible because of the
 amount of known plaintext in the ticket which itself constitutes a small
 message This was two years ago
 DES is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data For a
 lot of purposes however it is still very adequate

This sounds an awful lot like a passwordguesser not a weakness in
DES  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper
that came out about 25 years ago in both Computer Communications
Review and Usenix  For that matter it was loudly discussed on the
Kerberos mailing list even earlier

The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES and everything to do
with bad password selection

Im perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks
possible on DES  Im quite dubious that private research labs know
them  And the parameters of a bruteforce attack are quite well
established see for example the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the
July 91 Cryptologia  Youre not going to do it in an hour with only
rather powerful DES hardware  Ill leave the arithmetic as an
exercise for the reader  On average youll need to do 255 trials
Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs and for
how many such engines are used
