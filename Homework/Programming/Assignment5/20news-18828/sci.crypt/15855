The NRA is successful because among a number of things on the drop of
a hat they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards
faxes and phone calls  Certainly with our waycool Internet powers of
organization we can act in the same way if such action is appropriate

I dont know about you but I have nearly forgotten how to generate paper
mail

If I had email to Congress I would have written many letters by now
I havent written one yet as it turns out  Writing on paper is such
a complicated job for those of us hooked on our waycool Internet

Thats what MCI Mail is for  CompuServe also has CongressGrams TM

This is not intended as an advertisement that really is what MCI Mail WAS
intended for according to their ads
