Gasp

Ive just spent 3 hours catching up on scicrypt here slow reader I
guess and I really have to put out a few comments too  First let me
flame the famous Dave S  Hes obviously only 10 years old  Cut him
some slack 

The joke about Clintoncryptodrugs slammed me thru the roof  Nice job
guys  Ive been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years
now Clintons actions so far have really helped  But because of
government action taken against various other groups I have developed
a 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list
The Sboxes are the critical component and since I chose 32 out of 57
based on the key cracking this DES is going to tough  The reason it
slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a
different set of sboxes I know its only a vector but it sure makes
random search a pain  Several marijuana legalization groups have had
their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug
usesales  Its not a crime to be a member of a legalization org
but you will be watched

It really is important to write a letter to every official you
personally vote for to explain why your privacy is being destroyed by
the cripple chip  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get
enough mail  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real and
the IMI Illinois Marijuana Initiative has grown to the point where we
are seeing some changes

Its pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the
implimentation decision being made behind our backs  As Vesselin
points out this was common practice in communist regimes and may be
again depending on how the vote goes  But just as criminals have guns
and law abiding citizens dont and criminals like me have marijuana
and law abiding subjects dont criminals like me will have secure
crypto while law abiding robots dont  PGP is nice but as time goes
on we all can do better  And to save our hides we will

Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli  Hes my favorite dude
500 years ago he saw clearly how people are and tried to explain
that to princes who wanted people to obey  One section not quoted
Ive got The Prince at home so Ill just paraphrase   had to do
with conquring a free city  The only way is to completly destroy
it  Failing that you must appoint locals to high positions and accept
the peoples customs  Even after 100 years of oppression a people
will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive
government  And he gave an example  And that was 300 years before
Thomas Jefferson

There were questions about watching traffic  Only interesting traffic
is watched stuff that goes overseas and comes back stuff with keywords
like marijauana cryptography NSA  certain individuals who are known
subversives etc  It is easy enough to store all that traffic  So if
you know how to be subversive ie how to be unseen its pretty easy
to go unnoticed for a long time  The stronger your crypto system and the
less youre noticed the better your chances of developing an organization
which can diseminate truth to the masses

Which gets me to the thread about a public encrypted conference
Thats just silly  The first thing the feds do is send in an
infiltrator like Dave S and they know what youre doing  It will be
fun for teenagers and college students but for the real world its
pretty pointless  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where
you get your marijuana

Guns drugs and crypto do have some commonality there are people in
government who want you to obey their rules  As Lundquist says in
altdrugs Live free or dont  Machiavelli pointed out thats just
how most people actually live inspite of appearences to the contrary
Its true that the decision to shove the clipper not the same thing as
Intergraphs down our throats violates the principles of what the
US was founded on but the government is full of idiotic robots
called bureaucrats and theres less to worry about than one might
think  Only really innocent read naive subjects of the US will be
hurt by this the rest of us criminals will live in secure freedom
de Toqueville pointed out 150 years ago that the tyranny of the
majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government

And given what I see government officials doing where I work Argonne
National Lab the level of stupidity makes Dave S look smart
