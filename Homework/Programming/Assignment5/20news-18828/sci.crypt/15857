   I wouldnt think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
   unsound to me

   Maybe so but its quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
   have no idea whats in Apples patented ROMs Many have modems connected
   How do you know all your business secrets arent being stolen Answer
   1 Because you trust Apple
   2 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
   destroy Apples credibility forever

Then theres also
3 Because its NOT SECRET  If I want to I CAN go look at Apples
copyrighted ROMs in a Mac so theyre not keeping any secrets  
You dont even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope
you just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it means
Motorola object code isnt all that obscure  
Yes its copyrighted so I cant go selling copies or using the copy myself
but I CAN see it and disassemble it

4 Theyre not asking me to trust their honesty  Theyre asking me to
trust the quality of their assembly language programming 
but I can see for myself what the performance price and crashesday are
NSA an organization not known for its honesty or openness 
is asking me to trust them with my privacy but they wont trust me  Feh
