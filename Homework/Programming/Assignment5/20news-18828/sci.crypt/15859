Subject Re Screw the people crypto is for hardcore hackers  spooks  only

   In article 1993Apr2222390625929lehmancom pmetzgersnarkshearsoncom Perry E Metzger writes
   Qualcomm had spare cycles in the DSPs for their new CDMA digital
   cellular phones They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
   had the capacity The government decided to discourage them

   Youre blowing smoke  Qualcomm wants to sell to nice lucrative overseas
   markets like Japan and the EC  The government told them dont do encryption
   if you ever hope to export this technology  The reason that CDMA doesnt
   have encryption is NOT because the Gmen came aknocking at Qualcomms door
   Its because Qualcomm doesnt think that the US market for digital cellular
   is big enough for them  This is just the International Traffic in Arms
   Regulations all over again

Perry has already stated on the net that Qualcomm wanted to sell overseas and
the government told them they wouldnt be allowed to export
so hes only blowing the same smoke you are 
Sure they probably could have made a US version and a noncrypto
export version and contracted with a Bulgarian or Japanese software house to
develop an overseas crypto ROM but thats getting pretty expensive

   No Cylink sells their phones because theyre willing to make different
   stuff for domestic use vs export  Qualcomm isnt  So Cylink makes
   moneythats capitalism comrade

Well some people like capitalism and others prefer free enterprise
theyre different  Using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist

   Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this Better yet
   prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a
   sound card into a secure phone
   Someone this and someone that  If you think its so easy why are
   you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it

Writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do
writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill
Developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized
but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you dont
have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff
Once the 586Pentium becomes widespread or the next generation of
sound boards has DSPs on it I suspect well see it happen
Maybe the vanilla 486Soundblaster is enough

				Pray for peace      Bill
