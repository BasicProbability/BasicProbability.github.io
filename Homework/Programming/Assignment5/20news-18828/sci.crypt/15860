   Doug Holland claims Tom Clancy has provided the recipe for nuclear bombs
   Clancy himself says he has omitted certain crucial steps Further how do we
   know Clancy knows rather than repeating what hes read or been told in the
   unclassified domain

On the other hand when John Aristotle Phillips was a junior at Princeton
trying to keep from flunking physics by doing a terrific term paper
his atom bomb design was good enough that it got classified
A few of the steps were derived from social engineering 
eg the name of the explosive but it was fundamentally sound and DID get an A
The Pakistan embassy also called him up trying to get a copy
at the time they were lobbying the US government to get some nuclear
reactors for purely nonmilitary electrical power generation
