Subject Re Organized Lobbying for Cryptography

In article hcstransferstratuscom cmeellisunswstratuscom Carl Ellison writes

To paraphrase I may not agree with what youre encrypting but I defend
your right to encrypt it


Great slogan  Im ready to sign up with a cryptolobbying effort though
I wouldnt want to do it through an NRA offshoot  Shall we also push
for the CRA   Cryptographic Rights Amendment
