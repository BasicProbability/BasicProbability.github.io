Subject Lets build software cryptophones for over the internet

Well after a lot of trawling through archives I found the post
I reproduce in full below  Is it time to get together to develop
a tcpip standard for crypto voice that we could then layer on
pointtopoint SLIP as the free standard for crypto voice like
pgp is for mail

PS Note the date of this post  Appropriate huh

The techniques for production systems revolve around Code Excited Linear
Prediction CELP algorithms which capture 20 ms or so of speech and
attempt to match the speech with a combination of signals from a
codebook choosing the combination which minimizes the error

In case youd like to experiment with CELP you can obtain a software
implementation of the 4800 bps Fed Std CELP coder for free

The US DoDs FederalStandard1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
prediction voice coder version 32 CELP 32 Fortran and C simulation source
codes are now available for worldwide distribution at no charge on DOS
diskettes but configured to compile on Sun SPARC stations from

In addition to the source codes example input and processed speech files
are included along with a technical information bulletin to assist in
implementation of FS1016 CELP  An anonymous ftp site is being considered
for future releases
