Discussion will range from the usual general topics such as the

specific topics such as recent moves by the US government
to restrict choice in data privacy reference recent discussion
on Usenet groups eg scicrypt and altsecuritypgp

gatherings several of us will bring our laptops and will sign
public keys subject to the usual caveats reference the
documentation for PGP 22 specifically files PGPDOC1DOC and
PGPDOC2DOC

If you do not already have a copy of PGP 22 MSDOS and would
like to have a copy of this public domain program please bring
a formatted medium or high density 35 inch floppy PC diskette

In the past few months interested people have emailed me

cannot in a timely manner respond to these requests  I will
however  and for the first time  do a writeup of this meeting
which I will post in various places

What I am willing to supply is general information on our
activities for the maintainers of existing FAQs such as that
for altprivacy  FAQ maintainers can contact me at
