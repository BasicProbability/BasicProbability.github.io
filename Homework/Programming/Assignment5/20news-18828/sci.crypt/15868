Subject SUMMARY responses  research on oracle password security

My original post was

I am building an oracle v6 database to serve as a repository for
information which is considered proprietary or confidential As such
I want to verify the security of oracle passwords and apply some of
the same security checking techniques we use on our nix systems
Specifically I would like to use Crack or something like it to check
the encrypted data for easily guessed passwords

The use of Crack would depend on oracle using the unix password
encryption scheme does anyone know if this is the case or what
method is used

Any other methods for security checking  audit in the oracle
environment would be much appreciated

This article will just scratch the surface of a few security
considerations comments are requested email fwworldstdcom
My thanks to the people who responded both on usenet and from
Oracle Corp

The most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit 
features or OPS passwords to control access opinion on OPS
included suggestions to use and not use I was also advised to 
use table views to refine the granularity of access control

One important security consideration in networked installations
is that OPS accounts presume that the client host provides user
authentication Os2 server OPS users are only as secure as the 
least secure machine on the network Hence you should probably 
not define any OPS accounts on systems with PCs or limit access 
of OPS accounts to data with no security concerns Unix oracle 
servers provide for disabling OPS access over the network orasrv
option while relying on host security for local processes 

Internally Oracle provides powerful and well documented sic 
audit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and
data access These tools can be used to track the primary security
risks from within the Oracle environment

Oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES
encryption Oracle Corp states that the algorithm is not prone
to cleartext attack This is a difficult claim to substantiate 
since the algorithm is unknown The concern here is that if users 
choose easily guessed passwords If a cracker can gain access 
to your oracle database files through the host operating system 
she could extract the cyphertext password data and apply 
cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords

As security risks go the above scenario is pretty low severity
Certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files
she can access to the data in them If a cracker could break 
the passwords however she could do substantial damage without
alerting the auditing mechanisms and leaving and audit trail
which would point to valid users At present Oracle like Unix
provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not 
guessable 

As with all computer security the most important defense is to 
educate users in the safe choice of passwords These techniques
are well discussed in internet rfc1281 and the Crack manual 
both available from ftp archive servers and UNIXR System
