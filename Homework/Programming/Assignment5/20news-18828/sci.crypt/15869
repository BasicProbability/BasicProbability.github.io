I wouldnt think so  Asking people to trust a secret algorithm seems
unsound to me

Maybe so but its quite common

Not when your talking about cryptography

There are millions of Macintosh users who
have no idea whats in Apples patented ROMs Many have modems connected
How do you know all your business secrets arent being stolen Answer
1 Because you trust Apple

Think again  You wont see me using apples new signature from the
finder feature

2 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
destroy Apples credibility forever

This analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility


In addition Apples proclaimed purpose in releasing the Macintosh wasnt
survellience

Quite the opposite
On January 24 Apple will introduce Macintosh and youll see why
1984 wont be like 1984

So dont give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more


In the Clipper case a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
to audit it and well have assurances maybe even from the President that
other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors While some may not
have confidence in that I am not among them its a lot more assurance
than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life

One of the reasons we should be all the more suspicious  When was the
last time the president wasted his time to comfort americans
Just another reason to look closely at exactally whats going on
