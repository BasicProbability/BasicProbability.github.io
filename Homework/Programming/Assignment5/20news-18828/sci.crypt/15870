Subject What would happen if export restrictions violated


OK I heard a lot of talk about the NSAs infamous control over encryption
export through the ITAR  Heres a question  Say I develop this great new
encryption system and I want to sell my software worldwide  The thought
police then come in and say This algorithm is a threat to national security
You will not be permitted to export it  At this point what kind of trouble
could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international
customers anyway
