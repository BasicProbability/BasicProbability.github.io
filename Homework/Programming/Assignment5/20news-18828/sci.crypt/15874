Subject Re New Encryption Algorithm


Arthur Melnick posts an interesting firsthand message about his NEA
algorithm Though I have no reason to disbelieve anything he says I want to
clarify one point

He says he has no connection with the NSA If he was part of an NSA plot
of course hed say that

Now I dont think he is But the level of some discussion here is of that
sort and very quickly we reach the point where its impossible to continue
rationally discussing some issues

I am not a crook

Well if you were of course youd say that


or the ever popular favorite

Please prove the following negative

I dont know what to do with such messages so I have taken to ignoring
them
