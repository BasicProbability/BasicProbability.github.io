 the date I have for this is 12693

         WASHINGTON UPI  The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh

 I just found out from my source that this article was a joke  Heh heh  
 It seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start  I just didnt
 notice the smiley at the end of the article and there were a few other

Well isnt this just a hoot   All I read on this group is a bunch
of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt
This just happens to be a case of an ordinaryjoenetter who decided
that he would create andor distribute some misinformation  Ppl buy

Aaack
