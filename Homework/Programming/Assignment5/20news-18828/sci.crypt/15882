Subject How to make the Clipper chip and wiretapping less bad

   Ive got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints
I have about the Clipper chip  Pass a law stating that if within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone a police agency hasnt
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrantwiretap was for
then that agency owes the suspect 1 million to repay himher for
lost privacy
   Of course there are still problems with the technical aspects of
Clipper and with the onesizefitsall mentality that would be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard  But this would be a way for
those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that there really will be a conviction
