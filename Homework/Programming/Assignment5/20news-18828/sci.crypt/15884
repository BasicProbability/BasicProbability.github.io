A messagedigest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
digest of fixed length and has three properties Computing the
digest is easy finding a message with a given
digestinversionis hard and finding two messages with the
same digestcollisionis also hard Messagedigest algorithms
have many applications including digital signatures and message
authentication

RSA Data Securitys MD5 messagedigest algorithm developed by Ron
Rivest citerfcmd5 maps a message to a 128bit message digest
Computing the digest of a onemegabyte message takes as little as a
second  While no messagedigest algorithm can yet be em proved
secure MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
to a 128bit digest  Inversion should take about 2128
operations and collision should take about 264 operations  No
one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision

Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers citedenboermd5 presents
a special kind of pseudocollision in MD5s
internal compression function which maps
a 512bit message block x and a
128bit input state s to a 128bit output
state They show how to find a message block x
and two related input states s1 and s2 that yield the same
output state fxs1  fxs2 Their wellthought approach
exploits structural properties of the collision function to find 
a pseudocollision in about 216 operations much less than one
would expect

Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
MD5 are not evident While a real collision in MD5 implies a
pseudocollision or a pseudoinversion a
pseudocollision need not imply a real collision Indeed a real
collision since it involves two different messages would almost
always involve em different message blocks x1 and x2 such that
fx1s1  fx2s2 but the pseudocollisions have the same
message blocks Moreover the input states s1 and s2 would
generally be unrelated but the pseudocollisions input states are
the same except for four bits  There does not seem to be any way to
extend den Boer and Bosselaers approach to anything beyond the
special pseudocollisions a limitation they readily admit

It is reasonable therefore to believe that MD5 remains secure While den
Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
MD5 the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
and not anything approaching real collisions Further research of
course will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and
other messagedigest algorithms with the eventual hope that
such algorithms can in some sense be proved secure
