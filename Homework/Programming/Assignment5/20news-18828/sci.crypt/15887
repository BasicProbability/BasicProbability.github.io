              Even the Department of Agriculture has successfully kept crop
 forecasts from leaking prematurely
 
 Sheesh  Remember the big scandal a year or two or 3 ago about
 exactly such leaks

My choice for the escow house would be the Smithsonian and someplace on
the west coast  My biggest concern isnt that the escrow house could
be compromised it will be but the fact it has been compromised will
be kept secret  

The keys could be kept under glass with 24hour CSPAN coverage  If you
thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable and wait until
the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key  Or if you think the
CSPAN satellite has been compromised take a tour of the Smithsonian
yourself and view the seal on your key
