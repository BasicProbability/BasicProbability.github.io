     We are strongly opposed to the clippercapstone chips  In a
press release today our president Dr Stephen Bryen stated

          It seems as if the government has an unlimited source
     of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American
     Public  But do we not understand how the National Security
     Agency which is not supposed to be involved in domestic
     spying can fund the development of a commercial chip
     intended to accommodate US government domestic spying
     activities


	Well actually this ones easy Its their job The NSA is
supposed to develop cryptosystems If the government chooses to go
ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses so be it

	This sounds a lot like slamming the competition not a cry
for justice These guys are way out on a limb if I read that right
Theyve commited their new algorithm to silicon before its been
made public What are they gonna do if Shamir writes a paper showing
how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide
rule and a pencil

	If they werent busy throwing muck to smear their competitors
Id feel kinda sorry for em Still do a little
