Subject Re Lets build software cryptophones for over the internet

I forwarded an old posting about CELP speech compression

	In case youd like to experiment with CELP you can obtain a software
	implementation of the 4800 bps Fed Std CELP coder for free

	The US DoDs FederalStandard1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
	prediction voice coder version 32 CELP 32 Fortran and C simulation source
	codes are now available for worldwide distribution at no charge on DOS
	diskettes but configured to compile on Sun SPARC stations from

Ive since been told that the source of this is on cygnuscom
in pubcelpspeechtarZ

Im not in a position to any Sun tcpip gurus out there who think they
can marry this with netfone by the end of the week   Seriously  I
think someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running
by the end of the week  Then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream
crypto filter  Two weeks at the most  Damn I wish I had my sparc
back Im stuck on a 25mhz 386sx


Share and Enjoy

PS  Youll have to use archie to find netfone  I have a copy but no note
of where its from author in the docs is kelvinautodeskcom and he
appears to be located in France
