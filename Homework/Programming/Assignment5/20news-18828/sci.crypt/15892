 Can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
 digital speech down 144K  I think it is Ive heard its not  Lets
 say 8 bit samples  Would raw data at the corresponding sampling rate
 be usable  If not how fancy does the compression need to be

 As far as I know ISDN call it Swissnet here and its being plugged in its
 8 bit 8000Hz gives you one channel of 64kBitsec I guess you should not go
 below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an
 analogline Anybody knows compressionalgorithms  factors for voice 

Ive posted some info on CELP coding on scicrypt  Looks like you can
squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a
sparcstation or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it  

This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that its feasible to run
speech over tcpip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem  Not only
will this let us run point to point encrypted speech itll let us
run speech internationally over the internet if noone stops us by
getting very heavy about regulations  The thought of this if the
administration realised would probably scare them shitless

Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol
for internet speech damn fast allowing anyone who feels brave to
inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our
workstations  Shouldnt be too difficult  The CELP stuff is standardised
we use tcpip streams and a protocol allowing silences to be used to
catch up on any net lag and also to avoid sending any data during
silences ie its not wise to be synchronised realtime on each end
because any net delays would add up to big voicelags

As for me Im going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as
I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone
Itll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night 
whether encrypted or not

You know surely someone is working on this  Who  Its so obvious
why doesnt it exist already  Ive only seen netphone for Suns and
it didnt do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections
