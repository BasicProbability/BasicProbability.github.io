Subject Re Once they get your keys

About 50 people so far have asked Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys
wont they be able to read all your future and past traffic

There has been no response from NIST NSA Ms Denning Mr Hellman or
anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer
This is troubling

Didnt NSA think about this  Or is it a feature and they thought we
wouldnt notice

I would have thought that by now they would have responded with something
of the form Well that wont be a problem because 

Very curious
