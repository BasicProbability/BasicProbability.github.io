About 50 people so far have asked Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys
wont they be able to read all your future and past traffic

There has been no response from NIST NSA Ms Denning Mr Hellman or
anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer
This is troubling

The proposal could be modified so that if they get a court order to tap you
and dont charge you with a crime within say 90 days they have to buy you
a new phone

If they do charge you and you are found innocent they have to buy you a
new phone
