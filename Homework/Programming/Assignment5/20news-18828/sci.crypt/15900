   Ive recently been reading a paper of Merkles publixhed only on the
net I think discussing three potential replacements for DES  Was
anyting ever done with these  Are Khufu Khafre andor Snefru still
being discussed anywhere  I know Snefru is referenced in the RSA
FAQ and I think it may also be in the scicrypt FAQ
   On a related topic can anyone point me toward good sites to find
papersarticlesdiscussions of cryptology  I think Ive about exhausted
the MathSci library here which doesnt seem to have anything more recent
than about 84
 
   Thanks

Khufu and Khafre are both patented 5003597  Biham and Shamir showed
that differential cryptanalysis can break 16round Khafre with a chosen
plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions  Khafre with 24 rounds
can be broken with the same attack using 253 different encryptions
There are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks if
someone wants to take the time to look

Khufu has keydependent Sboxes and is immune to differential cryptanalysis
Source code for this algorithm and Khafre are in the patent

Snefru is a publicdomain oneway hash function  The version of Snefru
that produces a 128bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force for
four passes or less  Given that SHA and MD5 are much more efficient

Oh yes anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact Dave Petre
