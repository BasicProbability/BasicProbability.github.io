Subject Re Do we need the clipper for cheap security

 There are chips which perform the voice compressionexpansion  They cant
 be expensive because they exist in many phones connected to PBXs or on the
 PBX line cards as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses
 voicegrade circuits to save the cost of longdistance leased T1s or
 satellite circuits

 I cant remember the generic term for these chips  My impression is that
 this was a big deal 10 years ago but circuits have gotten so cheap that
 it isnt done much now

Codecs  They have to get about 61 compression on 8 bit samples to squeeze
them down v32bis  I played around with the lossless shorten program
last night but it only managed 251  Ive got some specimen CELP code
but its not obvious that it runs in real time I think its just proofof
concept code and I have some mucking about with file formats to do before
I can put my own sample through it

Looks like the current option is to use a voicemail modem with builtin
DSP chip to do this in hardware  That means two modems for a system
putting the cost at 600 upwards  Ouch  Maybe soon well be able to
do it in software on highpowered games consoles  isnt the 3DO an
Acorn RISC machine inside  That cpu runs like shit off a shovel and
will be nicely massmarket too
