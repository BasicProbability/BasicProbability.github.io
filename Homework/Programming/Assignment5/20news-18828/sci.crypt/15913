    Does Dorothy Denning read this group  If not is someone on the group
 forwarding questions like these to her or Martin Hellman or anyone else
 whos seen more details about the chip

Of course she does its just shes been toasted so often for being
an NSA patsy that shes keeping her head down  You can always mail
her directly as denningguvaxaccgeorgetownedu
