I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some
intermediate point on the line Maybe they have taken a crash course
in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the
digital stream for decryption later This would still suffer from the

called BABT It has been stated either here or in the uktelecom group
that they will not approve equipment that does encryption I dont know
if this is true or not but this would make a good test case

You forget the obvious If it is an authorised tap then it can be done at
the exchange If the exchange is digital then I suspect that you can
automonitor a line and pickup the full link Therefore syncing a piggyback
modem on the line would not be impossible  I suspect
