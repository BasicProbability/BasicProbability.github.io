In article strnlghtC5wKH062xnetcomcom strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

 The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low Law enforcement has to
 present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
 authorizations
 
 Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
 recorded by the government and for that to happen they have to
 a Have a pretty good reason with evidence
 b Use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons

David given the proposition of the first first paragraph the conclusion of
the second should read

 Thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
 recorded legally by the government 
           

Which completely overturns your argument  To not see this requires an
unbelievable degree of stupidity or naivete on your part  Perhaps its time
for you to own up and say which spook agency you work for
