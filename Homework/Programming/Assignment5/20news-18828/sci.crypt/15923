Hi everybody

Does anyone know of companies that are currently manufacturing
encryption chips for sale to the general public  Get them while you
can  Some pointers would be greatly appreciated

Thanks

Steve

I believe Fishersp International makers of the Watchdogtm PC
security package offers a hardware implementation of DES as an addon
to that package
