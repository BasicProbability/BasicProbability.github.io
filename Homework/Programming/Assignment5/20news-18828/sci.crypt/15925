Subject Information on Mathematics of Cryptography followup

I posted an informational request about any electronically available
articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago  As I
mentioned I was interested in particular in DES and PublicKey 
but also wouldnt mind learning about others  As I said I can read
an intrograduate level text book having had some mathematics though
not much numbertheory per se  Id like to see the technical details
of the mathematics of cryptography as oppossed to the popularizations
of things like scientific am which just say then you find a
really big prime number

Following my request several people were so kind as to suggest
readinglists which I hope to get around to  Two other people were
so very kind as to send large documents which I presume were actual
articles about 1000 lines each but Ive stupidly deleted them
accidentally before having a chance even to skim them  If they can
forgive me for my careless use of filecommands would the original
senders be so kind as to resend Or anyone else who has good
cryptoarticles at a fairly technical mathematical level Also
ftpable or gopherable docs would be nice to know about

Yours Lulu
