 At the company I worked for previously I received a file that was
 des encryped
 and the person that had sent it went on vaction  Rather than wait
 two weeks
 I set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time  It only
 took two2
 days to crack the file  No I dont have any faith in DES

Then it was either really good luck or you had some very fast
machine  DES has 256 possible keys each two of which are simply
to convert into each other so you have to expect 254 trial encryptions
in the mean case assuming known plaintext
254  2  246060  1000000 is ca 104250
So you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond
CE Infosys builds a very fast DES chip that manages 2  encryptions
per microsecond

Yes Im not very seriously bothered about the security of DES yet
though you might prefer to use triple DES or IDEA both of which
use more key bits
