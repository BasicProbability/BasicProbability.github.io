    The clipper chips User key is formed by
  
            R1  EDEN1S1S2S1
            R2  EDEN2S1S2S1
            R3  EDEN3S1S2S1
  
    Why is the tripleencrytion used  Is it just to gain an effective
 increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch  If so why use
 80 bit keys  Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm its
 not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
 guess S1S2
  
    Why are N1 N2 and N3 formed as they are  It would be facinating to
 see the Skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require
 three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way
  
    Where do the 34bit constant values that are concatenated with the
 serial number to form N1N2N3 come from  Are they changed from chip to
 chip or session to session  Even if theyre published in the NY Times
 if SkipJack is resistant to knownplaintext attacks when using triple
 encryption then theres no break in security  But why allow that kind
 of weird format  If those three 34bit values are trulyrandom bits then
 maybe its used to ensure that a knownplaintext attack on SkipJack if
 it exists cant be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production
 run of these chips

I cant answer all our questions in detail but I can take a stab at
them

The form the operations that compute R1 R2 and R3 is of course the
famous triple encryption suggested for use with DES  Its much
stronger than a single encryption and has an effective key length of
160 bits  For reasons that were discussed when DES was first
standardized a simple double encryption would not have the same
strength  Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less
the beginning to encrypt other keys  Its recommended for anything of
very high value  And I think we can agree that the Ri and Si fit
that description

Why n1 n2 and n3  Well you need different plaintext values  I
have no idea if theyll be disclosed or not  At a guess theyre
constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible
A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1bit change
 but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit
patterns and there might conceivably be a weakness  So the ni
values are  and Im guessing  chosen to increase the Hamming
distance

In any event Im quite convinced that one cannot go back to the Si
from the Ui let alone U  Observe  if the NSA has U they dont
need to find Si  But even if they do they cant get U1 and U2  In
theory they should never even see those values even with a warrant

The real question I think is why use this scheme at all as opposed
to a hardware random number generator  My answer is that this is
much more verifiable  Look  suppose that NSA NIST the ACLU the
EFF and the NRA combined to build a really good random number
generator and that it passed every test you could think of  When you
come back next week to program some more chips does it still work that
well  Have any components changed in value  Have the components been
changed out from under you  Does it still work well the in the
presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards
selecting 1 bits  Yes you can run detailed statistical tests on it
again but thats hard

Consider on the other hand a software solution  You bring your own
floppies with you you can run cryptographic checksums etc  Its a
lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged in other words
Yes I can think of ways to cheat software too  I think that theyre
a lot harder

There are three issues with Clipper  The first is whether or not the
architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working  My answer
with one significant exception is yes  I really do think that NSA and
NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that
their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under
certain carefullycontrolled circumstances with a minimum risk of
abuse  The exception is that U exists outside of the chip on a
programming diskette  Thats seriously wrong  U1 and U2 should be
loaded onto the chip separately  To those who disagree and I dont
claim my answer is obvious though I found my own reasoning
sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions
section of my technical analysis paper  I had originally blasted the
scheme I issue this invitation  assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and
due process  What would you do differently  In answering this
question please accept NSAs fundamental assumptions  that both
strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap
some domestic users is necessary  If you feel it necessary to
challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue I
present below  Right here Im discussing just the technical
aspects  And no I dont by any means claim that just because
something can be done it should be

The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually
going to be used  Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesnt
mean that thats the only way theyll be made  Maybe the NSA will
substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the
shipping dock  And theyll generate bogus warrant requests so that
the escrow agents dont wonder why theyve never called  Sorry
guys all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have
bought tripleDES phones instead  Whod a thunk it  I have no
answer to this question and at the moment I dont see a way of
answering it  Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer
to the final question below

The third and most serious issue is whether or not Clipper is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law
I think that the answer is no but its not a nobrainer  Im a civil
libertarian not a libertarian for reasons that I explained at great
length on the net in the Elder Days and that I dont have the energy
to repeat now  But that means that Im willing to accept that some
laws are necessary so long as they respect the essential rights of
individuals  The government already has the ability and  in our
system  the right to issue search warrants and while that power has
certainly been abused its also been used quite properly and fairly in
other cases  Is key escrow sufficiently different  I think so  but
again its not an easy question for me  It is easy for libertarians
to answer of course since Clipper is completely alien to much of the
rest of their oftadmirable philosophy  And its also easy for those
who give their unreserved trust to government a group Im much more
distant from
