  The only theory that makes any sense is that S1 and S2 are either the
same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers 230 about one billion multiplied by the number
of different S1 S2 combinations

Iff the phones transmit their serial nos as part of the message then what
is to say that each phone can take that serial number and use it to generate
the required key
