About 50 people so far have asked Once the FBI gets your Clipper keys
wont they be able to read all your future and past traffic

There has been no response from NIST NSA Ms Denning Mr Hellman or
anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer
This is troubling
 
   It was implied in the first technical posting by Dorothy Denning that the
FBI would do the decryption for the law enforcement agencies  It wasnt
clear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not or
whether the FBI would just decrypt the session keys for the locals or would
do the whole message
 
   One thing Im a bit puzzled by  Why arent they doing this with a public
key scheme of some sort  You could generate two uniqe publicprivate pairsor
for each chip  Then escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies  Set
the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys  To decrypt
a message both escrow agencies in the right order for most PK schemes
have to decrypt with the escrowed private key  This way there wouldnt be
thecconcern that once the police had asked fo  a warrantwiretap they
would have your key forver
