Subject Re Clipper considered harmful Restated and amplified

  If the crooks use an innocent persons clipper phone on the tapped line
 theres no problem The Feds dont care whose phone instrument is used just
 that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line They get the
 serial number get the keys and they are in business

  So you admit that Clipper opens the doors wide for the following scenario

  FEDS We need the keys to Joe Blows phone

  ESCROW AGENT Joe Blow  You have a warrant to tap his line

  FEDS Well no but we have a warrant to tap Carlos SlimeDevil Gonzales
     line and our tap shows that Mr Gonzales is using Mr Blows phone

  ESCROW AGENT Well OK
