 Maybe so but its quite common There are millions of Macintosh users who
 have no idea whats in Apples patented ROMs Many have modems connected
 How do you know all your business secrets arent being stolen Answer
 1 Because you trust Apple
 2 Because if any such attempt however sophicsticated came out it would
 destroy Apples credibility forever

   Neither 1 or 2 apply with the government though The feds unlike
Apple have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which
to hang your freedom Why  Because unlike Apple in 2 the govt has no
credibility to lose Im serious about this One can name just about any
agency  the IRS RTC FCC FAA FBI NSA CIA  and find numerous examples
of the public trust run roughshod over Worse one can rarely find in such 
examples any serious consequences to the offending agency Even supposing
we could get a reign on trust somehow theres always the matter of competence
in govt agencies Can they even trust themselves

  PS I was amused when you mentioned the USDA as an example of an agency
capable of managing the an escrow Im a consultant to the USDA and while those
I work with are wonderful grin the agency itself is ranked in industry
publications such as Govt Computer News as one of the worst caretakers of
its computer resources Recently Prime Time Live did a long segment on
the USDAs computer troubles They are making a concerted effort to change
but intentions dont make a track record
