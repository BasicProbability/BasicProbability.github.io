  FEDS We need the keys to Joe Blows phone

  ESCROW AGENT Joe Blow  You have a warrant to tap his line

  FEDS Well no but we have a warrant to tap Carlos SlimeDevil Gonzales
     line and our tap shows that Mr Gonzales is using Mr Blows phone

  ESCROW AGENT Well OK

No no no no no no no

It will go like this

FEDS We need the key to phone 334RE67D99

ESCROW You have a warrant to tap the line phone 334RE67D99 is on

FEDS Yes

ESCROW Fine here is our key

What happens is Feds tap a line find Clipper is being used extract
serial number get key decipher convo  The serial number is never
registered to a specific owner it is sent as part of the
conversation  If I give you my Clipper phone you do not need to
reregister it mainly because it was never registered to me in the
first place

There are a lot of things that bother me about Clipper but this is
not one of them  Lets get our facts straight and not waste effort
demolishing straw men

The NSA is now funding research not only in cryptography but in all areas
of advanced mathematics If youd like a circular describing these new
research opportunities just pick up your phone call your mother and
ask for one
