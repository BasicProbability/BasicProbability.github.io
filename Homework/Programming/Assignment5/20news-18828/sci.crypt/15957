 On the other hand I can easily see them recording the traffic for
 interesting people such as dissidents suspected criminals
 foreign telephone calls and anybody noticed using encryption
 As Ken Shiriff speculates recording encrypted traffic will probably
 be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon 

As I read the current wiretap law it would not be legal now  On the
other hand assuming a legislative change recording but not decrypting
Clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme
Court using the same reasoning or the lack thereof by which they
permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers

Incidentally if we use that as our model the Court will likely not
uphold selective recording  On the other hand I dont think theyve
thrown out drug courier profiles yet  Must be that exception to
the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of
Rights

A lot  and I mean a lot  will depend on exactly how Clippertaps
or Tipperclaps for encrypted music are used  Don Alvarez showed in
the latest RISKS digest that its possible to prevent the cops from
reading traffic after their warrant expires

That is  the cops send the LEF to the Fholder  The Fholder strips
off F and sends UKN to the escrow agents  They send either U or K
to the cops  Don says U I say K  The cops cant use U in the
future because they cant strip off F  The Fholder never sees U  In
Dons model the escrow agents cant read the traffic because they
dont have K in my model they have K but not the message itself
And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI the
Fholder are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules  The
net result is that by involving the Fholder and the escrow agents on
every tap we can avoid extending permission to tap
