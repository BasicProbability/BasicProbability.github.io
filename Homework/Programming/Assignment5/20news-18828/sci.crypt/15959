 You should read the history It was Hoover who stopped Nixons COINTELPRO
 dead in its tracks because he said it was unconstitutional They tried to
 get around him every way they could
 

Unfortunately Hoover thought himself above the constitution whatever he
considered the limits others should obey He ruthlessly invaded the privacy
of many private and public citizens
