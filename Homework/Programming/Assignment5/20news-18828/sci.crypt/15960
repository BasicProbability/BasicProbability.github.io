Hell just set up a spark jammer or some other very electricallynoisy
device

As Ive noted you can likely get around that with a directional
sensor Phased array systems could completely defeat this scheme

True but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access but to make access more expensive in time
money manpower than it is worth

Another idea Use a laptop computer  As mentioned earlier the LCD screen
is a lot less noisy than a standard CRT but since many laptops have power
supplies that run at 3 volts instead of 5 they would be considerably 
quieter
