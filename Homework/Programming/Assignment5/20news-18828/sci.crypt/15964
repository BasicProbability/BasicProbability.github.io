        I am both new to this news group and to the net
        
        I am facinated by the things I have heard about the PGP
encryption program  Does anybody out there know where I might get a
version of this program that runs under Windows 31 MSDos Unix
wsource  As of this writting I have no UNIX access and am running on a
nifty windows implamentation of uucico
        Thanks in advance
