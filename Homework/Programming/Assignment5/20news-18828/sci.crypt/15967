Hell just set up a spark jammer or some other very electricallynoisy
device Or build an active Farrady cage around the room with a noise
signal piped into it While these measures will not totally mask the
emissions of your equipment they will provide sufficient interference to
make remote monitoring a chancy proposition at best There is of course
the consideration that these measures may and almost cretainly will
cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems Its a matter
of balancing security versus convenience

The problem is that this will also cause  a certain amount of interference
in all systems within the range of the device  A long time ago I built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at 
something like 4am which had just enough range to cover my room and his
However something powerful enough to mask all or at least most emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods
radio and TV reception  This isnt going to make you many friends

Incidentally an oldermodel TRS80 makes a fine wideband jammer grin
