    Just curious how would the Clipper Chip system handle
    conference calls

   Its not Clipper its any encryption system  Ive seen a number of
   designs they generally involve a multiline cleartext bridge

Depending on the encryption system so long as everyone has the same
key it can be done  For example I was using vat which is an
Internet Audio tool for a conference call and we were encrypting the
session  Unfortunately one site was doing more work and didnt
have the CPU for it so it didnt sound all that good at a different
site

So you dont neccessarily have to have a cleartext bridge  But if
you do its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation
