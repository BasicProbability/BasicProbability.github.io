Subject Re New Encryption Algorithm

     Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece New Encryption
to scicrypt there has been some discussion of our company
Secured Communications Technologies Inc and on encryption
algorithm NEA

       The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from
Friedman

	No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes 
	from someone who has already broken a very hard one

Historically Friedman has been right  Its really hard to develop
a good cypher  IBMs Lucifer the precursor to DES turns out to have
been fatally flawed  Most of the DESlike systems other than DES seem
to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis  The first two tries at
public key encryption remember knapsack cyphers were broken  Most
if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
broken eventually  Attempts in the computer era to homebrew encryption
have been disappointing the classic A survey of data insecurity packages
in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
popular security packages of the late 1980s

        A new proprietary algorithm  No way

        If the US is permitting general export of this thing it has
to be weak thats how the current regulations work  Currently theres
a willingness to allow systems with short keys 32 bits appears to be
no problem the 56 bits of DES are too many or weak algorithms
I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule to be exported
I cant believe these guys shepherded their technique through the 
PTO and the State Departments Arms Control Division without finding that out

ps No Im not thrilled with Clipper either but thats a different issue
