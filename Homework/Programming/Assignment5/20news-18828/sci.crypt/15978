Subject Re Clipper considered harmful

That is  the cops send the LEF to the Fholder  The Fholder strips
off F and sends UKN to the escrow agents  They send either U or K
to the cops  Don says U I say K  The cops cant use U in the
future because they cant strip off F  The Fholder never sees U  In
Dons model the escrow agents cant read the traffic because they
dont have K in my model they have K but not the message itself
And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI the
Fholder are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules  The
net result is that by involving the Fholder and the escrow agents on
every tap we can avoid extending permission to tap

Ive been reading this board passively for a while now and find the
subject absolutely fascinating especially from the point of view of
a civil rights nut like myself  My problem is that Im new to the field
and paragraphs like the above keep popping up  Im sure what Mr 
Bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important but I have 
NO IDEA what it means     
  
  Anyway Im keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on
that explains this stuff in lay terms I have a decent CS background but
not a huge amount of hyperadvanced math  Can anyone point me to a FAQ
or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and
maybe a little history as well  I read the piece in this months WIRED can
anyone tell me how much I should trust the references they suggest

  Thanks in advance
   Steve
