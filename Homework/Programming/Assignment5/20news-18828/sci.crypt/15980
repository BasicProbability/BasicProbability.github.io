 I am a new reader of scicrypt I would like to obtain a copy of a
 public domain program that can encrypt files preferably using DES
 that runs under MSDOS

 I would also like to obtain a program which will password protect
 floppy disks if this is possible

 Thanks

When you find out a floppy password protect program could you email me
Thanks
