  Ah but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the governments domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping


Unlike the CIA the NSA has no prohibition against domestic spying  Read
Bamfords THE PUZZLE PALACE

I did  Youre mistaken  NSAs communications intelligence mission is
strictly against foreign governments  Heres an excerpt from the enabling
charter 24 Oct 52 Truman that should clarify this  The charter was
declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public  Mind
you I dont know that they never collect anything theyre not supposed
to but spying on US citizens isnt in their charter

    b The COMINT  mission of the National  Security Agency
	NSA shall be to provide an effective  unified organization
	and control of the communications  intelligence activities of
	the United States  conducted against foreign  governments to
	provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures
	pertaining thereto   As  used in  this directive  the terms
	communications intelligence  or COMINT shall be construed
	to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception
	of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda
	broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such
	communications by other  than intended recipients  but shall
	exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of
	finished intelligence

Theyre also tasked with protecting the USs communications but I havent
seen the specific enabling memo on that  I assume thats the role under
which Skipjack was developed

NSA is not in the standardsetting business though  thats why this
Clipper stuff came from NIST which I believe is tasked with coming up
with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies
which would include NSA
