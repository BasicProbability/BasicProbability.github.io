Yes  Im not sure if my xposting to compspeech made it to here too but
Ive found that a low sample rate 3300 samplessec at 8 bits per sample
plus the pd shorten lossless sound compression code actually does get
speech into 144K with a simdgen left over  This is definitely worth
working on folks  And shorten works in well under realtime

	I dont think that this should be worked on just in the context
of cryptography Thats sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts
of people

	Whats needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone
quality speechRS232 converter Imagine if you will a little box that
takes data on its serial port and puts out sound and takes sound and codes
it to signals on its serial port Full duplex Now this device is not a
cryptographic device Its a portable poor mans sound blaster or whatever
you want to call it Its got loads of perfectly legitimate applications
for
	a speech synthesis with a few nifty libraries and some samples
	b speech recording for electronic messaging
	c building voicemail systems
	d internet talk radio
	e internet relay chat

	Of course some of the electronic messaging in item b might be
encrypted possibly realtime but thats the users decision One would
need 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout
to switch over and some code on say a 486 laptop

	Id really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done Ideally though it should be a general
purpose device It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
should be able to balk at its widespread use Obviously to make it easy
for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware

	Its interesting to note that Id already talked with a couple
of folks about building such a thing before this whole clipper thing
started I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are
able to make sample units given incentive and some time Id envisioned
finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund
development of a public domain board layout and parts set that could
be published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD
packages and in PostScript

	Anyone interested Ill start a provisional mailing list Let
me know if you want on
