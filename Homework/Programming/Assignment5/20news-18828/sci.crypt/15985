Argh This is what I get for acknowledging David Sternlights existence

In article strnlghtC602x2Ir2netcomcom strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes
 Though I think this an overstatement it does contain a grain of truth Its
 drug dealers spies terrorists and organized crime figures assuming
 enough probable cause to convince a judge who need to be watched not
 lawabiding citizens

Okay it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all

During the Vietnam war there were a great many citizens opposed to it
who considered themselves perfectly law abiding although Mr Nixon and
his lackeys thought otherwise

The Federal government had no compunction about adding people who
are otherwise decent law abiding and upstanding but disagree with
us to your nice little list Do you think this could never happen
again

Note that I am not speculating about what the government could do
but discussing the sort of observation  including but not limited
to phone tapping  that the government put its citizens under during
a time of national tension

Your naivete is still appalling BTW I mean read what you posted again
How are we to differentiate between Good People and Bad People Answer
A priori we cant we have to assume Now which way do we assume Do
we assume a priori that a citizen is lawabiding or rather a potential
CommunistDrugLordChildAbuserCultMessiah One of the things thats
supposedly great about America is the freedoms enjoyed by citizens who
are presumed to be lawabiding until proven otherwise
