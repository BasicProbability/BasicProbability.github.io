	Id really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done Ideally though it should be a general
purpose device It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
should be able to balk at its widespread use Obviously to make it easy
for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware

I suggest we start with the ubiquitous Sun to get a lot of momentum
going  Custom hardware isnt going to go anywhere until theres a
user base

	Anyone interested Ill start a provisional mailing list Let
me know if you want on

Count me in  I need someone at the US end to experiment on the 
protocols with and I like the way you code  Give me 3 weeks to
move house and settle in then well go for it seriously
