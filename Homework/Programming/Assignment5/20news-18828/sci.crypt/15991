Subject Implementing a DiffieHellman key exchange


I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper
level routines into a single data link The upper levels wont know
about this and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once at
the initial link establishment I figure that I can do this with
DES and a DiffieHellman key exchange

Is using a DiffieHellman exchange to establish a 64 bit DES key
acceptable in other words what are the pros and cons of such a 
setup Are there any important issues to watch out for aside from
filtering out unacceptable keys

And in order to achieve this I guess I will need to use 64bit math
routines for probable prime number calculation exponentiation etc
so could someone point me towards a good package this is strictly
noncommercial
