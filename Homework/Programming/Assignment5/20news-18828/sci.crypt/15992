	Id really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done Ideally though it should be a general
purpose device It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
should be able to balk at its widespread use Obviously to make it easy
for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware

I suggest we start with the ubiquitous Sun to get a lot of momentum
going  Custom hardware isnt going to go anywhere until theres a
user base

     Why dont we move down even further toward the masses by setting this
up on an IBM PC cloneprobably needs to be a 386 or a 486 with a 
sound blaster and a V32bis modem  Those components are very widely
available  I dont know if the PC has enough horsepower to encrypt the data
at realtime but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will
work at any sampling rate from 4KHz to 23 KHz
