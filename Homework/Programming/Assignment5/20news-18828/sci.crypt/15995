   I did  Youre mistaken  NSAs communications intelligence mission is
   strictly against foreign governments  Heres an excerpt from the enabling
   charter 24 Oct 52 Truman that should clarify this  The charter was
   declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public
Interesting  Where can I get the whole thing

   NSA is not in the standardsetting business though  thats why this
   Clipper stuff came from NIST which I believe is tasked with coming up
   with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies
   which would include NSA

Several of the newspaper reports have made it fairly clear that the
NSA did all the real work  You cant believe everything you read in
the papers  but the package of information the NIST is faxing out
has so little information beyond whats widely known that it sounds
like its true

				Pray for peace      Bill
