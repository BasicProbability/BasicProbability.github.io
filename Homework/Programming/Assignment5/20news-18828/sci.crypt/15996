    Does Dorothy Denning read this group  If not is someone on the group
 forwarding questions like these to her or Martin Hellman or anyone else
 whos seen more details about the chip

Of course she does its just shes been toasted so often for being
an NSA patsy that shes keeping her head down  You can always mail
her directly as denningguvaxaccgeorgetownedu
denningcscoscgeorgetownedu or denningcsgeorgetownedu

I found the personal attacks on Prof Denning pretty disgusting
I dont agree with all her positions but I think scholars can
disagree without the argument getting into the gutter

If these personal attacks are what stopped Prof Denning from
replying on issues of substance they have cause real harm
to the serious debate here
