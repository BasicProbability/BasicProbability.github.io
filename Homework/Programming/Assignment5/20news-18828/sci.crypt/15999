I havent been able to open an ftp session with that machine

Operating under the assumption that the address was wrong I tried using
nslookup and nicnamewhois

 ls nistgov 
nnscnsfnet

Thats all I could find about the ncsl domainoh and I tried an MX lookup
on the machine in question which failed  Nicnamewhois domain lookups at
both registries failed too 

So I thought hey Im just not using the tools right and tried calling
the BBS number  no answer

Im probably doing something wrongor perhaps the machine has been put
behind a firewall  But it does look like csrcncslnistgov has become an
unmachine  If someone would try ftping to it or knows whats up Id
really appreciate the info
