 Just curious how would the Clipper Chip system handle
 conference calls

Its not Clipper its any encryption system  Ive seen a number of
designs they generally involve a multiline cleartext bridge

        A multiline cleartext bridge
                      
        And just were would you put that bridge  If it isnt at one of
the receiptants location forget encryption at all  You have blown any
security you thought you might have had
