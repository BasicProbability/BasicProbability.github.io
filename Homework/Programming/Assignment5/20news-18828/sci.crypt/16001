        Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive
 Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch it seems clear that one
 of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
 Judicial Branch  I suggest the Supreme Court or regionally the
 Courts of Appeal  More specifically the offices of their Clerks
 
 Ive got a better idea  We give one set to the KGB co Washington embassy
 and the other set to the Red chinese
 
IMHO one should place the keybanks into satellites space The 
recovery should be done only by highly visible teams of astronauts
