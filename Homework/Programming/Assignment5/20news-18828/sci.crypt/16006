Subject Re Wiretapping reality today

 A little perspective might be in order

I cannot believe you can make these claims given hard evidence of
abuse  Do you ignore stories about survellience of Martin Luther
King have you blocked from your mind McCarthys crusade in the 50s

 The number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low

And how many illegal wiretaps are performed  Funny but Ill be that
the FBI doesnt keep statistics on these

confidential informer  illegal wiretap
