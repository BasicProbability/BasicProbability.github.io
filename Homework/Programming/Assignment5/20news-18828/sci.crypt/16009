Subject Re Clipper considered harmful Restated and amplified

Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of superencryption  An automated fullsystem surveillance
mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F
can validate Clipper wrappers and NESN associations but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of superencryption unless it knows all unit keys
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces upon specific wiretaplike order

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block with a 34 bit filler  Doesnt
take a lot to check to see if that is correct
