  The Clipper Chip device introduced yesterday by ATT may not be
 suitable for government use says House Telecom Subcommittee Chairman
 Markey  In a letter to Commerce Secretary Brown Markey asked whether
 the use of the technology could lead to inadvertently increased costs
 to those US companies hoping to serve both the government and
 private markets  Markey has ordered Brown to answer several questions
 about security and cost concerns by April 28  Communications Daily

This is stupid  Wont it cost more to those companies hoping to 
serve the govt and private markets if they DONT use the same
technology
