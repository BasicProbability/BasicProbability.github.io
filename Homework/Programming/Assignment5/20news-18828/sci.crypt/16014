 Hi everybody
 
 Does anyone know of companies that are currently manufacturing
 encryption chips for sale to the general public  Get them while you
 can  Some pointers would be greatly appreciated

Motorola certainly makes them but I dont know how you
would go about buying one  Youd probably have to buy one
of our secure radios  

You could also bring in encryption chips from outside the country
