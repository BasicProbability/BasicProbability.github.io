how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

It depends on the mode youre using  For a single 64bit input block a
onebit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits  in other words it essentially turns the output block into
a random number  If youre encrypting data in CBC mode however only the
one 64bit block will be affected  The next block and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly

Its a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely
