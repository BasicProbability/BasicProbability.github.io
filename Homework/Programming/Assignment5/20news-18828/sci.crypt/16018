   OK I should have read the thread before posting my own 002  I would
   just add to Phils very infomative discussion the following caveat the
   fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases  nor shall any person 
     be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself

    Maybe you are using the wrong amendment  If someone were to seize
a safe containing your paper records and demand that you produce
the combination the applicable defense would be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure  The police would be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter but any broad search
such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional
In the case of the safe they would probably get a locksmith and
assert that they ONLY examined documents covered by the warrent
Sure  In the cryptographic case their only resort would be
rubberhose cryptography

    This would also make a good mental experiment to use in
choosing escrow agents  Would you trust this proposed agent with a
key to your hard diskor half the key for that matter
