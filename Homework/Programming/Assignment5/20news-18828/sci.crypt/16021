         I am facinated by the things I have heard about the PGP
 encryption program  Does anybody out there know where I might get a
 version of this program that runs under Windows 31 MSDos Unix
 wsource  As of this writting I have no UNIX access and am running on a
 nifty windows implamentation of uucico

At the moment PGP is available in executable format for MSDOS and Mac
and source code for most other platforms including UNIX Many FTP sites
keep a copy although the Mac version is getting hard to find Try the
following site

sodaberkeleyedu           pubcypherpunkspgp
