Subject Re Clipper and conference calls


     Just curious how would the Clipper Chip system handle
     conference calls
 
 Depending on the encryption system so long as everyone has the same
 key it can be done  For example I was using vat which is an
 Internet Audio tool for a conference call and we were encrypting the
 session  Unfortunately one site was doing more work and didnt
 have the CPU for it so it didnt sound all that good at a different
 site

You would have to use something other than the ATT black box  in other
words I dont think public key would work  The session key would have 
to be agreed upon prior to the conversation and distributed to all 
sites beforehand

Or go out and get a STUIII
