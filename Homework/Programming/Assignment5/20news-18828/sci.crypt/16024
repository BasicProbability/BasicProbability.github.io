Subject Re Clipper considered harmful Restated and amplified

   Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
   conceal use of superencryption  An automated fullsystem surveillance
   mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F
   can validate Clipper wrappers and NESN associations but it cannot reveal
   in realtime the use of superencryption unless it knows all unit keys
   which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
   pieces upon specific wiretaplike order

   The serial number will be in a 64 bit block with a 34 bit filler  Doesnt
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct

Depends on whether the filler is a constant makes checking easy
but susceptible to replay or variable eg timer counter random
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if theyve missed messages or gotten them out of
sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about

It is still easy to conceal superencryption at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the K key which can take a while
presumably not in nearrealtime  Worstcase in which the escrow agencies
provide the U key to the local cops still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant unless the same key is used for both directions
which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on
