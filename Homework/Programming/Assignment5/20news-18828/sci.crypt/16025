    conference calls
   Its not Clipper its any encryption system  Ive seen a number of
   designs they generally involve a multiline cleartext bridge

	   A multiline cleartext bridge
			 
	   And just were would you put that bridge  If it isnt at one of
   the receiptants location forget encryption at all  You have blown any
   security you thought you might have had 

Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are
military or equivalent like CIA and other embassy personnel
so putting bridges on the recipients location is normal 
its in a vault on a military base or Ft Meade and the
secure phones are in soundproof rooms with big locks on the doors
because theyre talking about Classified Stuff or Golf with Other Generals

That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our
offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans
and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info
and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob
most people dont use soundproof vaults and may use bridges in their
PBX or from the local phone company 3way calls or Long Distance
or valueadded phone company eg Alliance conference bridges

If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones
the conferencing aspects dont change  But there may be a market niche for
trusted conferencebridge providers though I suppose the inquisitors
would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges
just in case a Bad Guy might use the service
