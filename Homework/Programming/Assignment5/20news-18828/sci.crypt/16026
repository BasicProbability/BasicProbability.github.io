Im afraid this doesnt work either We can pick up laptop screens without any
problem

Most of the socalled low radiation monitors are also useless The description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one

We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military Tempest kit but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers We built a prototype it works
and its still sitting on my lab bench Commercial interest was exactly zero

In the absence of open standards a monitor which really is low radiation
and costs 500 dollars more cant compete against a monitor which just
claims to be low radiation and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box

I heard somewhere cant name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
or refute this
