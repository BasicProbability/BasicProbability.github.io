 	Id really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
 internet talk radio could be done Ideally though it should be a general
 purpose device It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
 should be able to balk at its widespread use Obviously to make it easy
 for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware
 
      Why dont we move down even further toward the masses by setting this
 up on an IBM PC cloneprobably needs to be a 386 or a 486 with a 
 sound blaster and a V32bis modem  Those components are very widely

	I concur for a PC to PC version  BUT for a interactive thing like
internet talk radio  It makes me cringe at the amount of hogging such
a thing would do to the bandwidth of the internet  I mean 15 meg files getting
floated around for internet talk radio is bad enough  I have a solution use
the phone system take your electronics and use them on point to point 
conversations through the phone and thats it  If you need to tell someone 
something secret and very important wouldnt it make more sense to write it 
out concisely And if its just a quick YO then use a code word and spend 
your twenty cents
	Those good ol analog systems like Shortwave Telephones and TVs have
a use dont gunk up a nice digital packet network trying to emulate them
