 Think again  You wont see me using apples new signature from the 
 finder feature 

Why not  It hasnt been released so theres no way for you to evaluate it 
yet  After all Apple could have been smart and had AOCE use an MD5 hash 
encrypted with RSA just like PKCS signatures  They could even be actually 
PKCS compliant for all you know why not wait until it is released and hard 
information is available before passing judgement on it

AOCEs algorithms arent secret because Apples being fascisticAOCE itself 
remains secret except for Apple demos at MacWorld  simply because its 
not done yet

It may be flawed and it may not  However you cant tell which until you 
actually see it  I at least am quite impressed with what I have seen so 
far and have no expectation of being disappointed
