Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of superencryption  An automated fullsystem surveillance
mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth which knows family key F
can validate Clipper wrappers and NESN associations but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of superencryption unless it knows all unit keys
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces upon specific wiretaplike order

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block with a 34 bit filler  Doesnt
take a lot to check to see if that is correct

Yes but the extra encryption could be applied before the message
is encrypted by the Clipper so that the wrapper would be fine the
phones serial number and the session key would be in the lawenforcement
field etc but the message wouldnt be readable even if the particular
Clippers key were obtained from the escrow agents  In fact it shouldnt
even be possible to detect that a message has been doubleencrypted without
a court order right
