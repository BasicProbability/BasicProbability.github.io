It is still easy to conceal superencryption at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the K key which can take a while
presumably not in nearrealtime  Worstcase in which the escrow agencies
provide the U key to the local cops still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant unless the same key is used for both directions
which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on

I was under the impression from reading Dennings description of the
Clippers operation that the same session key is used in both directions for
encrypting the message text but that each chip uses its own key for
encrypting the session key into the lawenforcement field  So you only
need to know the U key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions
