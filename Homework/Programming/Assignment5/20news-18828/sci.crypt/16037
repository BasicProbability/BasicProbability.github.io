To be quite honest the way things are going Id call it self defense

I never advocated not saying what you believe in  Im advocating second
thought and calm  

A smart warrior defeats the enemy in ambush on the battlefield
A smarter warrior defeats the enemy in open warfare on the battlefield
The smartest warrior defeats the enemy without using the battlefield

Think about it  

I have my thesis was on Sun Tzu

More to the point

Those who are called the good militarists of old could make opponents
lost contact between front and back lines lose reliability between
large and small groups lose mutual concern for the welfare of the
different social classes among them lose mutual accomodation between
the rulers and the ruled lose enlistments among the soldiers lose
coherence within the armies  They went into action when it was
advantageous stopped when it was not

Today it is  Sitting on your hands will get you nowhere in this battle
