Ive been reading the scicrypt altprivacyclipper and comporgefftalk
discussions about the Clipper chip and find as usual that most of us
think alike  so theres a lot of repitition  If each of these messages
were sent to Clinton as well as to the net or instead of to the net we
might actually have some effect

	0005895485MCIMAILCOM  White House

Is this White House email address really working yet Someone
posted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago but apparently
the White House wasnt really set up to recive hundreds thousands
of messages a day to that account and didnt want people to use it
yet So is this MCI address something the people at the White House
actually read or is it another Craig Shergold story I dont know 
Im just asking

Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail
every day you may have better luck printing out a letter on paper
that flat white stuff all over my desk and SnailMailing it to the
White House I imagine writing to your local representative and
senator wouldnt hurt either Heck why not write to Al Gore while
youre at it
