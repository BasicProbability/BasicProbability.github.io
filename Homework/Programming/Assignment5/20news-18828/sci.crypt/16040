Is this White House email address really working yet Someone
posted such an address on CompuServe a few months ago but apparently
the White House wasnt really set up to recive hundreds thousands

	This is a real address My understanding of the current process
that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed
by retiree volunteers who match the message against message profiles
and check the message count Ie yeah thats a for gays in the
military whats this clipper stuff must be against gays in the
military

	The highervolume whitehouse email stuff is in the works
I know for a fact but wont be online for probably another month
or two at the soonest My understanding is that the link speed will
increase direct internet instead of Compuerve to floppy but the
message processing will remain the same

Unless the people at the White House print and distribute this mail
every day you may have better luck printing out a letter on paper
that flat white stuff all over my desk and SnailMailing it to the
White House I imagine writing to your local representative and
senator wouldnt hurt either Heck why not write to Al Gore while
youre at it

	The white house email does get read I agree that printing it
and sending Cc to everyone you can think of is probably better because
it is more visible but the message processing fitting messages against
a template is the same in either case
