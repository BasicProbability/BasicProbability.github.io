Subject Re Is it illegal to transmit encrypted data

In article C63Ly7GBxsugarneosoftcom georgelNeoSoftcom George Livsey writes
      I am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act
   on the export of cryptographic technology however is it illegal to
   transmit encrypted data from the US to another country  If so
   then which laws apply to this situation

From the US law perspective unless youre engaging in illegal speech
its not illegal to use encryption  Yet  The NSA is allowed to try
to listen but youre not obligated to make it easy for them  Yet
The other country may have more repressive laws about that
I gather Frances bureaucracy wants to know what youre saying 
and in the old Soviet Union they didnt need laws to make things illegal 

paranoia follows for those of you who want to play it safe 
The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate RSAs patents eg if you use PGP the
NSA may tell RSA that youre doing so and if the Secret Service catches on
they may decide that the mere fact that RSA hasnt filed a lawsuit
against you doesnt mean that you dont deserve to have your computer
confiscated for possible patent violation munitions law violation
espionage money laundering drug importation and creatin a disturbance
and then not give it back because you did violate the patent even
though they had to drop all the other charges unlike that nasty Steve
Jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of anything
