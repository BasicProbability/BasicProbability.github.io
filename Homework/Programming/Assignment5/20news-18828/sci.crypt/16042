   Im afraid this doesnt work either We can pick up laptop screens without any
   problem 

   I heard somewhere cant name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
   pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
   that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
   on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
   or refute this

Yes thats true  TEMPEST is nothing magic its just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff 

The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of
signal so theyre easy to detect and if you do your sync carefully
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptivelymarked
Chevy StepVan  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse
In both cases its especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk etc

With newer quieter equipment there isnt as much signal and its harder to
isolate the fun parts  TEMPESTrated equipment has much lower signal levels
But Everything has vibrations as Master Chuan said
