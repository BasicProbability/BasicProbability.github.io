Im afraid this doesnt work either We can pick up laptop screens without any
problem

Most of the socalled low radiation monitors are also useless The description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one

We thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military Tempest kit but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers We built a prototype it works
and its still sitting on my lab bench Commercial interest was exactly zero

In the absence of open standards a monitor which really is low radiation
and costs 500 dollars more cant compete against a monitor which just
claims to be low radiation and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box

I heard somewhere cant name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
or refute this

Just thought of something  Yes laptops can still be read but its not quite
as easy as a normal pc with a CRT  My thought Airline pilots lately have
been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the planes
instruments  If this can be hyped up manufacturers may start building
laptops with even lower emmisions  It would probably still be possible to
pick up with surveillance equipment but at this point it would be a lot
cheaper to mask the remaining signals with TEMPEST techniques
