Subject Re Implementing a DiffieHellman key exchange

   You should probably use numbers much larger than 64bits  Also you
may want to include some randomlygenerated bitstrings in your protocol
This way if someone should find the shared key you and another person
use on one day they wont be able to guess it for the next day
 
   Ie A sends GA mod P and random string R0
      B sends GB mod P and random string R1
 
      Both find GA mod P B mod P  Shared Key then both calculate
 
      Session Key  HashR0Shared Key R1
 
   Also you will want to make sure that youre getting the right public
key value GA mod P  Someone with the power to intercept and change messages
can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you his public key and then
acquiring a session key with each of you
