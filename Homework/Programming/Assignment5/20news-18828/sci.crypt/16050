Subject A Trojan Horse on the Clipper

Gentlefolk

        It seems to me that the Step 1 of taking a warrant to the
        telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring dont
        you love animal metaphors

        With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
        ENF is not syntactically different than N all they
        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
        todays target and use the serial number to identify the
        session they want and get the chip number of the other end of
        the conversation Even without the key this is great for
        traffic analysis I can think of several ways to learn the
        right serial number

        It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to
        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
        cooperate or risking getting caught in the act with your
        alligator clips erect This is particularly handy if you have
        S1 and S2

        BTW did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
        number
        
        Cheers
                Marc
