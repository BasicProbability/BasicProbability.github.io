 GUESS WHAT PEOPLE  You live in one of the few countries in the world
 where a person can complain without getting shot at  

        Only guessing but from his address Id say that Jerry like
        me lives in Canada Unlike me he thinks that our friends in
        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us

        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement Our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials Its
        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals Any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they dont
        like his or her attitude its national news It also often
        blows up in their faces eg the wellintentioned but flawed
        Zundel case which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme
        Court not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to
        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under

        Our friends south of the border dont have as easy a time of
        it Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we
        have agencies and some of them have teeth They also have the
        War on Drugs which gives lawenforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals rights the DEA has more
        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the
        War Measures Act We have the RCMP and CSIS who cant stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
        suppression of private citizens rights Not only that our
        Police Commissions have teeth as I learned when I had to fend
        off a bent cop

        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life Liberty and
        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting governmentimposed order
        while the nation founded on Peace Order and Good Government
        is getting inyourface liberty

        Thats not to say our time wont come It looks like Chretien
        is going to run on a lawandorder platform Be afraid

        Cheers
                Marc
