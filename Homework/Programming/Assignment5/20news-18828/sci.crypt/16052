 The only thing that worries me is that 21 compression  the
 SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware but other than that
 I dont have a good feel for how processor intensive it is so I cant
 estimate how fast a PC youd need

        Theres a better way Doesnt Qualcom have a secure design
        that it decided not to market  Since they arent going to
        use it wouldnt the patriotic thing be to put the design in
        the public domain How about selling a Cryptography
        Educational Kit with the critical parts Something that could
        end up as a PC option board with two phone jacks

        Cheers
                Marc
