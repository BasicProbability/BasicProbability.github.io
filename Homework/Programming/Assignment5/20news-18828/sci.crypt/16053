 Great slogan  Im ready to sign up with a cryptolobbying effort though
 I wouldnt want to do it through an NRA offshoot  Shall we also push
 for the CRA   Cryptographic Rights Amendment 

        Looking at it from up here in the Frozen North it looks like
        you could do worse than get the NRA involved They have a
        kindred problem a large number of voters the right attitude
        and lots of funds

        From an ethical or constitutional viewpoint I havent seen
        a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesnt also
        support the NRA position on guns and viceversa

        Cheers
                Marc
