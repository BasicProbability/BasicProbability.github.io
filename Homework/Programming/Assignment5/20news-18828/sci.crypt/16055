Subject Re New Encryption Algorithm

   Well actually this ones easy Its their job The NSA is
 supposed to develop cryptosystems If the government chooses to go
 ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses so be it

  Ah but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the governments domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping


But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping  The actual wiretapping will
presumably be conducted by the FBI  Of course the capability for this was
provided by the NSA but I think that they are still within the limitations
of their charter

I realize this is a fine point and some may differ but this is my opinion
Although I dont care for Clipper and wont support or use it I dont see
the NSA as having overstepped their bounds
