Subject Re Lets build software cryptophones for over the internet

Hmmm CELP takes up about 126 MIPS for full duplex and has been
implemented on about a million DSP chips the 56001 card in my PC only cost
about 700 and Im sure once demand goes up the prices would drop The Analog
Devices 21020 board that were looking at now cost about 500 academic price
I dont think hardware is something to worry about if you get it working
people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow
What we need here is a good implementation of CELP the government code is
absolute crap I got a 30 speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours
and modifications to pgp to allow it to compressdecompress 144 bit frames
every 30msec I think the AD21020 should have enough juice for this 50MIPS
As part of the project Im working on now were trying to get CELP up and
running in realtime full duplex mode I gotta find the source to pgp and
see how tough it would be to integrate the endecryption parts into the code
Ill play with it Anyone else out there got an AD21020 setup
