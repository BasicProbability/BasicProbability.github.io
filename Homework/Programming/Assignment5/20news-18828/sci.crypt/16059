I heard somewhere cant name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
or refute this

As anyone who attended HoHoCon will attest you can pick information
off the video chip  Its surprisingly easy too  The guy did it with
a portable TV with very minor mods  It only worked from 3 feet but
then it was just a demonstration

The NSA is now funding research not only in cryptography but in all areas
of advanced mathematics If youd like a circular describing these new
research opportunities just pick up your phone call your mother and
ask for one
