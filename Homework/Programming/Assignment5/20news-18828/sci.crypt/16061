Im not a lawyer and I dont even play one on TV but intuitively theres
something wrong with having ones words archived for possible future
use against you  This possibility frightens me more than any of the
talk about the Clipper Chip right to cryptography etc



I can just imagine it  The mother is wheeled into the labour ward  After
delivery a government agent steps up to read the baby its rights
	You have the right to remain silent  If you give up this right anything
	you say may be taken down and used in evidence against you

	Waaaaaaaaah
