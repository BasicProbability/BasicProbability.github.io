The fact that the NSA is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate RSAs patents eg if you use PGP the
NSA may tell RSA that youre doing so and if the Secret Service catches on

Im afraid I have to disagree with you on that point  NSA will not
tell RSA or any other nonDOD entity anything that its eavesdropping
reveals  That includes the FBI and Secrect Service although there
have been rare exceptions
