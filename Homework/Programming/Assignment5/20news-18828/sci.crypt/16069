Subject Re PGP Where to get it

At the moment PGP is available in executable format for MSDOS and Mac
and source code for most other platforms including UNIX Many FTP sites
keep a copy although the Mac version is getting hard to find Try the
following site

sodaberkeleyedu           pubcypherpunkspgp

For those with out FTP access try NitVBBS see sig  I have the following
all from nicfunetfi garbouwasafi sonycom and ftpunierlangende

PLATFORM    EXECS   SOURCE   PATCH4SRC   XTRAS  BBS FILE AREA    FIDO FREQNAME

DOS           x       x                    x      LOGIN         PGPDOS PGPSDOS
MAC           x       x                           NONIBM        PGPMAC PGPSMAC

NeXT                            x                 NONIBM        PGPNXT
UNIX          x       x                           NONIBM        PGPUNX

  havent looked in the archive to see if it has source or not usually 
because I cant handle the format  For FidoNet FREQ magicnames the
PGPS names are source code others are either execs or execs  src 
 extras or in the case of NeXT just a patch you still need one of
the full source code packages

NitVBBS is FREE  This is not an ad it is a public service announcement
