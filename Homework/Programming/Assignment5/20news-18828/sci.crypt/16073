OK I heard a lot of talk about the NSAs infamous control over encryption
export through the ITAR  Heres a question  Say I develop this great new
encryption system and I want to sell my software worldwide  The thought
police then come in and say This algorithm is a threat to national security
You will not be permitted to export it  At this point what kind of trouble
could I get into if I ignored the ITAR and sold my program to international
customers anyway

You would be arrested as an international arms trafficker

There are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in court 
The concensus appears to be

You could be arrested as an international arms trafficker  You could
regardless of the state of the law but there are some paragraphs which
suggest you would be violating the law

If it goes to court the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the
First amendment or the court could rule that software is technical
data not subject to the ITARs or the court could rule that the
phrase publicly available as defined in the ITARs would apply
making it only subject to requiring a general export license or you could
be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage  General
concensus among lawyers who have read the ITARs is that one of the first
two would occur
