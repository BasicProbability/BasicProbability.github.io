   The serial number will be in a 64 bit block with a 34 bit filler  Doesnt
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct

Depends on whether the filler is a constant makes checking easy
but susceptible to replay or variable eg timer counter random
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if theyve missed messages or gotten them out of
sequence or other interesting things that sort of person might care about

Id use a secret nope obscure cryptographic encoding to expand the 
30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block The redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the LE block by random data 

And of course the LE block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct LE block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back 

For those of you who might want to mangle the LE block eg by xoring 
a constant pattern on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies 
of this block perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so at regular intervals during the transmission If the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext you know  its just like a checksum for your own 
safety  

The monitoring agencies wont have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded LE blocks 
within the transmission These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol

So dont anyone think that you can use the chip and fool LE about the 
tapping key  I bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above Of course its absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms and protocols remain secret Personally I doubt they will
