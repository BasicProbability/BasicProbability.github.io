CompuServe is in Columbus OH  So are the corporate headquarters of several 
major insurance companies the largest private RD company in the world 
Batelle Memorial Institute DCSC The Defense Construction  Supply 
Center Ohio State University one of the three largest US universities 
OCLC the Online College Library Center and so on  Youd be amazed 
actually

Dont forget Chemical Abstracts Service which is pretty much the international
clearinghouse for all chemical information whose former director Ronald
Wigington and head of RD Nick Farmer were openly former NSA employees
