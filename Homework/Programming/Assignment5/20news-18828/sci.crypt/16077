Subject Summary How sensible is DES towards biterrors

Hi

Id like to thank you all for the fast responses 
Special thanks go to those who replied lexical order

My question was

how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

How much of the DESencrypted data is affected depends on the used
encryption mode According to Marcus J Ranum mjrTISCOM there is

	cfb  cipher feedback mode
	ecb  electronic code book mode
	cbc  cipher block chaining mode
	ofb  output feedback mode

	each mode does some stuff better than others ofb and cfb are designed
for communications streams more than for files

Unfortunally people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction
of all of the following data Sure seems that some modes will resync quite
fast others will never others will even only effect the very block

Summarized people said concerning this matter


In CBC mode only the current block will be affected tarnoldvnetIBMCOM

If you use CBC Cihper Block Chaining then the remainder of the data
will be destroyed as well pauschsaafse Paul Schlyter

In CFB mode DES synchronizes quite fast probably within 1 block 
according to Maracus J Ranum mjrTISCOM


Maybe someone definitely knows what happens in which mode

Nevertheless Thank you all very much again

It depends on the mode youre using  For a single 64bit input block a
onebit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits  in other words it essentially turns the output block into
a random number  If youre encrypting data in CBC mode however only the
one 64bit block will be affected  The next block and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly

Its a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely

In article ad735831059cat you write
Hello

how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

At least 8 bytes of data will be destroyed if one bit encrypted data is
in error

If you use CBC Cihper Block Chaining then the remainder of the data
will be destroyed as well

DES is VERY seisitive for single bit errors  This is as it should be

Probably very bad you might lose the rest of the data stream  If you
want safety against dropped bits use an error correcting coder like the
freeware GNU ecc

From wcsanchorhoattcom

   how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors How much data per
   bit will be lost in average I assume you still have the correct key

It depends on the mode youre using DES in
Electronic Code Book ECB takes a block of 64 input bits
and produces 64 output bits so if any bits are changed
the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad
I forget which feedback mode is which
In all of them the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks
With some modes the system selfsynchronizes so errors are repaired
in a few blocks  With other modes once one block is bad
all later blocks will be bad too

Theres also the framing problem  If you have a bit change
the block that its in changes and maybe later blocks also change
But if you have bits lost or bits added 64 bits in 63 or 65 bits out
everything is confused after that



From Marcus J Ranum mjrTISCOM

	depends on the mode youre using cfb for example synchronises
pretty fast figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the
next one
