   In this giant ballyho over this Clipper chip I noticed a rather
   disturbing trend in some of the Email and posts Ive tossing back and
   forth  

Me too A tendency on the part of some people to hide their head in
the sand

I never advocated hiding in the sand  Im advocating a peaceful
solution while a peaceful solution is possible  Unless you want blood on
your hands

No one has mentioned violence other than you Mr Han I believe you
are imagining things
