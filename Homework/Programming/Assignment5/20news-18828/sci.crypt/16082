Subject Re Dorothy Denning opposes Clipper Capstone wiretap chips

The security of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys

The ability to tap is an inherent insecurity which depends fundamentally on
the secrecy of the algorithm  To spell it out because so many people seem to
miss the point if the algorithm were published anyone could create a chip
which would work correctly with the Skipjack chips but which would not have
its key registered

I believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
government maintaining a secret of some kind  For example the secret could be
the private keys of the escrow agencies their digital signatures would be
required before a key could be used  In this case the NSANISTwhoever has
decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easiercheapermore secure than
other possible protocols
