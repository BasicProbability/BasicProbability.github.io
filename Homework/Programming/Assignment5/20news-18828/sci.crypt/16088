Subject How to make this illuminating thing


In some hobby shop they sell a flexible tube 14inch diameter
18inch ling that will illuminate if you bend or shake it it
is also sold in amusement parks in the evenings The brightness
can last 2 to 4 hours If it is left in refrigrator in coldness
you can prolong its life of illumination

Is this something we can make ourself easily Or do you know any
reading can provide details about this stuff Working with kids
it would be nice if it can be a doityourself project with 
minimum budget
