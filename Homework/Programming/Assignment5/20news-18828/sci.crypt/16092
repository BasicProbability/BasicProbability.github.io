  Well that explains it  The government has no real need to spy on people
who already love Big Brother its the people who are inclined to talk
back who need to be watched

Though I think this an overstatement it does contain a grain of truth Its
drug dealers spies terrorists and organized crime figures assuming
enough probable cause to convince a judge who need to be watched not
lawabiding citizens

And thus COINTELPRO in which horrible people who threatened the
republic by disagreeing with the Government were systematically kept
track of for years
