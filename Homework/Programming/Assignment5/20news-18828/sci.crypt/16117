 We dont know this do we  The algorithm is classified 

I speculate from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK78 that the algorithm 
is a classified cryptosystem similar in application to DES but cleared by 
the NSA for classified traffic that has been in use for a number of years  
Myktotronx refers to it as Government Type II encryption which matches the 
designation of one of the types of encryption available on STUIII phones 
and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called CIPHER2

This would make sense since this is evidently a fieldproven cryptosystem 
which can act as a pincompatible substitute for DES  Combined with a 
tappable key exchange protocol this would offer exactly what is claimed for 
Clipper secure encryption with access via a key escrow  If this is fact the 
case it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself

Now I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem my knowledge 
of classified cryptography isnt even fuzzy  its nonexistent  However 
it would certainly have been the leasteffort approach on the part of the 
government take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES 
and which is at least as secure set up a key escrow scheme for law 
enforcement and promote it for public use  This also fits with Mykotronx 
whos been around but almost invisible for years

Has anyone else made this sort of connection or am I just hallucinating pink 
elephants here   My curiousity has been piqued
