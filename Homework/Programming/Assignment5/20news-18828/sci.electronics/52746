Subject Need sources for HV capacitors

Recently my video monitor went dead no picture some low distorted sound
I didnt hear the telltale cracking that indicated HV at work nor are the
filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange just nothing

On examining the power board I noticed the largest capacitor with a very
bad bulge at the top  Naturally I want to replace it but I cant find
any sources

The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV  It has radial leads and is
roughly 1 12 inches long 1 18 wide  The dimensions are important since
the whole board fits in a metal cage leaving little room

Living in the Los Angeles area Ive been to numerous stores Dow Radio
All Electronics ITC Elect Sandys Yale Elect with empty hands

Can anyone suggest sources for highvoltage capacitors  Mail order is 
fine although Id rather check out a store to compare the can  Im going
to try a video electronics store hopefully theyll have HV caps

By the way the monitor is a ATARI SC1224 Goldstar circuitry Masushita
tube  Anyone else had problems

Thanks in advance
