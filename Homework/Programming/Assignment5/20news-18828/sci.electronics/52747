Subject Re Help with ultralong timing

In article C513wIG5Aathenacsugaedu mcovingtaisun3aiugaedu Michael Covington writes
 1 Dont use big capacitors  They are unreliable for timing due to
 leakage 
 
 Instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by 2 40 times
 or something like that
 
 1 MHz divided by 240  1 cycle per 2 weeks approximately
 
 2 I wouldnt expect any components other than batteries or electrolytic
 capacitors to fail at 40 C or 40 F for that matter either  
 The battery is going to be your big problem  Also of course your
 circuit shouldnt depend on exact values of resistors which a crystal
 controlled timer wont
 

 Wouldnt a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that as a
mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant frequency
