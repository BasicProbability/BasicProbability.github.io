 After a considerable amount of research review of discussions 
 on this group and mainly fruitless time on breadboards I have 
 decided that the path of least resistance for prototyping my not 
 necessarily someone elses electronic designs is wire wrapping  

	I have no idea about what you want to do but be careful 
Wire wrapping increases a lot the wiring capacitance That shouldnt
be a problem for slow applications ie a few MHz but as for
quicker ones around 30  40 MHz I doubt that it can work


	Fortunately wirewrapping is a better wiring technique than
most at high frequencies Cray computers up to the XMP at least
all had wirewrapped backplanes  Wirewrap gets into trouble at
much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle  The increase
of wiring capacitance is not really relevant you have to use
transmission line techniques and the capacitance is no problem

 1 Where can I get a decent wrapping tool  Id like to spend less 
 than 150 for an AC powered unit including bit and sleeve

	Hand powered is the best There are good AC powered ones
but rather expensive A lowcost one doesnt work very well

	Handpowered is a terrible choice IMHO unless you are
a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections
at a time  Your hands will cramp  Batterypowered wirewrap guns
are available in the 150 range and so are the little
twiddlestick manual types 15  For a modest project of
a couple hundred connections Id prefer to borrow a professional
AC unit or a pneumatic one
