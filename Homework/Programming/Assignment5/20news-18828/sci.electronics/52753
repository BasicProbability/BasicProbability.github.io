Im trying to figure out how to operate a Pioneer Laserdisc LD1000 that I bought at a surplus store It is reputedly from some kind of computerised viewing
andor ordering system THere is what may be an HPIB connector on the back When
I power it up the front panel power light comes on but no activity and the
door doesnt open Anyone have any experience with this unit or any ideas on how
to obtain documentation

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game Dragons Lair
Space Ace etc Call Pioneer Technicial Support 2134980300 at least
thats the number I called them at and ask for the LDV1000 Interface
Guide It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes
for the commands play pause reject etc The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer but with a little work you could build a wired
controller
