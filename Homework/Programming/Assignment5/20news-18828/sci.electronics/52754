 1 Dont use big capacitors  They are unreliable for timing due to
 leakage 

	True especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature

 Instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by 2 40 times
 or something like that

 Wouldnt a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that as a
mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant frequency

	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz and THESE
have significant temperature drifts which one doesnt often notice
while wearing the watch on ones wrist  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency 1 MHz or so and take more
battery power  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate but they
are more powerstingy than suitable crystal oscillators
