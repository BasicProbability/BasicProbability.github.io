 I am somewhat familiar with the dB measurements as they apply to  
 electrical circuits  ie it is the gain of for example an amplifier  
 measured on a logarithmic scale  However this requires that you have a  
 reference value  ie the ouput is 20dB eg with respect to the input  
 signal

 What you actually talking about here is dBm and not dB  However the terms
 are used loosely by most people  dBm is power with respact to 1mW whereas
 dB is a ratio  Now like these two English statement

 1  I am doing well
 2  I am doing good
 
 Similarly people usually use dB for dBm Another common mistake is spelling
 db instead of dB as you did in your article See the B is for 
 Bell company the mother of ATT and should be capitalized
 
                           With highest regards

Good gravy Decibels are all ratios The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used Sometimes this will be a reference
power such as 1 milliwatt given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance leading to an accepted
notation of dBm Maybe it might be dBV disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed using 1 volt as reference amplitude
rather than reference power Or it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation leading to just plain dB
So look at it this waydB has an implied reference while notation
such as dBm has an explicit reference

For power

  dB  10log PmeasuredPreference 

For amplitude

  dB  20log AmeasuredAreference 

B is for bel which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10 named after Alexander Graham Bell A deci Bel is 110 of a bel
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founders name The small dlarge B is per SI notation
convention I dont know anyone thats been crucified for messing it up

Common references for audio are

	0 dBm  1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV  1 volt

	0 VU a zero on the VU meter  4 dBm  pro gear line level
	0 VU  10dBV	consumer gear line level


Often times a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment

Note that in a circuit with a given and maybe unknown linear
impedance if the amplitude goes up so many decibels the
power will also increase the same amount This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohms law
