  My moms 25 Magnavox does this as well  I put chewing gum all around
  the horizontal sync transformer so it wouldnt resonate the board as
  much  Dont flame it worked  I realize that there is a more suitable
  substance available for this purpose but I dont remember what and
  where it is
  
  Adhesive silicon from hardware store
  
  If it smells like vinegar it may damage metal surfaces by
  promoting corrosion  
 
 Anybody tried Superglue cyanoacrylate   This should sneak
 into the cracks better and is stiffer than silicone  

Ive found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
transformer cores and windings the 60Hz kind Likewise if
anybody has tried this on a flyback Id like to hear about it

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldnt damp as wellsomething
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved in other
words you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
real difficult at 15 KHz
