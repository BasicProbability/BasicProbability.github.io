Subject Re Wanted A to D hardware for a PC

In 3889ncrmpdFtCollinsCONCRCOM Brad Wright writes

	If you know much about PCs IBM comp you might try the joystick
port  Though I havent tried this myself Ive been told that the port
has built in AD converters  This would allow the joystick to be a couple of 
pots  If you could find the specs this might just work for you

I guess 100k connecting pins 13 1x 16 1y 911 2x and 913 2y

Or Get an 8bit DAConverter merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure connect them to a spared printer port if you have one and do
the rest by software stepwise refinement The port addresses for your
printer ports are probably H378 LPT1 H278 LPT2 This should work
well enough for your purposes

Hope this helps
