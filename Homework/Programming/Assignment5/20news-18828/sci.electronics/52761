	If you know much about PCs IBM comp you might try the joystick
port  Though I havent tried this myself Ive been told that the port
has built in AD converters  This would allow the joystick to be a couple of 
pots  If you could find the specs this might just work for you

I believe that the AD converters found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an RC circuit the R being your
paddle to charge up to something like 12 Vcc  For games this works
pretty well but you certainly wouldnt want to try to take lab
measurements off something as nonlinear as that

Hmm I suppose you could linearize it in software but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant higher
voltages would be more precise

On the other hand I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra 50 to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp  But I wouldnt expect that
