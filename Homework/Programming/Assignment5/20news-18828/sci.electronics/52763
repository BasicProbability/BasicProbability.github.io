  Nope  The dag is on the outside of the tube and is grounded  The inside
  aluminization is the second anode and is connected to the anode
  suction cup  This with the glass of the tube in between is a capacitor
  and is used as the power supply bypassfilter for the HV supply  Some
  smaller scope tubes dont have an aquadag coating on the outside  If they
  are in mumetal shields you still have a capacitor
 
 Actually and I think I said this in the original but perhaps wasnt clear
 enough there is usually both an internal AND an external dag  Of the two
 the internal dag is the more important the aluminization of the back of the
 phosphor is in most cases not adequate to guarantee connection to the anode
 button and in the case where the gun assembly includes an accelerating
 electrode at anode potential most definitely does not provide THAT 
 connection

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating is referred to as a
dag as well as the outer coating

Thankfully I didnt need to go to a f library to find it either
One sparkling water for Mr Vanderbyl no caffeine in that is there
