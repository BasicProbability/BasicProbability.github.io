Subject Re Info on NEC 3D Multisync monitor

  I am looking for any info I can get on the NEC 3D monitor
  I know that it is a multisync but that is about all
  I plan on buying one secondhand in a while depending on its specs
  
  Does anyone know the minmax frequencies whether it is interlaced 
  noninterlaced or both video compatability etc
  I have seen a reference to it being 28 pitch with 1024 X 720 resolution 
  and that it supports SVGA from one source and that it doesnt support 
  SVGA from another source  Neither source seemed to have much reliable 
  info so I dont want to take a guess
 
 Im at home right now and so am away from my monitor files the following
 is off the top of my head subject to revision worthwhatyapayforit
 sort of info  If you dont hear from anyone who has spec sheet in hand
 email me and Ill look it up
 
 If Im remembering correctly the 3D is a 14 028 mm pitch multisync that
 covers at least VGA 315 kHz horizontal 60 Hz vertical to 1024 x 768 
 60 Hz which is going to be about 48 kHz horizontal  It may go somewhat
 higher than that on the horizontal but you wont be happy with anything
 beyond 1024 x 768 on a 14 028 tube you probably wont be too thrilled
 with the 1024 x 768 on this tube but it will sync up and display it
 I prefer at least a 16 028 for this resolution  Since SVGA is 800x600
 itll do that too  The horizontal range probably goes lower than 315 but
 I dont know if it goes all the way down to straight NTSCrate TV which need
 about 1575 kHz sweep  As far as video compatibility if Im reading
 the question right it wont take anything but analog RGB inputs  In other
 words it has no way to decode NTSC or YC video inputs  You would need
 some sort of board to to this conversion  like the sorts of things that 
 let you display NTSC on a VGA display
 
 Hopefully now Ill see this response of mine and itll remind me to
 look this stuff up and confirm it  Or force me to post a hasty retraction

Ok I was under the impression that it accepted digital input

I still dont know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and 
noninterlaced as I have gotten conflicting info
