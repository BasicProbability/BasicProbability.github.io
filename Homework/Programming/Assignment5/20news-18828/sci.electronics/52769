Subject Re Homebuilt PAL EPLD programer

Anyone know a reasonable circuit for programming PALs  I am interested
in programming a wide range of EPLDs but would be happy with something 
that could handle a 22V10 or thereabouts

I too would be interested in ANY information on the subject of programing
PALS etc

  Better to know what your on about before you start something I always
say Often saves you a packet as well 

Thanks in advance
