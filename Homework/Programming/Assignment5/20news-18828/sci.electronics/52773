 	Ive been wanting to build a Tesla coil for quite awhile now 
 who doesnt right  and I thought it would be a good intermidiate
 step to build a JAcobs Ladder first
 	Well I have been looking for a high voltage transformer that
 is reasonable inexpensive  neon sign transformers cost mucho 


In the past Ive managed to buy used neon sign transformers from sign shops 
for about 20 Try calling around
