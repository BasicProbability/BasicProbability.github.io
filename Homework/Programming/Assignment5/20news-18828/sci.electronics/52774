 Instead use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by 2 40 times
 or something like that
 Wouldnt a crystal be affected by cold My gut feeling is that as a
mechanically resonating device extreme cold is likely to affect the
compliance terminology of the quartz and hence its resonant frequency
 
Yes but in a fairly reproducible way 40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero And in any case youre going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to testcalibrate this
darling anyway Btw youre probably going to want those big capacitors
you found to fire the solenoid  High current drain on frozen batteries
can be an ugly thing
