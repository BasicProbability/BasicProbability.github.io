  Question 2
  
  	If I am right about the dopplerif I spell it different every time
  maybe one will be right effect how does the radar get an accurate reading
  when the car containing it is moving  It would seem to me  for all thats
  worth that it would need to be calibrated with the speedometer of the car
  containing it  I am fairly sure this isnt the case so whats the deal
 
 Essentially this is actually how it is done  The radar gun is tied into
 the speedometer of the car

No it is independent of the speedometer The gun processes two doppler
returnsthe speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
of the target taking the difference between the two Some guns with
a moving mode actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
preferentially at the pavement

Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar but it was back in
1985 I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
radarmeasured ticket It detailed moving mode which is easier to
defend against because of the increased amount of variables
