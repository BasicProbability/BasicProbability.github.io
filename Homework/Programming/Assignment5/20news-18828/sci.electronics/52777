I assume these are appropriate newsgroups for this question  I am looking

Im really looking for something very much on the applications side
I want to look into it as my new hobby so I need all the direction
I can get  Any comments would be welcome too

Im looking to build a DSP for guitar processing Hence lots of background
information would be really useful 

If anyones got any info could they email

Thanks in advance
