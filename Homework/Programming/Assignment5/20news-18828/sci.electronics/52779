  The beam is split in two with one beam aimed at the target car sort of and
  the other at the ground  The speeds of each are calulated for the final
  number
 
 Actually this is true on the more expensive ones but the cheaper ones
 just read the speedometer

Ive never seen a speedometerreading model Are you sure Who makes
them Consider the difficulty of reading the speedo on various makes
of cars in use Ive seen single beam movingmode and split beam
movingmode
