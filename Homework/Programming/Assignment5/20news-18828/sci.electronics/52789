I got a question from my dad which I really cant answer and Id appreciate
some netwisdom

His question is about some 1824 diameter balls which are attached to
electric power lines in his area  Hes seen up to a half dozen between
two poles  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles

Anyone know what they really are  Is there a related FAQ for this
Is there a better group to submit to

Wed both appreciate some enlightenment


 The balls are used to reduce the amplitude of oscillations of the wire during
periods of high winds  Ive seen what looks like paint cans filled with
concrete used for the same purpose
