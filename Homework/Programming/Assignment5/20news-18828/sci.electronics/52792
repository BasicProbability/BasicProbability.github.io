  Thus a deciBell deci l tenth of  Bell is a fractional part of the
  original Bell  For example SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell
 
 Out of what hat did you pull this one  dB is a ratio not an RBOC
 
  And the measure of current Amp is actually named after both the AMP company
  and the Amphenol company  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
  simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets
  were affected by the amount of current running through the wires
 
 Sorry  The unit for current is the AMPERE which is the name of a frenchman
 named AMPERE who studied electrical current  The term AMP is just an abbreviation
 of it  The company AMP came after the AMPERE unit was already in use
 
  The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers
  thus our use of the Ohms
 
 I dont know about this one but it doesnt sound right
 
 
  Alexander Graham Bell actually is where Bell came from
 Well you got one thing right
 

Actually I think J Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly However decibel is in fact 110th of a bel He is
right on that one but I dont know if it was accidental or not

Strictly defined a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels
and a decibel is 110th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel
hence bellogP2P1 and decibel10XlogP2P1

The bel ohm volt farad ampere watt hertz henry etc are
all named for pioneers in the field Its a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently 1960s prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps
All the other units were defined many decades earlier
