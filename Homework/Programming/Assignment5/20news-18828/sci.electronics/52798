Subject How to kill AC inductive load spiking

Is there a fast n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when
an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zerocrossing of
the AC cycle  A capacitor kludged in somehow etc

Ive got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps
in a big instrument washer and almost everything is being switched with
zerocrossing solid state relays so that stuff stays quiet ACwise
But theres one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay
in the water tank fillthermostat system and its not under control
of my SSRs and it does sometimes generateradiate a spike that resets
one of my peripheral chips  My software times out and tries again but
Id love to just tack in a magic spikekilling fix that would avoid having
to do some major rewiringredesign  A varistor would help but might not
be sufficient  Ideas
