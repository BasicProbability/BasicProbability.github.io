   The beam is split in two with one beam aimed at the target car sort of and
   the other at the ground  The speeds of each are calulated for the final
   number
  
  Actually this is true on the more expensive ones but the cheaper ones
  just read the speedometer
 
 Ive never seen a speedometerreading model Are you sure Who makes
 them Consider the difficulty of reading the speedo on various makes
 of cars in use Ive seen single beam movingmode and split beam
 movingmode

Obviously the police officer reads the speedometer
I cannot believe the nitpicking in this group
Theres 2 beams there is not is too etc
