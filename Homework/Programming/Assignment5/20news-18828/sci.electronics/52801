 I might add that collecting last years data books or even ones two years out
 of date is usually pretty cheap and has benefits besides  You usually DONT
 want to base a design on a brandnew chip  There may be bugs availability may
 be limited the data sheets may be missing critical information that will show
 up in the ap notes in next years data books  Kinda like buying Version 10 of
 a major new software package  Sometimes you get lucky but dont count on it

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
yearsobsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials

When a part is dropped from future production planning such as the
National MMseries white noise generators camera sync generators etc
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time or be available from stock somewhere Now if you
have some old plans calling for such a device or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it youll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere for
example

  In summary read READ READ Thats how youll know what to
  design in which parts to use and how to solve the intractable problem
  that your boss has presented you with 
 
 It helps to have a prodigous memory for details
