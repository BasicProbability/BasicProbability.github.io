	If you know much about PCs IBM comp you might try the joystick
port  Though I havent tried this myself Ive been told that the port

I believe that the AD converters found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an RC circuit the R being your
paddle to charge up to something like 12 Vcc  For games this works
pretty well but you certainly wouldnt want to try to take lab
measurements off something as nonlinear as that

The best info I have seen so far is the article Joystick Metrics
Measuring physical properties through the PCs joystick port by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things voltage current resistance in
BASIC and even includes code for a simple oscilloscope display

Its possible to read the joystick port directly if you dont want to
use BASIC  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions but thats a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr Dobbs Circuit Cellar Ink
etc  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive

Good Luck
