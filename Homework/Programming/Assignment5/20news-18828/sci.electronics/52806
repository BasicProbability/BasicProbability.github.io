Subject Peltier Effect Heat Pumps


I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components  For those who have not heard of this effect you put a
current through one of these devices and it pumps heat from one side
to the other  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well

Anyway it struck me that you could make a nice coolhot box for
picnics with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks  The biggest device can shift 60W with an
efficiency of 8090 which aint bad although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour

Unfortunately the catalogue didnt list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump  I imagine that you would get a backEMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases  If so presumably
its power decreases as the backEMF increases until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no
leakage  If so then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
although that would be a lousy way to control it

What I would like to know is

1 Are the above guesses correct

2 What is the opencircuit thermal resistance of a typical device
   I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it

3 How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work  It looks like
   magic

4 Why dont they use these things in domestic fridgesfreezers


Thanks in advance
