Subject Electric power line balls

I got a question from my dad which I really cant answer and Id appreciate
some netwisdom

His question is about some 1824 diameter balls which are attached to
electric power lines in his area  Hes seen up to a half dozen between
two poles  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles

Anyone know what they really are  Is there a related FAQ for this
Is there a better group to submit to

Wed both appreciate some enlightenment
