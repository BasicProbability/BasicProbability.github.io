Subject Re Jacobs Ladder

Hi all
 Ive been following this thread about jacobs ladder for a few weeks and I
happened to come across one of the best project books that Ive seen in a 
while  The book Gadgeteers Goldmine by Gordon McComb offers over 55 
excellent low cost projects including Jacobs Ladder tesla coils plasma 
spheres a Van de Graaff generator robots an IR scope and several laser 
projects  The instructions come with complete part lists warnings and 
diagrams  For those of you who are interested in building any of the above 
listed projects you should seriously consider getting this book  The 
paperback version is only 1995 too
