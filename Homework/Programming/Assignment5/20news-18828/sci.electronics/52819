Subject Re Police radarJust how does it work

The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases     No foolin  He can guess a cars speed to within 23mph just  
by watching it blow by  whether hes standing still or moving too  Yes  

1 How was this testing done and how many times  Calibrated speedometer

2 Its not the some cases that worry me its the other cases 

eg suboptimal viewing conditions even the best subjective viewer can only
partial compensate for certain distortions and optical illusions
