Subject Re What is Zero dB

 The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus

I dont know about this one but it doesnt sound right

DAMN RIGHT it doesnt  Ohms come from the greek letter omega which
is used for resistanceimpedance

Of course the original poster MAY have been being facetious lets hope
so
