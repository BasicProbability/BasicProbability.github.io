 I got a question from my dad which I really cant answer and Id appreciate
 some netwisdom
 
 His question is about some 1824 diameter balls which are attached to
 electric power lines in his area  Hes seen up to a half dozen between
 two poles  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution
 My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
 inductance of the grid but why so many between two poles
Ill bet theres a runway nearby
