Does anybody out there have a circuit that will decode a 1000Hz tone

Use a NE567 tone decoder PLL chip

My impression  its not an area Ive played with much  is that the
muchbeloved NE567 is basically obsolete  If you want to detect a 1kHz
tone set a switchedcapacitor filter chip to that frequency feed your
input to it and see if anything comes out the other end  The NE567 was
what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do nowadays
theyre easy and the results are better
