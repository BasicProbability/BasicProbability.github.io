As for Adcoms Mobil They are going with amps that canb use Balanced Inputs a
VERY nice toy but Im afraid its goig to push their amps beyound resonable
price ranges  especialy because taking advantage of those balanced inputs
requires a 120 RCA to Balanced adapter

Umm when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living I used to get direct boxes which convert
unbalanced 14 jacks to balanced XLRs for about 25 each or a little more for higher
quality Youll need two for a stereo signal of course and a little adapter thingy from 
Radio Sht to convert from RCA to 14 Total cost should be around 50 You can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself Total cost there should be under 30
You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear
The benefit NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs even when you run them in bad places like next to power lines
