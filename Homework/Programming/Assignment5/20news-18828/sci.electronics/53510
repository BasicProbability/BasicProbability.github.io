 Folks
 
 Here in the Dallas area I have noticed that it is quite common to see an odd
 sensor on top of traffic lights  These have been here for at least six
 years  Ive often wondered what they are

Here in Erie PA there is a system in the inner city called RadoLite a 
trade name which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of 
way by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals  The receivers 
look much like what you describe but they include a UHF whip antenna less
than a foot tall and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that 
an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching  Local folklore 
says this system was invented here I dont know if this company has any 
other installations  It has been in operation for at least 30 years going 
only by my memory
