	Also I dont have time to get the FAQ onto the scianswers
	because of what I like to refer to is red tape  after the

	of an FTP site that wouldnt mind a 250K file 

	And last I have some new entries for the SIMUSOFT list mostly
	commercialinstitutional stuff but was wondering should I keep

	Take care
