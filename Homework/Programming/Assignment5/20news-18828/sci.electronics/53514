Subject Re Uninterruptible Power Supply

Im no expert at UPSs but you said something that made it sound like
you didnt realize something  On a typical UPS well on ours anyway
there is NO switchover from AC to DC  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries via an inverter with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge  If the power fails big deal  
the computers never see it until the batteries start to droop but 
theres something like 60 carsized batteries in that cabinet so it 
takes a while

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter
why not do it all the time  Then thered be no switchover to screw
things up and no having to sense the failure fast  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on and itll be there in zero time when
you need it

Just some ideas  Cant guarantee whatll work or not but hope at least
SOME of this helped
