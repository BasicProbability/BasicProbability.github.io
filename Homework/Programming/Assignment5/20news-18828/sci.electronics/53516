Subject Re Can Microwaves Be Used To Collect XYZ Coordinates

 It seems reasonable to me that a microwave transmitterreceiver setup could 
 do the job For example say you want to map an acre lot itd be convenient
 to place MW transmitters around the lots periphery either 2 or 3 and then
 carry a handheld recorder and walk to a point on the lot press a button and
 the coords of the recorders location is stored as digital data
 
 Whats the chance of this working Any systems like this already exist
 What kind of accuracy could you expect What would something like this
 cost to prototype Is there a better alternative than microwaves

Of course you could develope this system but there is already a system called Global
Positioning Satellites  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth 
Many surveyors use this system with a differential receivertransmitter to get
coordinates within centimeters  Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters on
a good day are available from many sources
