	I have a new scope and I thought Id save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in

Hmm now where was that ad for the combination radiohand cranked
generatorflashlightsiren I saw 

function generator has a 50mV offset and the amplitudes too high

	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem The box would tkae the function generator
input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low unchanging number I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so I could just build a little buffer amp but Id
like to have this box not be active

Sure youve already got the right idea

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just
run it into say a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1100 of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the exact dividing ratio or
the availability of parts

Hows that sound

PS  This is why those 10001 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k which doesnt load the often high impedence source much as well as
keeping the probably 10 meg impedance multimeter happy
