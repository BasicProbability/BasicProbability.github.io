Subject How do DI boxes work


Im doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct
Input boxes for the keyboards  These are the little boxes that take a
line level out of the keyboard and transform it into lowZ for the run
to the mixer  Sadly they cost like 50 or more each and Im going
to need like 5 or 10 of them  I looked inside one belonging to
another band and it looks like just a transformer  Does anyone have
any plans for building them  Perhaps in Andertons Electronic
Projects for Musicians book which I am having a hell of a time
tracking down

Thanks a lot
