What happens when DVC Digital Videon Compression is introduced next 
year and instead of just receiving squiggly lines on 2 or 3 channels 
well be receiving sqigglies on lets see 310  30 channels eventually

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carriertonoise ratio below which it degrades very quickly  Hence
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV
