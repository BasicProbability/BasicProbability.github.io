Subject Re Where to buy parts 1 or 2 at a time

The pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me

A gram of this dye costs a dollar
It comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar
And if you want a whole barrel of it that also costs a dollar

Ie they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
it to you  the chemical itself in that particular case was a byproduct
that cost almost nothing intrinsically
