Subject Re electronic odometers

I had the insturment panel go out in my car a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal which
is a digital dash They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash thank god it
was under the warrenty   Anyway the odometer was reading the exact milage
from the old panel It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is updated
Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it but it doesnt So I
guess they swapped the NVM chip nonvolitile memory and installed it in the
new dash No they wouldnt let me have the old dash to tinker with
