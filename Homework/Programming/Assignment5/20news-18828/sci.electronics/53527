Im wanting to build a simple UPS for my PC  sustain the computer long enough to complete 
the current task and save 5 to 10 minutes should be enough
I think though I dont really need to keep the monitor active I can try to 
remember what to do so maybe I can avoid a DCAC inverter and just use a 
battery to directly supply the motherboard and peripherals

Now theres a good idea  All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes and
a good wetware memory was I using wp or autocad or  I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago Ive got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping and it sits around useless when Im home
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with or use it with a heavy
duty 5volt regulator to supply the PC But I guess youd need 5v and 12v 
and 12 too 2 more batteries 

An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time and when the power
goes out voila  the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery  and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips
