Subject MICROPHONE PREAMPLOW NOISEPHANTOM POWERED

Im looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good lownoise characteristics  large clean gain and incorportates phantom power 2048 volts dc for a PZM microphone  Im leaning towards a good lowcost  instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone for its good CMRR internal compensation and because i can use a minimal  of parts  

Does anyone out there have any experience suggestions advice etcthat theyd like to pass on Id greatly appreciate it
