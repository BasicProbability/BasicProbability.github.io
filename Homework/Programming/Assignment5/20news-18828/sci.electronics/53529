	I was wondering if people had any good uses for old
256k SIMMs  I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac
and I know lots of other people do to  I have tried to
sell them but have gotten NO interest

	So if you have an inovative use or want to buy
some SIMMs  8  I would be very interested in hearing
about it

One of the guys at work takes 20 of them uses cyanoacrylate glue to make
five fourwide panels then constructs a box with bottom to use as a
pencil holder


Or if youve got some entreprenuerial sp spirit get a cheapy
clear plastic box mount the simm inside and sell it as a Pet SIMM

Im sure there are plenty of suckers out there who would go
for it
