Initial symptoms
no picture or sound
CRT filament does NOT glow
flyback ticking as described abovew

Discovered when hooked up the scope
IF strip is not putting out audio or video signals
everything is making simple 2030 Hz pulses
horiz out transistor collector case of the TO3 is a 2030 Hz downgoing
  sawtooth with ca 15kHz ring at front end

guys WHATS GOING ON HERE  Anyone seen this before

What is happening is this
1 You turn the TV on
2 The horizontal output begins normal operation  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry
3 A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down
4 After it powers down the cycle repeats

Things to check
First check for a shorted high power component  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistors or if there is one the voltage regulator  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere
Also look for shutdown circuits which your TV may or may not have
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldnt be too hard to find the problem from there
