any chip i need I dont want to hunt down all the chips I may need so
it would be greatly appreciated if anyone knows of a good distributor

thankyou

Unfortunately there are not too many retail outlets thatll stock
just about every chip made  The stuff they will stock are the ones
thatll sell like standard DRAMs 80386s 68000s etcetc
ie  I cnat think of any onestopshopping store

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar Popular Electronics and the like and flip
through them

Distributors like Wyle Electronics Hamilton Avnet Pioneer Electronics
etc etc dont normally deal with endusers like ourselves where
we only a couple of everythingthey only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different noncompeting manufacturers  What do I mean by this
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386s  Its a pretty good
bet that they wont be selling any of AMDs 386s or viceversa
They also can obtain just about any chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent

Who knows  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them
But Id be suprised if you do  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be much greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge

My advice  If youre gonna be designing anything try to stick
with offtheshelf stuff  Youre going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later

good luck
