Subject need ACS tutorial andor netlist examples


I recently ftpd Als Circuit Simulator ACS and Im looking for
the tutorial which is mentioned in the Users Manual but not found there
I dont have any experience constructing a netlist such as for SPICE
and I need a little help

The examples which come with ACS arent explanatory about the translation
between schematic and netlist Does anyone have the fabled Tutorial
or any other reference which could help me in constructing a netlist from
a schematic diagram

I also emailed Al himself but received no response yet Hes probably
 busy with his next release
