Subject Cheap LCD panels  seeking info

Attention hardware hackers and bargain seekers

I just bought a 640x200 pixel LCD panel for 25 UK pounds  I have
a datasheet for a similar panel but Im looking for proper data

If anyone can help with locating data for this device before I start
with the routine on the phone to Hitachi and rummaging through the
library then Ill pass on the source

	Type LM225 Hitachi
	Resolution 640W x 200H so can do 80x25 chars on 8x8 matrix

Bought from

	Greenweld Electronics Ltd
	27 Park Rd
	Southampton SO1 3TB UK

	Tel 44 703 23 63 63
	Fax 44 703 23 63 07
	Email Compuserve 1000141463

NB I only just bought this  I dont even know if it works

	Price was 25 UK pounds including VAT 175 which isnt
	payable if youre outside the EC

Thanks for any info


Chris
