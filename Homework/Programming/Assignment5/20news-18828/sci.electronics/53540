 	I was wondering if people had any good uses for old
 256k SIMMs  I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac
 and I know lots of other people do to  I have tried to
 sell them but have gotten NO interest

We use them as Christmas tree decorations the cat doesnt eat these

Yes but they dont look appropriate  I much prefer used 833 tubes on
my tree
