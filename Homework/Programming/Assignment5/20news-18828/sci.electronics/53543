Subject Where to find CHEAP LCD displays

SciEE netters

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine I have ordered a PIC ICE not vice versa since the PICs are so 
cheap and lowpower but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 68 digit range that are priced as low as I need  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of 1 in quantities of about 
100010000

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a 15 8digit LCD  Even Digikeys cheapest offering is 5 in 
quantity

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for 499 meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for 350 and the wholesaler probably gets it for 250 or so  This 
250 includes assembly labor packaging sales transportation 
import duties the case and keyboard the PC Board the processor 
chip the solar cell  and the LCD  The LCD cant cost much

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers andor 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged

PS  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled  Has anyone else 
had better luck with this strategy
