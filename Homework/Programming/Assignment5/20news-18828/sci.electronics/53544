Subject Amplifier into CDROM earphone plug 

We have a Sun CDROM drive which I would like to play audio CDs in
I have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to a
junk Walkman style AMFM radio This amp ties the common path of the
earphone connection to ground

However it doesnt work with my Sony Walkman cassette player or the CD drive
it produces of loud lowfrequency tone Obviously Sony doesnt ground
the earphone output common Does anyone have specs on the CD drives 
output Will an audio transformer help What are others using to
play there CDs in the Sun drive so that more than one can listen

Thanks for the help
