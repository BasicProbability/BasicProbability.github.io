So the questions are 
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect
  Would additional shieldinggroundingbypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna
  Are any brands quieter than others

Ok so your a HAM   Well tune in 107Mhz or 455Khz  These numbers sound 
like some you have herd before   Thats right you guessed it they are 
common IF numbers   Every SuperHet receiver has a local oscillators
which generates an IF  This is what your detector detector is detecting the
local oscillator 

Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
receiver you  If you want to receiver something at say 10525Ghz you must 
generate a local oscillator signal of 10525Ghz  107Mhz  your local osc
frequency  This 107Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt  
The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage your mileage may vary  Since
the AGC is a negative feed back device a positive voltage sets off a 
I think you get the picture
