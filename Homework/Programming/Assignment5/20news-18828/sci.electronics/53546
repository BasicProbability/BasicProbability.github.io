Subject subliminal message flashing on TV



Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
TV screen at 1200ths of a second  Is that possible  I thought the
maximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 130th
of a second  or 160th of a second for an image composed of only odd
or even scan lines
