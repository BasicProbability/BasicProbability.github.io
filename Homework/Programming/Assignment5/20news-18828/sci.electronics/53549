Thats scary  if theres a way to set an arbitrary mileage figure
into the odometer you cant trust any odometer reading even
if you can prove that the odometer itself is the same one that
came on the car originally

  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these
electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage  What kind of
memory is stablereliable enough nonvolatile enough and independent enough
of outside battery power to last say 10 years or more in the life of a
vehicle  Im amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for
this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that
are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow

Side question  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with
a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles after say 100200300K
actual miles  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy  for the price of a
new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the
buyer it has

Thanks for any insight
