Subject data pods 10248B for HP logic analyzer 1615A

Anyone out there in netland have a spare data pod or two from an old 
1615A Hewlett Packard logic analyzer  If you do Id like to buy it off
of you  The pods part number is 10248B

As a side note anyone know of any good surplus dealer or other organization
that would carry wayward logic analzer pods
