Subject Scope questions


	Greetings Ive been seeing the word storage mentioned
	around oscilliscopes but Im curious what does it mean

	If my life depended on it Id say that its a scope that
	uses longpersistance phosphor to keep the successive
	taces on the screen for some unit of time  store them
	Do I get to live

	Also Ive been shopping for a decent used old scope
	since my Tek 514A portableNOT and my Heathkit O1000
	are all single trace and I need more like 2 or 3 and at
	least 50MHz maybe 100

	During my shopping at hamfests etc Ive run into the 
	problem of old scope terminology I can imagine what
	a mainframe and plugin are but some things like
	the above storage coax input Hey where do I get a 
	probe that fits this I had to fiddle with mine for a week 
	before I got anything resembling a good trace  they all
	come with BNC connectors unblanking huh and oh
	just like my 514 manuals MANY changes were made along the
	way to the schematic  scopes even with IDENTICAL model 
	numbers have different better responseperformance than
	others  how can I pick the better one Does the rule of the
	higher SN the better apply

	Take care
