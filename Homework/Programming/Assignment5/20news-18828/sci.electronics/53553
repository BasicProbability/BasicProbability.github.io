 Hello
 	Ive got a problem with my CD player SONY CDP35 in that it refuses
 to play discs  more than a minor inconvenience  The player itself doesnt
 recognise that there is a disc in  Its an intermitant problem but one 
 that is becoming more frequent
 
 	Is this a common problem with older CD players and if so what
 can be done to rectify it   If there is no obvious answer how can I begin to 
 start fault finding  To start off with How does thet mach recognise that 
 there is a disc in in the first place 


My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose and the CD either skips
or cant be read  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer
assembly are tightened properly  Other than that my next guess would be one of
the motors  Hope this helps
