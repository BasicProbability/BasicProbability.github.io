  Just a thought of mine here
  Since an onhook line is aprox 4850V and offhook it usually drops below 1
  How about an LED in series with a zener say around 30V
  Onhook  LED on
  Offhook  LED off
  Would this work If anyone triestried it please let me know
 
  Aye theres the rub  if you draw enough current to light an LED the
  equipment at the phone company will think youve gone off hook
  In the onhook state youre not supposed to draw current
 
 Which means you should just use your Digital VoltMeter You can use an
 old VOM but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think
 theres something wrong with the cable
 
 
 Look Guys whats the problem here  If you want a light that goes on when 
 the phone is Off hook all you need it to run it in series with the 
 line as I mentioned in my previous post  If you want a light that goes on 
 when the phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold detector

If youre going to do the series Diode thing which is the easiest just
make sure that the LED can take the current I cant recall it offhand but
its something like 100mA or more

Careful now folks Also consider the 90VAC 20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phones supposed to ring  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup you might end up with some carbon real quick  Whatever
scheme you use make sure youve got at least 200Vrated components on 
the frontend

Also remember that if Im not mistaken the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms  Thats fine until youre down to roughly
12V when Ma Bell considers it to be offhook  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big nono

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above

    tip  
              rectifier  resistor            
              diode                           
                                   V          
                          zener            resistor
                                             
                                             
                                             V   LED
                                            
                                             
    ring 

This is only a suggestiongo ahead and blow holes in it but you
get the idea  Choose a highefficiency LED so you dont need much
current to get it to light up  Choose values for the other components
as required
