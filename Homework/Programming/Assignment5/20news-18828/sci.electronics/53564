Subject Hard Drive Component Costs

  Does anyone have some information on the relative fraction of the final
cost of each component in an average hard drive  For instance Im pretty
sure the heads and the platters are the most expensive parts with the
assembly costs running a close third  Cost of the electronics is likely
in the noise
  Any hard numbers  or percentage  Thanks
