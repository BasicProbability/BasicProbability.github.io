 In article 34263oasysdtnavymil you write
 VA CT Wash DC  and I think BC Canada where Ive heard they actually
 use Radar detector detectors
 
 Nope not in British Columbia  Detectors are legal here in BC Ive even
 got one
 
 In Alberta and Ontario theyre illegal and detection devices are sometimes
 used  Ive heard the police in Ontario prefer a much more direct method of
 detection  Just trigger the radar gun watch for people slamming on the
 brakes and search the car

They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I dont know what 
methods are used to detect them

It has always amazed me with the way the laws work  It is not illegal to 
sell them here in Manitoba only to have them within a vehicle  Last I 
heard they dont have to be installed to be illegal
