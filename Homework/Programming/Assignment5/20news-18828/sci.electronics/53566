 Hello
 Im considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and
 I need a little advice on outlet wiring  Several outlets
 are the old two prong type without the ground  Naturally
 the wire feeding these outlets is 122 WITHOUT the ground
 wire  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the
 122 with ground and that on these circuits the ground
 wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire
 
 SO  Heres my question  It seems to me that Id have the
 same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutralDDDDDDDDDDDa jumper from the neutral
 over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets
 Whats wrong with my reasoning here  

First it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection
Secondly The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
shouldnt be or only during a fault condition

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
tranformer on the power pole has a grounded centertap secondary with the
grounded centertap the neutral  This gives 120v to neutralground from
each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer  So in effect
the neutral and ground should be at the same potential
