Subject What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do



I really dont know where to post this question so I figured that
this board would be most appropriate
I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
actual purpose of those things are I hear that theyre called
Cooling Towers but what the heck do they cool
I hope someone can help
