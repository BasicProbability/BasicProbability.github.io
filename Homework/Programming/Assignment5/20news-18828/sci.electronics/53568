Subject Re A question about 120VAC outlet wiring

In article 1993Apr1417214527458ecsvaxuncecsedu crispecsvaxuncecsedu Russ Crisp writes
 Im considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and
 I need a little advice on outlet wiring  Several outlets
 are the old two prong type without the ground  Naturally
 the wire feeding these outlets is 122 WITHOUT the ground
 wire  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the
 122 with ground and that on these circuits the ground
 wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire
 
 SO  Heres my question  It seems to me that Id have the
 same electrical circuit if I hooked the jumper from the neutral
 over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets
 Whats wrong with my reasoning here  

No  No  NOOO

The ground green wire is for safety  No current is supposed to flow in it
under normal conditions  This means that theres normally no voltage drop in
it either  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire even if
youre grounded in some other way at the same time  

The neutral white wire is as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said the return for
the hot wire  Since current flows in it theres a voltage drop  If you
plug a heavy load into a properlywired grounded outlet you can commonly 
measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground  

They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere
repeat NOwhere else  Well almost  There are strange exceptions for things
like subpanels

What you CAN do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  In fact
depending on where you are putting your new outlets a GFCI may be required

There is a FAQ on electrical wiring posted regularly to recwoodworking and
newsanswers  It goes into great detail on these issues including GFCIs and
you should probably read it before asking any more questions  Ill mail a copy
to you append a copy here and will ask the writers to crosspost it here in
the future
