Subject IntroductionDisclaimers

	Although weve done a fair bit of wiring we are not
	electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do  If
	youre at all uncertain about what is correct or safe dont
	do it  Contact someone qualified  a licensed electrician
	or your local electrical inspector  Electricity is no joke
	mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution

	Furthermore our discussion is based on the US National
	Electrical Code NEC and the Canadian Electrical code CEC
	To the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code but we dont quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable  If you think were wrong
	we invite you to correct us but please  quote references

	The NEC and the CEC do not in and of themselves have the
	force of law  Many municipalities adopt it en toto  Others
	however do not  Check your with your local building
	department and provincial Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada to find out what applies in your area  Also
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation  Bear in mind too that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary singlefamily
	residences  Multifamily dwellings mobile homes commercial
	establishments etc are sometimes governed by different
	rules

	Also note that contrary to popular belief in the US and in
	some parts of Canada Canada is not a whollyowned subsidiary
	of the US  Consequently the NEC does not apply in Canada
	Lots of things are the same including voltages line
	frequencies and the laws of physics  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations  Where we can weve
	noted them flagging the relevant passages with NEC or
	CEC

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements

Subject What is the NEC  Where can I get a copy

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association an insurance industry group
	Its revised every three years  The 1993 version has been released
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly
	at 8003443555  The code exists in several versions  Theres the
	full text which is fairly incomprehensible  Theres an abridged
	edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses
	And theres the NEC Handbook which contains the authorized
	commentary on the code as well as the full text  Thats the
	recommended version  Unfortunately theres no handbook for
	the abridged edition  And the full handbook is expensive 
	US65 plus shipping and handling

Subject What is the CEC  Where can I get a copy

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies power utilities insurance
	companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C221 which is updated every two
	or three years  Each province adopts with some amendments
	this standard and publishes a provincespecific code book
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself  In this FAQ CEC really means the
	appropriate provincial standard  In particular this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code 20th
	edition 1990  Which is in turn based on CSA C2211990 16th
	edition  While differences exist between the provinces an
	attempt has been made to avoid specifictoOntario detail

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority  In
	Ontario its Ontario Hydro  The Ontario Hydro book isnt
	overly fat  Its about C25 and includes mailed updates  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications

	Dont bother asking in Quebec  DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province

Subject Can I do my own wiring  Extra pointers

	In most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring
	In some theyre not  Check with your local electrical
	inspector  Most places wont permit you to do wiring on others
	homes for money without a license  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in commercial buildings  Multiple dwellings eg duplexes
	are usually considered semicommercial or commercial  However
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semicommercial
	wiring if youre supervised by a licensed electrician  if you can
	find one willing to supervise

	If you do your own wiring an important point

	Do it NEAT and WELL  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do  After all its your own home
	and its you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake  An electrician has time pressures has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job
	In this FAQ weve consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code because we feel that its reasonable
	and will impress the inspector

	The inspector will know that youre an amateur  You have to
	earn his trust  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible  Dont cut corners
	Exceed specifications  Otherwise the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions

	Dont try to hide anything from the inspector

	Use the proper tools  Ie dont use a bread knife to strip
	wires or twist wires with your fingers  The inspector
	wont like it and the results wont be that safe  And it
	takes longer  And youre more likely to stick a hunk of
	12ga wire through your hand that way

	Dont handle house wire when its very cold eg below 10C
	or 16F  Thermoplastic house wire particularly older types
	become very brittle

Subject What do I need in the way of tools

	First theres the obvious  a hammer a drill a few
	screwdrivers both straight and Phillipshead  If youre 
	lucky enough to live in Canada or find a source of CSAapproved
	devices you need Robertson square recess screwdrivers
	1 and 2 instead of phillips

	For drilling a few holes a 34 or 1 spade bit and 14 or
	38 electric drill will do  If youre doing a lot or
	are working with elderly lumber we recommend a 12 drill
	rightangle drills are wonderful  Can be rented and
	34 or 1 screwpoint auger drill bits  These bits pull
	you through so theyre much faster and less fatiguing even
	in 90 year old hardwood timbers

	Screwdriver bits are useful for drills expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws
	work well
	
	For stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters  Dont buy the 3 Kmart combo stripper
	crimper and bottle opener types  You should expect to pay
	15 to 20 for a good pliertype pair  It will have sized
	stripping holes and wont nick or grab the wire  it should
	be easy to strip wire with it  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals  There
	are fancier types autostripcut but they generally arent
	necessary and pros usually dont use them

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places  Dont use these for stripping wire

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts

	You should have a pair of needlenose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops but its better to form wire
	loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper  more
	accurate

	If youre using nonmetallic cable get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath  Or do what some pros do they nick the
	end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	zipper and cut the sheath off  You shouldnt try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point because its too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades
	can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility
	that youll gouge the conductors

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable its well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter US 18
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation

	Threeprong outlet testers are a quick check for properlywired
	outlets  About 6  Multimeters tell you more but are a lot more
	expensive and probably not worth it for most people  A simple
	voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost
	about US 10 at Radio Shack

	You should have a voltage detector  to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them  Neonbulb version are cheap 23
	and work well  If you get more serious a audible alarm type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper  Though Ive been known
	to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops 

	For running wires through existing walls you need fish tape
	Often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice  Fish tapes can be rented

	Electrical tape  Lots of it   Seriously a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws  I dont do this but drywall contractors prefer it to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate

Subject What is UL listing

	The UL stands for Underwriters Laboratory  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization but now it is independent
	and nonprofit  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards  When something is ULlisted that means
	that the UL has tested the device and it meets their requirements
	for safety  ie fire or shock hazard  It doesnt necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what its supposed to just
	that it probably wont kill you

	The UL does not have power of law in the US  you are
	permitted to buy and install nonULlisted devices  However
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a nonULlisted device  Furthermore in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is ULlisted for that purpose
	Indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be ULlisted before an inspector will approve it andor
	occupancy permits issued
	
Subject What is CSA approval

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSAapproved materials  They perform testing similar to
	the UL a bit more stringent except that CSA approval is
	required by law

	Again like the UL if a fire was caused by nonCSAapproved
	equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim

	In Canada there is a branch organization of the UL called ULC
	UL of Canada  ULC does not have power of law and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies

Subject Are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring

	USA The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell
	    Craftsman Books
	    Carlsbad CA for 1825 ISBN 0934041199

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential Farm and Industrial  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSINFPA 70
	    Herbert P Richter and W Creighton Schwan
	    McGrawHill Book Co

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H P Richter and W C Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision  Which is currently 1990

	Canada PS Knight authors and publishes a book called
	Electrical Code Simplified  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code  It focuses on residential wiring
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIYers  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring or answer
	questions on the net 

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C10

Subject Inspections how and what  Why should I get my wiring inspected

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home dont get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit  California for instance is particularly nasty about
	this

	If fire starts in your home and uninspected wiring is at
	fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims

	In general the process goes like this
		 you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things youre not
		  sure of  If youre doing major work they may impose
		  special conditions on you require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need
		 If youre installing a main panel you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors
		 After installing the boxes and wiring but before
		  the insulationwalls go up you will need a
		  roughin inspection
		 After the walls are up and the wiring is complete
		  you will need a final inspection

Subject My house doesnt meet some of these rules and regulations
	Do I have to upgrade

	In general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings
	though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some
	cases  However any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code  Also if you do major work you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system  Check with your local electrical inspector

Subject A word on voltages 110115117120125220240

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit  One person might talk about 110V another 117V
	or another 120V  These are all in fact exactly the same
	thing  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a splitphase 240 volt 5 feed to your house
	This works out as two 120V  5 legs  Additionally since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring its not
	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped
	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run  For a number
	of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them 110V and
	220V except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be  Confusing  A bit  Just ignore it

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie 110V
	instead of 120V value  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low

	208V is not the same as 240V  208V is the voltage between
	phases of a 3phase Y circuit that is 120V from neutral to any
	hot   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3phase Y
	circuit thats 277V from hot to neutral

	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness motors intended
	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V

Subject What does an electrical service look like

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe
	This is the grounding conductor  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground  This wire
	normally carries no current

	One of the other wires will be white or black with white or
	yellow stripes or sometimes simply black  It is the neutral wire
	It is connected to the centre tap CEC center tap in the
	NEC of the distribution transformer supplying the power  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often
	inside the panel  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else  Otherwise weird andor dangerous things may happen

	Furthermore there should only be one grounding system in
	a home  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode
	These will be connected together or connected to the neutral
	at a common point  still one grounding system  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code

	If you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are
	not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one
	neutralground connection  However in some situations 
	certain categories of separate buildings you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode  consult your
	inspector

	The other two wires will usually be black and are the hot
	wires  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well

	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each
	other  This means if you connect something to both hot wires
	the voltage will be 220 volts  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one
	wire is doing dualduty as both neutral and ground or in some
	rare occasions the service has only one hot wire 110V only
	service

Subject What is a circuit

	Inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home  There are three different combinations
		1 one hot one neutral and ground 110V circuit
		2 two hots no neutral and ground 220V circuit
		3 two hots neutral and ground 220V circuit  neutral
		   andor two 110V circuits with a common neutral

	1 is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house  3 is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers  they
	often have need for both 220V and 110V or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point  2 is
	usually for special 220V motor circuits electric heaters or
	air conditioners

	Note In the US the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to 2 be used for stoves and dryers  namely that there
	are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for 110V purposes  three prong plugs instead
	of four only for stovesdryers connected to the main panel
	When connected to most subpanels 4 prong plugs and receptacles
	are required  In our notsohumble opinion this is crazy but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was reevaluated for the 1992 NEC
	and found to be safe  Check your local codes or inquire as to
	local practice  there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible

	1 is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot
	white for neutral and bare for grounding

	2 and 3 have one hot wire coloured red the other black a
	bare wire for grounding and in 3 a white wire for neutral

	You will sometimes see 2 wired with just a black white and ground
	wire  Since the white is hot in this case both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire  Usually done with paint nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse

	There are in a few locales circuits that look like 1 2
	or 3 except that they have two bare ground wires  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground
	the other attaches to the motor  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection

Subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC the
	grounding conductor is for the safety ground ie the green
	or bare wire  The word neutral is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one hot wire  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel the proper term is grounded conductor  However the
	potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding
	conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes  you should
	never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire
	as the grounding conductor even though they are connected
	together in the panel

	But not in subpanels  subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel  Usually

	In the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used
	for grounded conductor  This FAQ uses neutral simply to
	avoid potential confusion  We recommend that you use neutral
	too  Thus the white wire is always except in some light
	switch applications neutral  Not ground

Subject What does a fuse or breaker do  What are the differences

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels  For
	example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should
	trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting  As
	such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring  UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself wont cause a fire

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit  Fuses trip relatively
	fast  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges  For motor circuits you can use
	a timedelay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads  A fusetron looks like a
	springloaded fuse  A fuse can only trip once then it must be
	replaced

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends  By bending it trips the latch and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons  that is they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses  With high
	overloads they trip quickly  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times  each time they trip or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which
	damages the contacts  Thus breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose

	Neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which
	can often cause severe damage

Subject Breakers  Cant I use fuses

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse
	being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a
	penny trick

	Since breakers are more permanently installed and have better
	connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload  When
	a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path  Result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel
	melted service wiring through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down
	Breakers dont do this

	Many jurisdictions particularly in Canada no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special
	inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses

	Some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload  Check the
	labeling on the unit  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one

Subject What size wire should I use

	For a 20 amp circuit use 12 gauge wire  For a 15 amp circuit
	you can use 14 gauge wire in most locales  For a long run
	though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid
	voltage drops  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	14 gauge though its stiffer and harder to work with

	Heres a quick table for normal situations  Go up a size for
	more than 100 foot runs when the cable is in conduit or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they cant dissipate
	heat easily

		Gauge		Amps
		14		15
		12		20
		10		30
		8		40
		6		65
	
	We dont list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type

Subject Where do these numbers come from

	There are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup
	The smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is  When
	the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring  The former is why you need
	highertemperature insulation andor bigger wires for use in
	conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances
	There are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller
	wire is allowed  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps  Dont try this unless youre certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire

Subject What does 142 mean

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable  The first number specifies the gauge  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire  but
	remember theres usually an extra ground wire  142 means
	14 gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground

	2 wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral  In
	the latter case the sheath is usually red too

	3 wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire
	Usually carrying 220V with neutral

Subject What is a wirenutmarrettemarr connector  How are they
	used

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy thats used
	to connect wires together  Marrette or Marr connector
	are trade names  Youll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring

	In essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them
	together then twist the wirenut on

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you dont need to twist the
	wire do it anyways  its more mechanically and electrically
	secure

	There are many different sizes of wire nut  You should check
	that the wire nut youre using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire youre connecting together

	Dont just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers  Use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly  Sometimes
	its a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly

	Some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape  This is probably not a good idea  the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection  Its usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut  instead
	of taping it the connection should be redone

Subject What is a GFIGFCI

	A GFCI is a groundfault circuit interrupter  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire  If they differ by more than a few milliamps the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person  Any
	of these situations is hazardous so the GFCI trips breaking
	the circuit

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks  If
	for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a GFCI
	wouldnt help  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the
	GFCI happy

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric
	One is labeled LOAD the other LINE  The incoming power feed
	must be connected to the LINE side or the outlet will not be
	protected  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it  Thus a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet

Subject Where should GFCIs be used

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V 15A or 20A single phase
	outlets in bathrooms kitchens within 6 of the sink garages
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or
	just about anywhere else where youre likely to encounter water
	or dampness  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets
	those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space
	typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs  In particular there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or
	basement outlets  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor garage outlets if theyre near the door to
	outside  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection you may
	want to consider installing it anyway  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker see below the cost is low  In the US GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US8  Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada  C12  Evaluate your own risk factors  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet  Do you have small children
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage

Subject Where shouldnt I use a GFCI

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that a dont pose a
	safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time  Refrigerators freezers
	and sump pumps are good examples  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance tripping the GFCI  Note though that most
	GFCI trips are real if youre getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason youd be welladvised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless

Subject What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker

	For most situations you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with
	a builtin GFCI  The former is generally preferred since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive  For example an ordinary GE
	breaker costs US5 the GFCI model costs US35  There is one
	major exception  if you need to protect a multiwire branch
	circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire
	such as a Canadianstyle kitchen circuit youll need a
	multipole GFCI breaker  Unfortunately these are expensive
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on
	what brand of panel box you have  But if you must protect such
	a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice

	One more caveat  GFCI outlets are bulky  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them  On second thought use
	large actually deep boxes everywhere  Youll thank yourself for it

	Incidentally if youre installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you dont
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom and not GFCI anything upstream of it  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred

	When you install a GFCI its a good idea to use the little
	ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI  You can figure out which
	outlets are downstream simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead

Subject Whats the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then

	Apart from their use in electronics which we wont comment on
	and for certain fluorescent lights they wont turn on without
	a good ground connection theyre intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device  Generally the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead  If theres an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs the case is live  and if
	you touch it while youre grounded youll get zapped  Of
	course if the circuit is GFCIprotected it will be a very
	tiny zap  which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets both NEC and CEC

	There are some appliances that should never be grounded  In
	particular that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors  Consider  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster and youre not grounded nothing will
	happen  If youre slightly grounded youll get a small shock
	the resistance will be too high  But if the case were
	grounded and you were holding it youd be the perfect path to
	ground

Subject Why is one prong wider than the other  Polarization

	Nowadays many twoprong devices have one prong wider than the
	other  This is so that the device could rely not guaranteed
	on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the
	the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference ie some radios

	Most 2prong extension cords have wide prongs too

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around  You want the wide prong to be neutral and the
	narrow one hot  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral
	If not you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to

Subject What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen

	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp small appliance
	circuits for kitchens  The CEC requires splitduplex
	receptacles  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than 24 NEC 900 mm CEC from an outlet  Every counter wider
	than 12 NEC or 300 mm CEC must have at least one outlet
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen pantry or dining room  Furthermore these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves
	lighting etc  Nondedicated outlets within 6 of a sink must be
	protected by a GFCI NEC only

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw  When
	carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be
	pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesnt cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets

Subject Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to
	the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture  All such outlets must be GFCIprotected

Subject What is RomexNMNMD  What is BX  When should I use each

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire
	Sometimes called nonmetallic sheath  The formal name is NM
	This is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside
	stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire  There are several
	different categories of NM cable

	BX cable  technically known as armored cable or AC has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm125 CEC  NEC
	from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit

	Note inspectorpermitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection
	but this is technically illegal

	Additional protection recommendations these are rules in the
	Canadian codes  they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the NEC
	and CEC

	     NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor
	      Ie use AC instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc
	     Where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters the wire should be protected  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used
	     Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a 25mm1 air space or suitable insulation
	      material a wad of fiberglass
	     NM cable shall be supported within 300mm1 of every box
	      or fitting and at intervals of no more than 15m5
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered supports
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box  while fishing cable is technically in violation
	      it is permitted where proper support is impractical
	     2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge
	      Knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring
	      to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach
	     cable should never be buried in plaster cement or
	      similar finish
	     cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards
	     Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than 1m 39

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings

	In places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of
	a garage  you may be required to use conduit a
	UL or CSA approved metal pipe  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entranceexit for the
	wire

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit

	In damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will
	need special wire eg CEC NMW90 NEC UF  NMW90 looks like
	very heavyduty NMD90  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire entersexits the ground  See underground
	wiring section

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire such as NM NMW etc should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces   The reason for this
	is that if theres a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius  Eg AC90 versus AC
	In the US NMB is 90 degrees celcius

	NOTE local codes vary  This is one of the items that changes
	most often  Eg Chicago codes require conduit everywhere
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes
	Check your local codes especially if youre doing anything
	thats the slightest out of the ordinary

	uncommon wire types or applications omitted

Subject Should I use plastic or metal boxes

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with nonmetallic cable
	only  The reasoning is simple  with armored cable the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity  US plastic
	boxes dont use metal cable clamps

	The CEC is slightly different  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor  However you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	nonmetallic sheathed cable  you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less  On the other
	hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts  For
	exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better

Subject Junction box positioning

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that theyre accessible
	later  Ie not buried under plaster  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may
	get nasty

Subject Can I install a replacement light fixture

	In general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few
	caveats  First of course one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen 500 watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well  For example older house
	wiring doesnt have hightemperature insulation  The excess
	heat generated by a ceilingmounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only  You may find in fact that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose  A 2x4 across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	pot lamps or heat lamps  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually
	8x16x12  made by making a pair of joists 12 high and covering
	with plywood that doesnt have any insulation  Yes thats 8 feet
	long

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent  They require at least 3
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement
	which means that a CECstyle coffin might be worthwhile
	Presumably thats up to the local inspector  The CEC doesnt
	actually mandate the coffin perse this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture cant get
	accidentally buried in insulation  Ie if you have insulation blown
	in later

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation  They are
	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat
	more expensive than the older types  Before you use them you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses
	Follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation  The coffin appears the only legal approach

Subject What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose  Depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up
	being more than 110V and the other less than 110V with
	respect to ground  This is a very hazardous situation  it can
	destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in
	some situations electrocute you ie some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral

	If this happens contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem

	Note a brief  1 second brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second  In case of doubt get help

Subject What is 3 phase power  Should I use it  Can I get it in my house

	Three phase power has three hot wires 120 degrees out of
	phase with each other  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper

	Youre most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows
	110 volts between any hot and ground and 208 volts between
	any two hots  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	220V110V common neutral circuit which is 240 volts between the
	two hots  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages

	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive or impossible  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount it is MUCH cheaper to
	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it  In some cases it is
	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a
	autogenerator  These are tricky but are a good solution if
	the motor is nonstandard size or too expensive or too big to
	replace  The Taunton Press book The Small Shop has an
	article on how to do this if you must

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that

Subject Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220

	Theoretically it doesnt make any difference  However there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring  All things being equal a 220V motor will lose 4 times
	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor
	will get to speed quicker  And in some circumstances the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than 50 feet long

Subject What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits

	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746
	watts  Given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies
	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 10001200
	watts  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP  Given rational
	efficiency factors 15HP is more like it

	Some equipment manufacturers Sears in particular most router
	manufacturers in general  advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible  They are giving you a stall
	horsepower or similar  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load
	What they dont mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip otherwise the motor will melt  its drawing far
	more current than it can continuously

	When comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower  This
	should be on the motor nameplate  If you cant find that figure
	check the amperage rating which is always present

Subject How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong

	Older homes frequently have twoprong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three  These receptacles have no safety
	ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore

	There are several different approaches to solving this
	    1 If the wiring is done through conduit or BX and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box  NEC mainly  CEC frowns on this practise
	    2 If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and
	       its continuous to the main house ground point you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong
	    3 Run a ground conductor back to the main panel
	    4 Easiest install a GFCI receptacle  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream possibly also two prong
	       outlets  If you do this to protect downstream outlets
	       the grounds must not be connected together  Since it
	       wouldnt be connected to a real ground a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected
	       to other outlets  Be sure though that there arent
	       indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a nonconducting goop
	Like caulking compound  This is not permitted in the NEC

Subject Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets
	Should the test button work

	Were sure about what the NEC and CEC say  Remember though
	that your local codes may vary  As for the TEST button  theres
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the GFCI
	This is a simple passive and reliable test and doesnt require
	a real ground to work  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button it is very probably defective or miswired  Again
	if the test button doesnt work somethings broken and potentially
	dangerous  The problem should be corrected immediately

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected  We do not know why they say this  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing  perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected  On the other hand
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded
	outlet replacement  One of us called Leviton their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only  The technician
	was surprised to see that he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it and promised to investigate

Subject How should I wire my shop

	As with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously  The code specifies
	that you should stay under 80 of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit  For typical home shop use this means one circuit for
	the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac  Use at least 12 gauge wire  many power tools have
	big motors with a big startup surge  If you can use 20 amp
	breakers NEC though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles
	which means youd have to replug all your equipment  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own  and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house  or be on at least two
	separate circuits  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM while youre groping in the dark for the OFF switch

	Do install lots of outlets  Its easier to install them in the
	beginning when you dont have to cut into an existing cable
	Its useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want  But use metal boxes and
	plates and maybe even metalsheathed cable you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong

	Note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members  Ie stapled to studs

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits 220V
	circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits
	Dont overload circuits and dont use extension cords if you
	can help it unless theyre rated for high currents  A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge  Also the insulation wont withstand as much
	heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel
	you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop
	wiring from it  If you have young children you may want to
	equip this panel with a cutoff switch and possibly a lock
	If you want to install individual switches to safe
	particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough
	For example ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the startup surge generated by a table saw  Buy
	horsepowerrated switches instead

	Finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply  And
	even if you know that youd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea

	Note Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring  April 1992 is one place to start

Subject Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications use
	special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber dont use creosoted lumber it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead  The transition from inhouse to underground wire is
	generally via conduit  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets
	fittings etc  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water a more serious style of waterproof box is needed  And
	of course dont forget the GFCIs

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation

	A hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power
	line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed

Subject Aluminum wiring

	During the 1970s aluminum instead of copper wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used  Since that time
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations
	We recommend even if youre allowed to that do not use it for new
	wiring

	But dont panic if your house has aluminum wiring  Aluminum
	wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper
	Aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper
	installation  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	cold creep  When aluminum wiring warms up it expands  When
	it cools down it contracts  Unlike copper when aluminum goes
	through a number of warmcool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time  To make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance
	of the connection goes up  Which causes it to heat up and corrode
	oxidize still more  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot
	melt the insulation or fixture its attached to and possibly even
	cause a fire

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 70s we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring  We suggest that if youre considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things

	    1 Fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it  The device will
	       be stamped with AlCu or COALR  The latter supersedes
	       the former but both are safe   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones

	    2 Wires should be properly connected at least 34 way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction  Connections should be
	       tight  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable  It should be inspected

	    3 pushin terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire
	       Any connections using pushin terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately

	    4 There should be no signs of overheating darkened connections
	       melted insulation or baked fixtures  Any such damage should
	       be repaired
	    
	    5 Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices with an
	       antioxidant grease  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive  not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool

	    6 Any nonrated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper pigtail  See 5 above
	    
	    7 Shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped
	       not nicked wire etc
    
	If when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe  If there are signs of problems in many places
	we suggest you look elsewhere  If the wrong receptacles are used
	you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails  having
	this professionally done can range from 3 to 10 per receptacleswitch
	You can do this yourself too

Subject Im buying a house  What should I do

	Congratulations  But  Its generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas
	Not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any
	minor problems are fixed  If there are signs of problems in many
	places we suggest you look elsewhere

	Heres some hints on what to look for

	Obvious noncode wiring can include

		 Zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls
		 Hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without
		  proper marking
		 Ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of
		  a GFCI
		 Splices hanging in midair other than proper knobandtube
		 Switched neutrals
		 Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one
	time sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations

		 Switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring
		 A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches  except when
		  its really convenient 
		 Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		 Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		 Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		 Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		 Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject What is this weird stuff  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison invented electricity several different
	wiring styles have come and gone  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff  This section describes the old 
	methods and some of their idiosyncrasies

	The oldest wiring system youre likely to encounter is called
	knob and tube KT  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation  The wires are run along side structural
	members eg joists or studs using ceramic standoffs knobs
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping
	with tape  Since the hot and neutral were run separately
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next  In some
	cases KT isnt colourcoded so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires

	Youll see KT in homes built as late as the 40s

	Comments on KT

		 the people installing KT were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good
		 The wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well  Most KT Ive seen for example is in
		  quite good condition
		 No grounding  Grounding is usually difficult to install
		 boxes are small  Receptacle replacement particularly with
		  GFCI can be difficult  No bushing on boxes either
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry
		 Sometimes the neutral isnt balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit
		 Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain KT
		 Connection to existing KT from new circuits can be
		  tricky  Consult your inspector
		 Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than KT systems did
	
	Since KT tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isnt
	necessary to replace it simply because its KT  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading  In many cases its perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing KT alone and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques
	
	After KT they invented multiconductor cable  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two  This stuff was
	used in the 40s and 50s  Again no grounding conductor
	It was installed much like modern wiring  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles  Weve seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems

	This stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible  whenever an opportunity arises replace it
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heatshrink
	tubing

	After this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented
	Its almost a asphalt impregnated cloth  Often a bit sticky
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesnt present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with  It does not need to be
	replaced  it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff 
	thermoplastic insulation wire  Just dont abuse it too much

Subject Where do I buy stuff

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres have better quality materials have wider variety
	including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that
	know what youre talking about  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable
	sales people  Theyll give you much valuable information
