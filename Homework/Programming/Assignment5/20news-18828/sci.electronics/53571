 A quick and dirty way to get higher current carrying capacity
 on PC board traces for one or fewofakind boards is to
 strip some 14 Romex house wiring cable to bare copper form
 the bare copper to follow the trace and solder it down

And if its not quick and dirty you can get bus bars that
are stamped out with leads that insert in the PC board
