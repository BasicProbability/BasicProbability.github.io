   Im doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct
   Input boxes for the keyboards  These are the little boxes that take a
   line level out of the keyboard and transform it into lowZ for the run
   to the mixer  Sadly they cost like 50 or more each and Im going
   to need like 5 or 10 of them  I looked inside one belonging to
   another band and it looks like just a transformer  Does anyone have
   any plans for building them  Perhaps in Andertons Electronic
   Projects for Musicians book which I am having a hell of a time
   tracking down

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two opamps to form the
balanced lowZ output but this solution does not provide any
galvanic isolation between keyboard or whatever plugged and
mixer If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum snap
crackle and pop sounds formed by ground loops can be tolerated
the opamp solution is just what you are looking for It is
cheapsomewhat 10DIbox
Not sure but Craig Anderton did introduce one DIbox project
in Guitar Player mag years ago transformerless

   Thanks a lot

Hope this helps Email if more details wanted
