Im looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good lownoise characteristics  large clean gain and incorportates phantom power 2048 volts dc for a PZM microphone  Im leaning towards a good lowcost  instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone for its good CMRR internal compensation and because i can use a minimal  of parts  

Does anyone out there have any experience suggestions advice etcthat theyd like to pass on Id greatly appreciate it

Without doing anything really tricky the best Ive seen is the
BurrBrown INA103 Their databook shows a good application of this
chip as a phantom power mic pre

Ive had very good results from the SSM2016 from PMI part of Analogue
Devices They have also now introduced the SSM2017 which looks good on
paper but which I havent tried yet
