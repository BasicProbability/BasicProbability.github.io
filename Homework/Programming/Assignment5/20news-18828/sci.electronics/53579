I do NOT know much about Adcom Mobil Audio products but I DO know for a fact 
that ADCOM does NOT make its own High End Home Audio Equptment and that 80 
of it comes directly out of Tiawan 
 
Like most highvolume manufacturers Adcom has most of its PC boards 
assembled offshore in their case mostly in the far east  Final 
assembly and testing are done in East Brunswick 
 

          and of course you older folks on the net will remember 
          way back when Adcom got its RAVE reviews and kudos ca 
          1985  or  so  their  555 amp and preamp WERE not only 
          designed here but built here in  the  USA  then  they 
          went  to  mexico  and then to taiwan right after their 
          sales  skyrocketed   because   of   their   Stereopile 
          review  if you have units that old look for MADE IN 
           stickers on your unit
