Subject Re Telephone on hookoff hok ok circuit 

In article 1ptolqp7ewerpleapanaorgau petertzikzakapanaorgau Peter T writes

Since an onhook line is aprox 4850V and offhook it usually drops below 10V
How about an LED in series with a zener say around 30V
Onhook  LED on
Offhook  LED off
Would this work If anyone triestried it please let me know

Not recommended Your circuit would take too much current when
telephone is onhook Telephone company does not like it
