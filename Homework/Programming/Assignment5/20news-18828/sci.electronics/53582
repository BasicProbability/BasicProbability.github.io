Subject Re Adcom cheap products

 I want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying Adcom seperates
 I have heard from alot of people though that Adcom sounds great but
 that the components are made cheaply and therefore wont last very long
 The time estimates Ive heard are like only 3 or 4 years  Is this true

I own the Adcom 60W power amp  As far as Im concerned theres no
  amp which can touch it at the price range
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing
If you open the amp up there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers  one for each
  channel  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie very good

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast
  or whereever  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant
I cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with
  those quality components inside  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good

My last point I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new

If you build an amplifier decently like the Adcoms they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time  period

Just my thoughts but then  I do own one of Adcoms amps

 The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  
 The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          
 Apprehension creeping like a chootrain up your spine             
 Will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme
