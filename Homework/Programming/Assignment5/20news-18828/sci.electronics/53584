From wtmuhuraneoucomedu Bill Mayhew
Subject Re Illusion

I missed the first articles on this line due to not having a
chance to read the news for a couple of days

The idea is commercialized in at least one product the Private
Eye  Thats a small cubeshaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the users eye

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was HerculesMDA
compatible  The innards are a row 400 LEDs that are swept up
and down by a galvonometerlike movement  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background

I didnt like the device very much  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an outoftheway key
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying  Some people didnt seem to mind the buzz  Properly
used however the image clarity was quite crisp

I dont know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two but it did seem to have promise
