Subject Re Adcom cheap products


Offshore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products 
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van 
Alstine and better than Hafler and Forte but at a much lower cost 

How do you spell tuna helper  

I gather by offshore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
bluefin tunas who are into that squidfi sound  I agree on that one 
My Adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
running the chips class A resistor mod and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better but better sound unfortunately does not appear to be a priority 
with Adcom else the mods would neither have been necessary nor would they 
have improved what was already touted as superlative stateodart lesound 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an sp9II even an sp3a to a GFP555etc or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte amps for a GFA555etc
