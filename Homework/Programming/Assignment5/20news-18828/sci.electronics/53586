Subject Re Adcom cheap products

I have an Adcom GFA555 that I got in 1985  There certainly isnt
anything magic about it  The components used are decent but
nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components

The GFA555 is a nice piece of equipment  Im glad that Adcom had
the guts to not overdo the packaging  It irks me when I see
audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they
are supposed to serve

I dont see any big deal about the geographic region in which
something is assembled  This is especially true for something as
lowtechnology as a GFA555

Id hope that a GFA545 would still work well after several years
Except under conditions of extreme abuse there isnt much there to
go wrong
