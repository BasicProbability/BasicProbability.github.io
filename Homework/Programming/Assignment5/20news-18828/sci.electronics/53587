  It seems reasonable to me that a microwave transmitterreceiver setup  
could 
  do the job For example say you want to map an acre lot itd be  
convenient
  to place MW transmitters around the lots periphery either 2 or 3 and  
then
  carry a handheld recorder and walk to a point on the lot press a button  
and
  the coords of the recorders location is stored as digital data
  
  Whats the chance of this working Any systems like this already exist
  What kind of accuracy could you expect What would something like this
  cost to prototype Is there a better alternative than microwaves
 
 Of course you could develope this system but there is already a system  
called Global
 Positioning Satellites  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on  
earth 
 Many surveyors use this system with a differential receivertransmitter to  
get
 coordinates within centimeters  Basic receivers with resolution of a few  
meters on
 a good day are available from many sources

   Thats the wonderful thing about crayons they can take you to
    more places than a starship can     Guinon
 
 

Thought it means Global Positioning System There are two precision levels one  
for army applications killing has to be very accurate today and one for civil  
ones The civil precision is about 20 to 30m correct me if Im wrong  
though it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings But there is a way with  
an additional reference point eg one fixed GPS system in a house to get the  
same high precision as the military version but it gets pretty complicated  
then If You use a microwave system actually this means some type of radar  
You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
Your original signals So the GPS system seems to be the better and running  
idea for Your applicationthere have been discussions in this newsgroup dont  
know of an address anymore
