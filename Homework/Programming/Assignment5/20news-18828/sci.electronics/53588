Subject Re mysterious TV problem  source

If the set is direct line powered try checking the likely to be
there hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt
supply  Several sets Ive looked at use a 135 volt regulator  The
regulators have a tendency to short out making the safety circuits
shut down the EHT supply section

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower
the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts  If the set
operates nromally then you know youve got a shorted regulator

There are myriad other areas for problems but Ive seen the one
above several times  Also if the set uses one the trippler
module may be shot thats fairly common
