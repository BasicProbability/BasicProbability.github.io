Subject Shrunken monitor window

Does anyone know what causes the evergrowing black border around the
edges of my computer screen  The growth has been gradual so I dont
know how long its taken to get this bad  I have a 19 DEC 
color monitor maybe five years old and the black border is about 11
inches on the left and right sides about 175 inches on the bottom and
negligible at the top of the screen  The only controls are
brightness knob contrast knob deGauss switch and power switch

Is there anything to be done or are the monitors days numbered
