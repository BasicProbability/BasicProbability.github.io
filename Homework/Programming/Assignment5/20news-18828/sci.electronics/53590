Subject Re Dumb Question Function Generator

1  Output offset  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
and adjust the internal output offset contorl  There is virtual
certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
controls zero detent position

2  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded  Many
generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load  Go to a hamfest
flea market and scrounge around for a passthrough 50 ohm
terminator that has a male and female BNC or whatever connector
on it  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out
4v into a 1 meg load but 1 volt into a 50 ohm load  You may
also find that loading the output of the function generator also
reduces the harmonic distortion

Build an attenuator  You dont have to use and I wouldnt want to
use the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
voltage divider to drop the input test voltage  Consider this

10K ohm 
                 
Gen            50 ohm            DUT
loaded         


Think about the ratio of 5010K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope  You can
virtually discount the loading of the DUT  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want

Good luck
