Subject Re What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do

Just to complete that thought the cooling towers cool water that
circulates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbine
exhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transfer
energy from the reactors cooling circuit


     turbine etc  
                                                    
reactor                                              
                                                    C T
        

The reactor has a closed loop circuit to prevent radioactive
contamination of the the turbine feedwater

The cooling tower is a separate circuit to avoide contamination of
the turbine feedwater with atmospheric contamininats etc
Purifying boiler feedwater is important business at both fossil
fired and nuclear generation facilities
