 I really dont know where to post this question so I figured that
 this board would be most appropriate
 I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
 are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
 that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
 actual purpose of those things are I hear that theyre called
 Cooling Towers but what the heck do they cool
 I hope someone can help 
 

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this but never mind
Any machine powered by heat motor steam or gasturbine steamengine  
thermoelementetc work the better the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium steam burning gaz etc You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high A thermal electric power plant coal  
oil or atomic power works just the same way You heat water steam to power  
the turbine and generators Because You dont get the whole energy out of the  
steam efficency is never 100 You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose some  
type of megarefrigerator Others use water of a river ecologically not  
unobjectionable Got it
