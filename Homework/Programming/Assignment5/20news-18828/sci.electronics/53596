Subject Re A question about 120V

SO  Heres my question  It seems to me that Id have the
same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral jumper from the
neutral over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding
outlets Whats wrong with my reasoning here

First go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of Wiring
Simplified by HL Richter  Now if your house is wired with metal
conduit you dont need a seperate ground wire assuming the house
is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water
pipe in your basement  The outlets that have a neutral hooked to
the ground screw seem wrong  Anyone else think so

Back in the 70s I was a service technician for a cash register company
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded

In almost every place we went to do an installation we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral  For 999 of the things you
can plug into one of these they work fine  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare  line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically

With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected  Although not ideal it
should be ok for most applications
