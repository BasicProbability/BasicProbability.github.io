Subject Ungrounded GFCIs was Re A question about 120VAC outlet wiring

In article 1qmisfodpsdlWarrenMENTORGCOM garygwarrenmentorgcom writes

What you CAN do if you want threeprong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper  In fact
depending on where you are putting your new outlets a GFCI may be required

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter

Oddly enough you dont at least according to the wiring FAQ that
is regularly posted on miscconsumershouse

A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents
and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found  No ground connection
is needed for it to function
