Subject Single chip receiver for FSK

My next project is to come up with an IFdetector module for fast  112
to 250 kBsec  packet radio use  No fancy modulation scheme just
wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz

Im a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip but I wonder if there
are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies

My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back
end with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other  Im
particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 107  do any
current chips work up to say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a
normal IF filter can be used

Any suggestions

John
