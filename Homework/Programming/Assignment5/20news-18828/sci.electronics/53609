Sorry if this isnt the correct news group    but   

A colleague of mine is trying to find out when the first public use of 
electronic voice amplification was     ie a PA system

Any reference would be appreciated  Please reply via email

This is vague so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup  The result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder
than a conventional phonograph  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though
