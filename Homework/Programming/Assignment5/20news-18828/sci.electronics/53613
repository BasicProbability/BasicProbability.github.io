Subject Emulator pods

A surplusdealing buddy of mine came up with two emulator pods

	HP64220C for HP 64100 development station 8086 target
	processor DIP head Does not include board that plugs into
	the 64100

	Applied Microsystems 80C186188 pod LCC head

If you have an interest in either let me know They look to
be in excellent condition He doesnt know what to do with them which
may mean that theyll be cheap
