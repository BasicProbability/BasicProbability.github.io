Subject Re help  how to construct homebuilt battery for 3rd grade sci report

 My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries  I was
 wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to
 construct a homebuilt battery  In my grade school days I remember seeing
 the ice cube tray version but I dont remember what to use as a good
 electrolyte or what the easily obtainable metals were  

 Thank you in advance

The simplest one is easy  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc  Then connect a voltmeter to
the contacts and read the voltage
