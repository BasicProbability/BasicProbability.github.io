 Im considering modernizing some old wiring in my home and
 I need a little advice on outlet wiring  Several outlets
 are the old two prong type without the ground  Naturally
 the wire feeding these outlets is 122 WITHOUT the ground
 wire  I noticed at the fusebox that some circuits have the
 122 with ground and that on these circuits the ground
 wire was tied to the same bus as the neutral white wire

They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere
repeat NOwhere else  Well almost  There are strange exceptions for things
like subpanels

Not even in sub panels  The only place the neutral should be connected to the
ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT  In your house the main panel serves as
the service disconnect  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must
maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service
disconnect equipment
