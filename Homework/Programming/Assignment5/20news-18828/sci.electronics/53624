SO  Heres my question  It seems to me that Id have the
same electrical circuit if I hooked a jumper from the neutral
over to the ground screw on new three prong grounding outlets
Whats wrong with my reasoning here  

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this  The ground is
supposed to be a protective ground and though what you suggest
looks good on paper its dangerous to rely on the same wire for
power and protection  Itd never meet code and if you now own
the property and later sell it you may end up with liabilities
you dont want and if you dont now own it well

Theres a wiring FAQ that I think addresses this  I believe
an alternative is use of a GFCI but Im really not sure what
current code allows in this area  The GFCI senses alternate
unwanted current paths and doesnt rely on a specific
protective ground wire at least not beyond the GFCI in the
protected circuit  GFCI breakers are available but expensive
