Subject Heavyduty antenna simulation software


I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for
antenna simulation particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations
though good PC software would also be of interest
Im aware of the numerous mininec mutations and have been using MN for
some time now  Im primarily interested in HF VHF and low UHF  500 MHz
designs mostly wire antennas but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well
as for your basic thin wire assumption
Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself  Ive seen a version
that was mutilated to run sort of under Microsoft Fortran but Im not
sure how many new and improved versions of the code might be out there
somewhere
Id also be interested in nonNEC derivatives  The ones Ive seen have
been aimed at microwave applications but if there is something out there
useful at the lower frequencies Id like to know about it
Thanks
