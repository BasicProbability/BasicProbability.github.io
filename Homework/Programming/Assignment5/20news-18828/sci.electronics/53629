Hi
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a highspeed silicon ADC 100Mhz currently being 
fabricated This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC lowspeed and highspeed
testing using 3 different setups for the test chip
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
the long lead lines have too high an inductance
Getting a custommade package is too expensive so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds
 
	Does anyone out there have experienceknowledge
of this field  I would greatly appreciate help Any ideas
names of companies manufacturing holderssocketspackages
would help 
 
PS The multilayer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit
of overkill

You didnt mention whether or not cost is an issue  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz  THe digital side  TTL
ECL  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain and we use DIPs along
with PLCCs 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFPs to name
a few  I dont see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices  

A good source of information is Motorolas MECL System Design
Handbook The latest ed is dated 288  That is considered
to be one of the bibles in highspeed design

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
youre most likely going to need a socket  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing not to mention any impedance discontinuities  I
dont see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isnt going to make that much difference

If youre trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz have fun
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment
