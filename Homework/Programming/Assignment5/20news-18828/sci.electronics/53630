I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast
  or whereever  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant

Good pointalso I wouldnt be surprised that the components
they use offshore are of inferior quality  As long as it was
properly designed and robust premium components are used it
shouldnt matter where it is assembled

I cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with
  those quality components inside  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good

An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound
The amp you have probably is running ClassA the whole day

Actually Id be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though
the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive 
heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component
regardless of quality  In fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is
because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  Hmmmmm
