During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air 

	Nonsense  First the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders which dont melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant  Second the primary water
that circulates inside the reactor core is never pumped into the
cooling tower its the SECONDARY water cycle that goes 
through the cooling tower  Third liquid uranium would burst
into flame on contact with air

Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

	Cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium  This is a
toxic heavy metal even if it WERENT radioactive  Shouldnt there
be some smileys here  Or frowneys
