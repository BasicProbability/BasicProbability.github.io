Has anybody out there usedtested these new Fluke Scopemeters
How do they compare to a lowend Tectronix oscilloscope Are
there any big drawbacks about these handheld scopes when
compared to the benchtop scopes of the same price range
10002000

Any info on the Fluke Scopemeters would be greatly appreciated

Thanks
