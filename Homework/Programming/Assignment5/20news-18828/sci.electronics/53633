Subject Re TV RECEPTION  HEELLLPPP

At 50 miles a conventional set of TV antennas on a pole one aimed
at each transmitter location should work well

Rabbit ears inside the house are probably not adequate

Gadgets to plug into your house wiring are even worse
At VHF you dont want a big antenna you want a resonant
antenna
