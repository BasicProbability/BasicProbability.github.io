Subject Optoisolator interfacing questions


I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my
cpu board which runs at 56V  The optoisolator is a 4N35
On the led side I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor
to the base of a 2N2222  On the transistor side I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pullup resistor
of 47k

It functions OK but seems VERY slow  I can detect pulses
that occur at about 2kHz but not much faster  Isnt the
risefall time of this device something like 5uS  I should
be able to detect my target of 40kHz but I cant get 16kHz
This is done using wirewrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about 8 inches long but Im not
doing anything highspeed

In the Art of Electronics it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed  Is that what I need to do  How do I calculate the
resistor value
