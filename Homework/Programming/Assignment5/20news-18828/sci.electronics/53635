Subject Pinout needed for TIL311

Ive recently picked up some TIL311 display chips but I cant find
any information on them  It seems they are no longer made by TI and
I dont have an old enough data book  

It appears to have a dotmatrix led display capable of showing one hex
digit  It is in a 14 pin DIP package but pins 6 9 and 11 are not
present

If you have any information on this part pinout power requirments
functions  please send me email

Thank You
