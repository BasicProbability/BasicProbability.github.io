 My friend has a nice Alpine car stereo and it only has 2 channels
 but one of them does not work It does not put out any current or voltage
 at all is that channel therefore blown  I then shut the radio off and
 ran continuity into the two speaker ouputs of the channel and it charged
 and discharged so I know the wires just aint bad 

This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor thats in series
between the onechip singleended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there

 any Ideas 

Open it up and look for the power amp ICs  Theyll be fairly obvious 
Replace the one connected to the dead output 

 also
 how would I locate where the signal of the radiotape unit is BEFORE it
 gets amplified because then couldnt I hook up RCA outputs to that signal
 so then he could just use a little amplifier 

Well one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp
chips  Use a probe with a 10M resistor like a scope probe connected to the
input of a small audio amp wspeaker  If you find linelevel input to both
chips one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily  

If you want to pick off a nearlinelevel signal suitable for feeding to an
outboard amp the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good
enough  This is before the volume control and usually before the tone and
balance controls too  If you take off from the center and ground legs of
the volume pot this will be after the volume control but again probably 
before the other controls  

If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip you should
probably forget the whole thing
