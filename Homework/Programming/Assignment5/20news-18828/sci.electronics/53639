Subject Re History question

Others said
early PA
 I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification
 Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
 pickup  The result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder
 than a conventional phonograph  It tended to wear the disks out
 pretty quickly though

An nowdeceased prof told us willing students about a project he had
worked on during WWII

They needed a megapower PA with very clear audio quality The purpose
was to bellow at refugees from aircraft

Their solution was a giant compressedair source and a horn with
parallel shutters worked by a small audio system I think he said it
worked very well thus the War Dept cancelled the project
