TDWhat
TDis a good choice for a CB 14 or 18 wave
TD  I read the installation instructions on a 14 wave antenna
TDand they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12
TDand channel 32 for a minimum reading  Question is why channel
TD12 and 32

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave probably not the 
best explanation but the rest makes sense A one wave will cancell itself 
out BTW no such beastie  The best is a 12 wave antenna followed by 
14 then 18 etc

As for SWRing in what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on Since the 
wavelength varies with the channel you use then its recommended to SWR 
in using the middle channel of those you are going to use
Anyway in the beginning of CBs all new antennas had to be SWRed in 
nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on so that theres not 
much point in SWRing Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
anyway
