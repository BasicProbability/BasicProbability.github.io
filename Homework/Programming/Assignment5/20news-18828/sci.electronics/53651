Do you know what a bimetallic strip is
Just in case it is two strips of different metals bonded together which 
when heated bend to one side check out the blinker globe in your 
christmas tree lights

So when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon 
heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
the main tube When the tube fires insufficient current runs through the 
starter to keep the heat up and the bimetalic strip straightens out 
OC

BTW I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon so one 
day when the neon in my sisters digital flip the metal squares type 
clock broke flimsy leads I replaced it with one from a starter Well 
powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock
