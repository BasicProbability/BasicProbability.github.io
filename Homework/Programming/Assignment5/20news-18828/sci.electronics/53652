If you are going to use one where it counts egaviation space scuttle 
etc then I suggest you go and buy a Fluke never seen a Beckman however 
for every other use you can buy a cheapie I have a metex which is some 
made up name as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it I 
bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus12500 convert that to US and you see 
that its definetly a cheapie So far it has proved to be accurate taken 
moderate abuse and has many features on it CAP FREQTransistor check 
etc I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name Hope this helps

Cheers
