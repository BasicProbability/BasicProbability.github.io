MCAye theres the rub  if you draw enough current to light an LED th
MCequipment at the phone company will think youve gone off hook
MCIn the onhook state youre not supposed to draw current  

Ok lets have some calculation here Going by Australian standards which I 
presume might be similar to other countries  If not lets have some 
input a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48V line  80mA A standard LED 
drains 20mA So what is the actual loop current required for an off hook 
indication do you know

Up to 60 microamperes     on hook

Over something like 10 mA   off hook

In between  defective line and the phone company comes looking
              for leaky insulation
