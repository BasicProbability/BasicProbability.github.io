An nowdeceased prof told us willing students about a project he had
worked on during WWII

They needed a megapower PA with very clear audio quality The purpose
was to bellow at refugees from aircraft

Their solution was a giant compressedair source and a horn with
parallel shutters worked by a small audio system I think he said it
worked very well thus the War Dept cancelled the project 

Gee I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
use in WWII so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops
landing on a beach for example

Which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid60s  At a communications
conference a Marine Corps communications officer said he didnt care
much for all the spreadspectrum multiaccess expensive communication
systems that people were talking about at the time what he wanted
was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a 495 Japanese
transistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach
