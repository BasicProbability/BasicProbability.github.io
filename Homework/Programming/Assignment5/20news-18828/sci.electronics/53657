This is vague so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup  The result was noisy and distinctly lofi but much louder


NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create
the loudest reported reproduced sound They used an analog electrically
controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat If I 
remember correctly it was called a modulated air blast transducer There
were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB  80 Hz  10 mile
distance communicate directly with fighter pilots  5000 ft etc
