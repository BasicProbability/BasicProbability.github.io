Subject Re subliminal message flashing on TV

 Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
 paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 TV screen at 1200ths of a second  Is that possible  I thought the
 maximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 130th
 of a second  or 160th of a second for an image composed of only odd
 or even scan lines

You are correct the fastest complete image that could be presented on
TV would be one field which is 160 of a second approximately  Of course
the phrase TV screen is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display so perhaps this researcher wasnt using normal TV rates  Might
even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyones guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited
