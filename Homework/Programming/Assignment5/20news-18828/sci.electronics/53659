Subject Re Scope questions

 	If my life depended on it Id say that its a scope that
 	uses longpersistance phosphor to keep the successive
 	taces on the screen for some unit of time  store them
 	Do I get to live

Well let you live but just this once

Theres more to a real storage scope than just a longpersistence
phosphor  Actually the phosphor ISNT usually anything special at all
what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just behind the phosphor
which becomes charged as the electron beam intially writes the trace
With the trace now written to the screen a separate lowlevel flood
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the written areas on the storage screen  There are
some problems with this  the resolution is limited compared to a nonstorage
tube and the stored trace tends to bloom with time 

Of course this is pretty much obsolete technology done in by the current
digital scopes which use rasterscan displays and keep everything in a
framebuffer memory anyways
