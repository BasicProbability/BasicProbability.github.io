If you are going to use one where it counts egaviation space scuttle 
etc then I suggest you go and buy a Fluke never seen a Beckman however 
for every other use you can buy a cheapie

My Beckman died a few days ago thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a
lab table    Probably not indicative of anything but Ive
already filled out the requisition for a Fluke 87 

Oh yeah and sometimes our measurements here do count  Not often but often
enough that I want at least one good meter
