 I really dont know where to post this question so I figured that
 this board would be most appropriate
 I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
 are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
 that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
 actual purpose of those things are I hear that theyre called
 Cooling Towers but what the heck do they cool
  
 Except for their size the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
 are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
 towers designed and built in the 1890s a hundred years ago for
 coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways
  
 Basicly the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
 its air is heated by hot water andor steam circulating thru a network
 of pipes that fill about the lower 13 of the tower To assist cooling
 and the draft water misters are added that spray cold water over the
 hot pipes The cold water evaporates removing the heat faster than
 just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
 rapidly carried away by the draft This produces the clouds frequently
 seen rising out of these towers
  
 That slight pinch maybe 23 of the way up the tower is there because
 it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
 the air draft produced compared to a straight cylinder shape
  
 The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
 system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
 boiler and used again The wider the temperature difference across
 the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
 by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
 back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
 sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage hot
 turbine to final stage cold turbine

Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always
see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water  As I recall the water isnt as hot thermodynamically in many
fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination
