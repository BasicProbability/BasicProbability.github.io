 There are two simple procedures for alterating any odometer

1 Mechanical driven odometer
    Remove the speedo cable from the transmission
    Attach a drill and run at max speed until the speedo turns over
    Continue until the desired mileage is reached

Admittedly an irrelavent questionfor how long should the drill be running

Bijan

A verrrrrry long time like on the order of days  I had the pleasure of
doing that once playing with the speedo cable and with my BD heavy duty at
full speed 600 rpm all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH  Now if you go
a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm you could get 200 MPH out of
it  If you speedo doesnt burn out  Anyways to roll a 100000 Mile
odometer would take 22 days or so  Much easier just to take the speedo
apart

Thought Id share  BTW all this info was obtained legally
