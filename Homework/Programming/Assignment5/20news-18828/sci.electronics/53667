Subject UARTCPUROMRAM subsystem

	This is a followup post to something Ive written previously  Several
people responded with good information but I dont think I communicated 
exactly what I am looking for
	Im working on a custom IO device that will communicate with a host
via RS232  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require
about 64K of RAM preferably FLASH RAM  In looking around I see that lots
of people have engineered UARTCPUROMRAM subsystems that are ready to be
interfaced to your custom IO devices  Its been done so much that it 
would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system  It just needs to use
an 80C186 or 188 CPU and be able to load a program from the host then 
transfer control to that program  Well theres one other thing the ROM
needs to know how to do  It should have routines to send and receive bytes
tofrom the host that utilize the hardware control lines DTRRTSDTSCTS
Everything Ive seen is in the 20000 and up range  Thats too much for
this application  I need something around 10000  The CPU has the UART
builtin so youre only looking at a few chips  Does anyone know a 
company that markets a good board in this range or some public domain 
circuitry I can use  Thanks in advance for the info

Rich
