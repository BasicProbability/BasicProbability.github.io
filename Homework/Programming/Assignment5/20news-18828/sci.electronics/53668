 While Im on the net bugging everyone is there such a thing as a chip
 or chipset to decode Code 39 barcode  I ask for a couple of reasons 
 mainly I want a reasonably compact encoding scheme to write information
 on magstripe cards and Code 39 appears to be about right  If the right
 way to do it is something else and its reasonably easy can someone let
 me know

 I might not get a chance to reply too quickly to this or my earlier post
 but Ill get to them within a couple days I think 

 thanx everyone  BGB  lihanccwfccutexasedu

Hewlett Packard has a series of barcode decoder ICs HBCR1800 HBCR2000
and HBCR2010 and they support 3of9  extended 3of9  interleaved 2of5  
and UPC codes The 2000 and 2010 pieces add codabar and code 128

These chips support HPs barcode wands and slot readers

An 1800  a HEDS3050 wand run about 150 CDN
