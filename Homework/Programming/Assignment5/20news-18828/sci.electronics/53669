 Sells for       69999 JDR MicroDevices current price
                 74595 Products International
 Your price used 42500 obo
I havent gotten an offer at the asking price so obo applies

I also have a broken version of the scope which sold
 JDR 2000 20MHz DualChannel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o 5mVdiv
   o Component Tester resistorscapsdiodescoils
   o TV video sync filter
   o zaxis input intensity modulation

Broken means The CRT produces a nice bright trace but the trace does
not correspond to the input signal My guess is its repairable but more
than a simple calibration problembut I honestly have not tried to
calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it Its asis
I paid 60 for it in its current state I bought it thinking Id repair it
using the good scope for sidebyside comparisonsince Ive sold the
good scope the bad one doesnt do me much good and Id like to recoup
that amount As above Ill accept offers and take the best one

Id prefer a local Bay Area California buyer so a I dont have to
ship it and b she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase
