 I really dont know where to post this question so I figured that
 this board would be most appropriate
 I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
 are ever present at nuclear poer sites They look like cylinders
 that have been pinched in the middle Does anybody know what the
 actual purpose of those things are I hear that theyre called
 Cooling Towers but what the heck do they cool
Great Explaination however you left off one detail why do you always
see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water  As I recall the water isnt as hot thermodynamically in many
fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination

       Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  Theres a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology  So its
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the
way down to ambient  Some plants do cool the condensers with water
rather than air as one Canadian official asked about thermal 
pollution deicing a river said Up here we view heat as a resource  

       Everybody runs closedcycle boilers  The water used is 
purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it so the boiler water is recycled
