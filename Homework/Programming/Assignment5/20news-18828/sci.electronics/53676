Subject Fujitsu 8 HDD

I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed I believe from a digital
XRay machine takes XRay pictures without film  The Fujitsu part number
is B03B4745B002A

I have obtained some data on the device it is 8inch winchestertype
of 168 megabyte capacity though I was told it was over 800 megabytes
However there is very little information on the interface standard used
It appears to use two balancedline connections but what each connection
corresponds to I know not One connection is a 30way IDC the other a
60way IDC

If anyone has any information on this device I would be most grateful
if you could provide it

Thanks


Chris Powell
