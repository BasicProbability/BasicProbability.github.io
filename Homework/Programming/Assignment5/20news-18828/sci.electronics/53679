Can circuits found in electronics magazines with no patent disclaimer
be used legally as subcircuits of a commercial unit 

There are two issues here  copyright and patent

The magazine articles contents are copyrighted and may not be reproduced
translated etc without the copyright holders permission  However this
does not cover the ideas expressed only the form of expression  Copying
their circuit diagram or PCboard pattern is copyright infringement  But
its unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards copyright shouldnt be an issue

Patents are different  The author does not have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent although it would be sensible for
him to do so  In fact its possible that he was infringing on someone
elses patent without realizing it  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement although it might reduce the damages
a court would award

However unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit
almost certainly it is obvious to one skilled in the art and therefore
unpatentable  Routine engineering is not patentable patents in theory
cover only inventions ideas that are genuinely new

Caution  I am not a lawyer  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake
