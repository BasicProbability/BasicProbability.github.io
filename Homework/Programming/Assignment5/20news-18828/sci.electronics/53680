 Patent law says you can build anything
you want to for your own personal noncommercial use

Im not up on the details of US patent law but I think this is incorrect
There is a reasonable use exemption for copyright  There is none for
patents  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow RD work
is exempt but personal use is not  That is its okay to experiment with
a patented idea but not to put it to practical use eg to improve your
stereo even if its only your own private practical use

Of course it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it
