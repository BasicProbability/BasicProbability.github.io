Subject Re What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do

lots of pretty good stuff about how the huge towers near most nuclear
power plants are there to cool the used steam back into near ambient
temperature water deleted

water  As I recall the water isnt as hot thermodynamically in many
fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination

       Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  Theres a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology  So its
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers  

    as a point of info some of the early nuclear power plants in this
country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot and
then had a second stage fossil fuel step to get the water actually
steam VERY HOT

   I remember seeing this at Con Edisons Indian Point 1 power plant
which is about 30 miles north of NYC and built more or less 1958
