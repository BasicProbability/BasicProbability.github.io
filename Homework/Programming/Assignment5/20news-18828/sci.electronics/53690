 MF I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and Ive hit a snag
 MF In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an
 MF op amp amplifier from 1 to 1 controlable via a digital input
 MF The most obvious way Ive come up with is to use analog switches
 MF to adjust the gain of the op amp The only analog switch I have
 MF experience with it the 4066 Unfortunately I want to switch an
 MF AC signal which goes from about 5V to 5V and the 4066 is only
 MF for positive signals

    How about using a 4053 it has a seperate ground for the
    analog outputs  It would get you 3 bits

 MF Another part which caught my eye was the Analog Devices AD630 This
 MF is a balanced demodulator which appears to fill exactly the need I
 MF have The data sheet was somewhat skimpy on application notes Could
 MF someone comment on using this chip for the following application

    Or how about a multiplying DA convertor  This is
    essentiallty what you are makeing
