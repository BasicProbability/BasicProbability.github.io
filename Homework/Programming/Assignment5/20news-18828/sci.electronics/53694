Subject Re What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do

Others said
        Actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
 boilingwater reactor nuclear plants  Theres a gripe in the industry
 that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology  So its
 more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
 as cold as possible  Hence big cooling towers  

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci OH plant Zimmer and
announced they were going to convert it to a coalfired scheme the
turbines were already in place and they were the lowtemp type So the
plan was Install a SECOND set of high temp turbines and feed the
lowtemp ones with the output of the new ones

Never saw anything more on this Did they ever really build it
