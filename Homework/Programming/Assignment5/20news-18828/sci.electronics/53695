 74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed at some cost in
 	power consumption  Effectively obsolete use 74F
 
 74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S for speed comparable to 74 with lower
 	power consumption  Best allround TTL now widest variety of
 	devices
 
 74F	Fast as blazes power not too bad  The clear choice for high
 	speed in TTL  Availability and prices generally good

I hate to disagree w a fellow as smart as Henry but

A few years back I worked on a project using lots of highspeed
stuff  My part was slow  parallel whew The mildmannered designer
working on the fast serial stuff cussed  swore at 74F all the time
It was the Harry Reams of TTL One ultratiny power line glitch one
hickup one eyeblink across the board and bang  the F had
toggledcountedwhatevered  At times he swore it would count even
without any 5 volt supply  You can guess what the F stood for

They would do anything to push S or work around it to avoid using F I
dont think Id consider using F to replace S unless the consequences
were fully understood
