Subject HELP Apple II Expansion Chassis by Mountain Computer


I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain
Computer Inc  It consists of a box with 8 Apple  compatible slots
powersupply brick interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer
to be expanded  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the  motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip  Theres an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16pin DIP jumper like the ones used with  language cards
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I havent a clue as how to hook
this thing up  If anyone has docs andor users disk of any sort for this I
could really use copies of them or at least some help
 
I need to know
 
o How to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis
o How to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card
  and if the small card is used
o The purposes of the various jumperpins on the card it has more
  of those than my CMS SCSI card
 
 
thanks                                          John Daniels
