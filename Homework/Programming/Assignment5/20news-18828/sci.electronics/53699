Subject Re What do Nuclear Sites Cooling Towers do

In C5L5x0KJ7vcdhpcom John Eaton writes

   
During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1 This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the 1 should be measured at the edge of the property
rather than the edge of the cooling tower Eliminating this law will save
power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes

I think you posted your article 15 days too late  April 1st is over
I dont like nuclear powerplants but i think its not fair to tell such
storys about them OK 
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to
   1st Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steamengine
         It has an hightech boiler but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional And if youve already visited any condensation
         powerstation youl have seen the cooling towers too
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics youll find
         a chapter about the CARNOTprocess which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference  And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too  You only can get energy if youve an
         temperature gradient That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox 30 of the 
         energy you or better the uranium brought into the water to
         let it boil If you only have hot steam on the one and cold
         steam on the other side youll loose much more of the energy
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30 of
         energy that carnot will give them
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam 
         The vapor youll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation
         because that steam is radioactive  The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment 
         
   2nd OK the main core IS hot but even in the modernst HighTemperature
         Reactors HTR they only run at 800 deg celsius This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg celsius  But youll have lots of problems with
         the boilers steel Thats because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast
         This is only for BWRs The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to 1200 deg celsius But this is only experimental 

   3rd I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years Today 1 mRem and next year 05 mRem wont be 075 mRem
         at all It accumulates and even in 80 years youll still have
         15 mRem And im not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with 2 heads This is my point of view
