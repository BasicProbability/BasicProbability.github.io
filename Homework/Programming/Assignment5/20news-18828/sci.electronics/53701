Subject  AD board quiry

 
        On an AD board Ive got Im using the AD lines  It measures 
the voltages properly ie with a 7v power supply it regs 7v and with 
5v it regs 5v  Problem is when Ive got the input voltage and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 57v wire in one hand and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by 1v so this is not too feesable 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use
to lower the input voltage  btw Ive got it grounded correctly
