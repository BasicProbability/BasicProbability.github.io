Im looking for an IC that will convert RS232 voltage levels to TTL voltage 
levels  Something relatively inexpensive would be nice too  Anyone have
a suggestion  Thanks


Well it looks as if DigiKey sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what
you want  They are selling it for about 350

Hope this helps
Frank
