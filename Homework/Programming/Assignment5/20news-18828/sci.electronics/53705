	Hello again
 I asked this a year ago but i am still looking
 I am getting sick of having to use a HC373 

Jeff just use the damned 373   Sure there are oddball
latched memory chips but do you really want to use them

Sorry if Im pedantic but design your circuit using
reasonably available parts and move on to more important
problems

Were looking at a series of chips by WSI the PSD3xx series They have
mega address decoding logic on them various ROM sizes upto 1Mbit
various RAM sizes upto 16 K and 19 IO ports which can be chip select
lines IO or the buffered address lines

Cute chip 44 pin PLCC package

Second sourcing may be a problem though
