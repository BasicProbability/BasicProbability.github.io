Subject How does Differential Mode GPS work



I understand that the new GPS boxes now have an option
known as differential ready  Apparently landbased
beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS 
receiver with differential option installed

How does this system work  What frequency is used for
the landbased beacons

Thanks in advance
