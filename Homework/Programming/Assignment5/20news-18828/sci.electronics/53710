Greetings
      
        Situation  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall  I dont
                    know the number of the line  And I dont want
                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it

        Question   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                    use to find out the number to the line
        Thanks for any response
                                                    Al

  


How about calling someone with the Caller ID service and have them call you back
with the number
