 As the subject says  Can I use a 4052 for digital signals  I dont see
 why it couldnt handle digital signals but I could be wrong  Anyone have
 any advice  Thanks

The switches have a nonnegligable on resistance up to 1k ohm when
powered by 5 volts and a maximum current and a Maximum Static
Voltage Across Switch  Not a good bet for TTL  Should work for
CMOS but slow things down a bit  There are 74HC versions that
have better specs but lower max voltage
