  And the measure of current Amp is actually named after both the AMP company
  and the Amphenol company  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
  simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
  were affected by the amount of current running through the wires
 
 Sorry  The unit for current is the AMPERE which is the name of a frenchman
 named AMPERE who studied electrical current  The term AMP is just an abbreviation
 of it  The company AMP came after the AMPERE unit was already in use
   
  The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus
  our use of the Ohms
 
 I dont know about this one but it doesnt sound right
Are you two joking
Is the entire Internet flaming you two
Ahh now I remember that Ohmite company was the first introducing the pink
colored resistor only for electronics working females
