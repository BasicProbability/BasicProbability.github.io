 I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the fareast
   or whereever  But if you look in the amp and see what components
   they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the
   amplifiers sound so brilliant

 Good pointalso I wouldnt be surprised that the components
 they use offshore are of inferior quality  As long as it was
 properly designed and robust premium components are used it
 shouldnt matter where it is assembled

Definately I agree wholeheartedly  If they can build the amp where
  the labour is not so expensive they can afford to put decent
  components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
  amplifier  as Adcom has done

 I cannot see why people say the amplifier wont last  not with
   those quality components inside  Sure the amp runs very fairly
   hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good

 An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound
 The amp you have probably is running ClassA the whole day

 Actually Id be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though
 the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive 
 heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component
 regardless of quality  In fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is
 because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
 to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  Hmmmmm

Sure I didnt mean to imply that because of the heat generated the
  amp sounds good  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm  not hot to
  the touch  but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely
I dont like it when an amp runs deadcold  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing 
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy  theyre massive things with heating vents both below
  and above  More than enough to carry away excessive heat

My opinions once again

 The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  
 The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          
 Apprehension creeping like a chootrain up your spine             
 Will the tightrope reach the end will the final couplet rhyme
