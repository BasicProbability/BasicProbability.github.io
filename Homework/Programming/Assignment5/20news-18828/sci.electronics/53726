Im looking for an IC that will convert RS232 voltage levels to TTL voltage 
levels  Something relatively inexpensive would be nice too  Anyone have
a suggestion  Thanks
 
 Well it looks as if DigiKey sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what
 you want  They are selling it for about 350
 
DigiKey also sells Quad Line Receivers parts DS1489AN 68cents and DS1489N
48cents  A Quad Line Driver part DS1488 48cents is also sold  I guess
if you dont wont to supply 12V the chips with the pumpup circuitry might
be worth the extra cost  But 1488s and 1489s are available at your friendly
neighborhood RS parts MC1488 2762520 for 129 and MC1489 2762521 for
129
