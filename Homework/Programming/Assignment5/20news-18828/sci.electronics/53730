 If you are going to use one where it counts egaviation space scuttle 
 etc then I suggest you go and buy a Fluke never seen a Beckman however 
 for every other use you can buy a cheapie
 
 My Beckman died a few days ago thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a
 lab table    Probably not indicative of anything but Ive
 already filled out the requisition for a Fluke 87 
 
 Oh yeah and sometimes our measurements here do count  Not often but often
 enough that I want at least one good meter

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 ruggedized versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work   After a while we
got round to filling all the currentinput jacks with silicone 
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 12 digit 05  autoranging 400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not Its very hard on meters
and electricians when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus 
  But thats not why we stopped buying Beckmans  after a while a 
lot of them got funny in the LCD display  A black stain would
spread from one edge or else theyd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate    Now we buy Flukes the
lowend 20 series mostly  and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone 
  What the world needs is a meter that wont let you change ranges or
turn it onoff with a lead stuck in the amps jack  a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans anyway
   Not that Ive ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit no not menot more than a dozen times anyway
