For your information

I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the CItoh
8510 driver in Windows 31  The cable I am using is a straightthru
cable connected to a Null Modem Adapter I got at Radio Shack catalog
261496a for 495  It seems to work fine with both DOS and Windows
I used the following command in DOS

	CDOSmode COM19600n81p

and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup

the Null Modem connections are as follows

	1	to	1
	2	to	3
	3	to	2
	4	to	5
	5	to	4
	68	to	20
	20	to	68
	7	to	7

I printed from several applications and all seems OK
