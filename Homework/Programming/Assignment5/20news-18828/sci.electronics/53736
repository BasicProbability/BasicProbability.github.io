Subject Re How starters work really

So when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon 

Imprecise This description

 1 ignores the role of the ballast
 2 misrepresents the heating effects in the starter

The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts

Ive been thinking of sending into Mad magazine an idea for a 
parody of those books entitled How Things Work that
engineers buy their sons which explain how engines elevators
flourescent lights etc work

The parody would be How Things Really Work  Under Canned
Food on the left page youd see the description from 
How Things Work gleaming stainless steel equipment
pasteurizing the food to precisely the right temperature
then sealing the can in an oxygenfree environment etc

On the right page youd see How Things Really Work
braindead workers sending disgusting food to the
gleaming equipment  rotting vegetables parts of
animals people dont eat barrels of sugar and chemicals

Under Elevators youd see on the left computer geniuses
working out algorithms so that X number of people
waiting for Y elevators will get to Z floors in the shortest
time  On the right youd see giggling elevator controllers
behind a oneway mirror in the lobby choosing which people
appear to be in the biggest hurry and making them wait longest
 
Why my thoughts are my own when they are in but when they are out
they are anothers  Susannah Martin hanged for witchcraft 1692
