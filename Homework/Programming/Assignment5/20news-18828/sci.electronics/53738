Greetings
      
        Situation  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall  I dont
                    know the number of the line  And I dont want
                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it

        Question   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                    use to find out the number to the line


Call a friend long distance collect  Ask to speak with yourself  When
the operator asks for you you wont be there so ask the operator to leave
your number  Shell read it out in the clear
