Subject Mysterious MOSFET

I have a MOSFET pulled out of a Trygon power supply for which I have no 
manual  Its a Motorola part with a 1972 date code and the number

		2854

which the Motorola folks assure me is a house number which they cant
help me with  Any suggestions from folks out there  I cant put it on
a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent since its completely shot
