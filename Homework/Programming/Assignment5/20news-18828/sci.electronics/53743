Subject Dayton Hamfest


Some weeks ago someone posted an article telling when and where
a hamfest and computerfest was going to be help in Dayton OH
Unfortunately I lost the article and I was wondering if someone
could repost it

I believe it was being held the 2324and 25 of this month at
the Dayton convention center but Im not sure

Any help and more details would be greatly appreciated
