 VA CT Wash DC  and I think BC Canada where Ive heard they actually
 use Radar detector detectors

 Nope not in British Columbia  Detectors are legal here in BC Ive even
 got one

 In Alberta and Ontario theyre illegal and detection devices are sometimes
 used  Ive heard the police in Ontario prefer a much more direct method of
 detection  Just trigger the radar gun watch for people slamming on the
 brakes and search the car

Detectors are legal in Alberta the old law was overturned a long time ago
