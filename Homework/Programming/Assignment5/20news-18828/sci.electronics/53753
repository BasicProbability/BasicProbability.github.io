Does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitterreceiver
microphone systems that Radio Shack sells operate at  Ive tried
everything short of opening one up not actually owning one makes
this difficult and just looking  Any help would be greatly
appreciated  These systems are designed for wireless PA systems etc
 
 
					Thanks
