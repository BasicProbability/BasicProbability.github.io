 My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries  I was
 wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to
 construct a homebuilt battery  In my grade school days I remember seeing
 the ice cube tray version but I dont remember what to use as a good
 electrolyte or what the easily obtainable metals were  
 
 Thank you in advance
 
I remember watching a whole Mr Wizzard program on this subject when
I was a kid  The battery constructed on the program which made the 
biggest impression on me and generated the most power was made using
a galvanized bucket for the zinc and a copper toilet tank float  The
electrolyte was sauerkraut
