Subject Need pinouts for a G8870 dtmf decoder chip


I bought this chip from Suncoast Technology and tried to build their
dtmf decoder circuit  But its not working

If anyone has the pinouts and possibly the voltage specs Id sure
appreciated it  If someone could fax email or snail mail a copy
of the spec sheet for this chip that would be even better 

Please email me if you can help  

Thanks in advance
