 I dont know why my FPU has an XC my original 33MHz FPU
was label MC6888233 but it seems to work fine on my system
PS Or does it mean eXperimental Chip instead of Motorola Chip 

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC that means it works
exactly the way the datasheetbook specifies  If it says XC that means
there is at least one known bug  Often these bugs are small and obscure
you might never run into them in practice

At least Motorola admits it unlike certain other companies
