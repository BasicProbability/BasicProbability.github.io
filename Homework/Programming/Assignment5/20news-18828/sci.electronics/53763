I have a MOSFET pulled out of a Trygon power supply for which I have no 
manual  Its a Motorola part with a 1972 date code and the number

               2854

which the Motorola folks assure me is a house number which they cant
help me with  Any suggestions from folks out there  I cant put it on
a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent since its completely shot

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage its probably not a very good one by 
todays standards  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings eg 60VDC  6A you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs  Early MOSFETS had a gatesource voltage rating 
of approximately  20 VDCmax and they would usually turn completely ON 
at 10VDC  Otherwise MOSFETS are not really mysterious  theyre more or 
less voltage controlled current sources  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an openloop voltage controlled current source you may have to 
experiment with various gainaltering techniques
