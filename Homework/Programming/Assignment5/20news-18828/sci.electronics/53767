Subject Re electronic odometers was Used BMW Qu


    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator

    I wouldnt expect to be able to do this  Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in antifraud logic but just because an automobile is a noisy hostile
environment for electronics and I would expect the software to be conservative

   If I were to design a microprocessorbased odometerspeedometer program
it would have the following features  just off the top of my head 

          Debouncingdeglitching   Is this a real pulse or just a glitch 
          Smoothing  The rateofchange of speed cannot be too high
                                This is a car not an electron
           Top speed limit  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
middle of the card  Good luck getting at the counter 

    I wouldnt expect a high input frequency to damage the meter  remember its
probably damped so it cant move too fast and is probably protected  After all
a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics  there used to be an
app note in the National Semiconductor Linear Databook that went into this
in good detail
