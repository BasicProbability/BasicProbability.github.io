I am in the midst of designing a project which requires two motors and an LED
illuminator driven with Pulsewidth modulation  Im using the 8751 and
I understand that the FB version has a programmable counter array that can
essentially be set and forgotten to do the PWM  The problems is that variant
is difficult to come by  I need two or three of the D prefix ceramic window
version for development and then lots of the P prefix plastic OTP for later
production  Ive tried Avnet Arrow and Pioneer  They might have them but
Im looking for samples at this point and theyre not too willing to provide
them  I would buy them but these vendors have 10000 minimums

Any help is appreciated
