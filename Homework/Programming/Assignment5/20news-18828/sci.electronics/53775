  My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries  I  
was
  wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how  
to
  construct a homebuilt battery  In my grade school days I remember

I havent been following this so Im sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this but you could grab a lemon I think potatoes work too but Im not  
sure a strip of copper and a strip of zinc I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop maybe  Stick the strips in  
the lemon so they dont touch and youll get a measurable voltage not  
a lot but hey its a lemon     As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current because of the mondo internal resistance but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something
