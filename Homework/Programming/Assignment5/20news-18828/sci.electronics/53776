Subject Re Need pinouts for a G8870 dtmf decoder chip

In article montC5qs9A3wBnetcomcom montnetcomcom Mont Pierce writes

I bought this chip from Suncoast Technology and tried to build their
dtmf decoder circuit  But its not working

If anyone has the pinouts and possibly the voltage specs Id sure
appreciated it  

I presume it is the M8870 from Teltone Corporation

Pin	Description

1	 input
2	 input
3	GS gain select through use of feed back resistor
4	Vref reference voltage OUTPUT about Vdd2
5	connect to Vss
6	connect to Vss
7	osc1 clock input
8	osc2 clock output connect crystal across pins 7 and 8
9	Vss
10	OE output enable logic high allows data output
11	Q1 data output
12	Q2 data output
13	Q3 data output
14	Q4 data output
15	StD Delayed Steering Output any other company would call this data valid
16	ESt Early Steering output sort of like Im starting to hear a tone
17	StGT Steering inputguard time output
18	Vdd

Power Supply	 475V min 525V max
Current		 30mA Typ 70mA max

BUT

You really should have bought the Motorola part from me  
I still have them in stock

If someone could fax email or snail mail a copy
of the spec sheet for this chip that would be even better 

Please email me if you can help  

Thanks in advance
