Subject WANTED  TCM3105 chips small quantities


Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips as used in the
Baycom and my PMP modems  Ideally something that is geared toward 
hobbyists  small quantity mail order etc

For years weve been buying them from a distributor Marshall by the
hundreds for PMP kits  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service  And all of the distributors Ive
checked have some crazy minimum order 100 or so

Id like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits
Any suggestions
