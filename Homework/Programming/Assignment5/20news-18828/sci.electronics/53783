Subject Building a UV flashlight

Yes I know it sounds crazy Call it an urge Call it what you want
Just dont ask why 

Anyway Id like to build a UV flashlight cheaply flashlight means
it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if
necessary

My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they
need a lot of power etc etc

Im not too concerned with whether its longwave or shortwave
but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs Ill take both

One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearUV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light Does anyone
know what he was referring to

Thanks much
