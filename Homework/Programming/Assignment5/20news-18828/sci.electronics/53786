Subject references

Ive got the same problem I cant dig up any info on the jumper settings
on the hd 35 drives

Can anyone recommend a reference books on the subject rather than a
quick fix type answer  I was going to start hooking up things and
logging the results but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters
me

Thanks Kirk Cowen
