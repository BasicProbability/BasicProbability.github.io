Subject RE Exploding TV

Just a thoughtMaybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it
IS an Emerson  Ive got an Emerson VCR which is 6 in the series  Returned
it six times for various and never the same problems  Got tired of taking it 
back and fixed it myself  The HiFi window was a bit off  Something like
the HiFi audio finetuning  When I was a WalMart associate in 8889
we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY  Hows that for
reliability  Face itEmerson can make audio stuff albeit not of premium
quality but they CANT make anything as complex as video equipment with 
reliability IMHO  Please no flames  Just had to share my Emerson disaster
in the light of this exploding tv
