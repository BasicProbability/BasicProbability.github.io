Subject Info NEC70001AB Amp IC  20W AMP secs  possible PSPICE models

Hi

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt I find myself needing to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp So 
Ill throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the net

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits No
Not PIE Just how it relates to one of the following

	Ai Current Gain
	Av Voltage Gain
	Ap Power Gain
	or whatever

I already have a wonderful cheap IE 20 schematic for a 20W amp but
I would like to Crossimprove the circuit The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers They look like 11 pin 
SIP packages with a heatsink This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be nonexistant now Anyway I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digikey Cat and found it  not listed 8 The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU Anyone got any Ideas 

	I thought hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models Yea great It worked But I guess the 741 wasnt made for High
power amps As a result I got a Voltage gain of 15mVV Worse than
I started with 8 Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
Email Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me 

Im open to SuggestionsIdeasCommentsHelp
Please Email since I have little time to search the News 
And Ill post if theres and interest
