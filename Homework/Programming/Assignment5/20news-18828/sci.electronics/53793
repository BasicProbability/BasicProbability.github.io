Subject Re Radar detector DETECTORS

In article 1993Apr2002292211861julianuwoca wlsmithvalveheartrriuwoca Wayne Smith writes
No restriction was placed
on receiving RADAR or curiously cordless phones  Enforcement
of the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934

Isint there some kind of rule regulation law whatever in some
juristictions that prohibit the use of police band recievers
in vehicles  And that radar transmissions are included in the police band 
so they get covered by the same regulation

Those rulesregulationslaws would be subject to the same attack  that
they are attempting to preempt federal authority to regulate or not
radio communications  Of course as the original poster noted court
challenges of this kind can get expensive
