Subject Help wanted

Could someone please tell me if a 14 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4
demultiplexer I know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit
but how do I link 5 of these to make a 116 multiplexer Sorry if this
seems like a lame question but Im only a newbie to electronics and I
have to do this circuit Please make any mail as droolproof as possible

				 Thanx
