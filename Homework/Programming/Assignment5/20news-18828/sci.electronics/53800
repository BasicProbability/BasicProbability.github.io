Subject Re Dmm Advice Needed


   What the world needs is a meter that wont let you change ranges or
 turn it onoff with a lead stuck in the amps jack  a little bit of
 clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
 safer for electricans anyway
    Not that Ive ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
 circuit no not menot more than a dozen times anyway

The Fluke 87 beeps at you if you try to take it out of a current measuring
range while there is still a lead plugged in to the current sense socket

 this should solve your problem  unless you are in a noisy environment
