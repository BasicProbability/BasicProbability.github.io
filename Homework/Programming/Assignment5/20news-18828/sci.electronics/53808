Subject Re Need to find out number to a phone line

Greetings
      
        Situation  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall  I dont
                    know the number of the line  And I dont want
                    to call up the operator to place a trace on it

        Question   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                    use to find out the number to the line
        Thanks for any response
                                                    Al

  

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack  If not
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box If you do get a dial tone then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to someplace or somebody Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebodys unlisted number  Fess up
