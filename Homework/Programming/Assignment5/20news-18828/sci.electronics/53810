Subject Homemade projector automation


Hi all

Im an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus  Id
like to expand our show automation a bit namely add the capability to
use cue tapes to bring the houselights up  Our current automation
consoles date from the early 60s and dont provide this function

We already have the combo failsafecontact rollers to read the cuetapes
and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fadeup control
circuit 120 VAC is momentarily closed for at least 05 second

Ive tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay activated when the
cue tape completes the circuit  Low tech and simple but theres one
problem  In order to get the 12 second pulse there needs to be
a shload of cuetape on the film  35mm runs at 90 feet per minute
so to get a 12 second pulse there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid
cuetape

Ideally I would like to use a single crosscue to accomplish this function
A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film
This would give a pulse of approximately 1100 of a second
What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay
for around 12 second  The ability to adjust how long the relay
is activated would be nice  I figure this would require an RC circuit
of some sort  Im sure some of you already have the solution figured
out in your heads  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated


Thanks
