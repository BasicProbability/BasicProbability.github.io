I was looking at the amps diagram for Sony 10902090 receivers and I
was amazed to find a difference between the US and Canadian model
on the capacitors that hangs off the output to the speakers

                          to speaker identical both models

        0022                   Canadian model only
     US model            0047 
     and worldwide        
     model only                  Candian model only

                        gound

The board itself is also identical with room for all three caps The
USCan versions is clearly indicated in both places

How does that make sense 00472 is 00235 essentially 0022 for caps
there are just standard caps no special Wtypeprecision 

Please explain this

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage Sometimes two elcos in antiseries
you know positive sides facing eachother are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well

So there probably is no designphilosophical reason but a productioncost
one
