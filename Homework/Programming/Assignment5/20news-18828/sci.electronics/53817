Does anyone know the details of the interface 5 wire din for the
IR remote sensor  2 wire IR repeater for the ADCOM GTP500II
preamp  The ADCOM part numbers are the XR500II SPM500II and 
IRA500II

A cursory physical examination of the preamp connector indicates
that the connector 5 pin din may provide Viewed from connector front

      
   5     1     pin  v  mA
    4   2      pin  v  mA
      3        pin 3 Signal Ground
               pin  Demodulated signal Vpp  polarity  mA drive
               pin  Signal to drive repeater LED drives through 150ohm
                       resistor Vpp

I assume that the repeater connectors miniplugs drive the IR repeater
LEDs directly  True

Can anyone fill in the s  Thanks
