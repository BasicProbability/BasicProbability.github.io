   And the measure of current Amp is actually named after both the AMP company
   and the Amphenol company  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
   simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
   were affected by the amount of current running through the wires
  
  Sorry  The unit for current is the AMPERE which is the name of a frenchman
  named AMPERE who studied electrical current  The term AMP is just an abbreviation
  of it  The company AMP came after the AMPERE unit was already in use
    
   The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus
   our use of the Ohms
  
  I dont know about this one but it doesnt sound right
 Are you two joking
 Is the entire Internet flaming you two
 Ahh now I remember that Ohmite company was the first introducing the pink
 colored resistor only for electronics working females
