Subject Re Building a UV flashlight

You can get a little UV by putting a heavy UV filter deep purple in
front of an ordinary flashlight bulb the brightest you can get
My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964

Good UV blacklight bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs  Id proceed by
getting a cheap batterypowered fluorescent light then going to an
electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it
