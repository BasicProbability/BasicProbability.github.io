Subject Re Telephone Controlled Power Bar Needed


I had a similar idea for a faxanswering machine switch
to put both machines on one line  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company  This is 3month here
You get a second unpublished phone number  When
someone calls this number your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings  Youd give out the new  as your fax 
A device would measure the length of rings  When it
detects a short ring it turns off your answering machine
Five rings later your fax picks up the call

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the 80
switches now available

But thats not what I did  Im giving out the new
 to my friends and customers  This should leave the
old  for telemarketers etc  I wont pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings
 
Why my thoughts are my own when they are in but when they are out
they are anothers  Susannah Martin hanged for witchcraft 1692
