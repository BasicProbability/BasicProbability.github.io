Subject Re Dmm Advice Needed

Ive had my Fluke 8060A here at work for just over 10 years now
It is a wonderful meter  Several colleagues here have some of the
newer Fluke meters though I still would just as soon hang on to my
8060  The 8060 a is the 1980s digial analog to the Simpson 260
analog DMM of the 19501960s  There wasis  an 8060B that had
extended frequency response

Ive got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep
in my toolbox at home  Ive had that for six or seven years now
and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees it is more than
adequate for daytoday hobby use  I think Soar OEMs their stuff
for a number of vendors  Some of JDR Microdevices stuff looks
rather similar to Soars
