Subject Re help How to reduce the RPMs of a Boxer fan 

Yes you increase the RPM slip of a boxer type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fans power supply  The air flow of
small 35 inch fans can be reduced by about 50 by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application

For DC powered applications try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 45 VDC  It is
exceptionally quiet but at admittedly low flow  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack
