Yes

Take Interstate I70 to the route 48 exit  Go south on 48 about
212 miles  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena which is about 1 mile west and on the north
side of the Road  Parking at the arena is limited  Lodging is
probably entirely bookedup within a 40 mile radius  Good luck

                                
                48               I75
                                
I70
                                
                                
          X                     
mall                  
   S Springs   

It is possible to park at the mall to the west  There are shuttle
busses running between the arena and the mall

If possible get a Montgomery County OH map from your local AAA
office  It should be free if you are an AAA member

If you dont already have definite plans now is not a particularly
good time to start to think about going to the hamvention
