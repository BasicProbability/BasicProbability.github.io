Subject Laser vs Bubblejet

Well Im not too sure if this would be the right place to post this but
anyway here goes  I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet
printers offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser
printers only offer 300x300  However the laser printers still seems to be
significantly pricier than the bubblejets how is this  Or am I missing
something about the resolution thing
