 PS any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AMFM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
 ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot
 I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
 circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations the MiniCircuits
part you mention is a doublybalanced diode mixer but active ones
BJT FET seem more popular in consumer receivers  You might
call MCL they have a nice catalog

The universal answer for widecoverage theorypractice RF design
is the ARRL Handbook published by the American Radio Relay
League the radio amateur organization  Any technical bookstore
can order you one  The book is superb with lots of accessible
theory construction projects and generally interesting stuff

You might also check out Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur
I think by Hayward and someone  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers
