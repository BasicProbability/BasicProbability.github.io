Subject PADS Question  How do I go from a schematic  PCB

After I have produced a schematic with PADSLOGIC how do I import it into 
PADSPCB to create a PCB pattern  The only way Ive gotten it to work is
to output a FutureNet netlist and then import this into PADSPCB  Is there
another way of doing this  I didnt see any information in the instructions
provided but I might have missed something  Any suggestions would be 
greatly appreciated  Thanks
