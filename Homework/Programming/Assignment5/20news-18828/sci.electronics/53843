Well Im not too sure if this would be the right place to post this but
anyway here goes  I was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet
printers offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser
printers only offer 300x300  However the laser printers still seems to be
significantly pricier than the bubblejets how is this  Or am I missing
something about the resolution thing

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit whereas LaserJets given halfway decent
toner like HPs Microfine stuff dont  Both produce very good output
but you dont have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior  

On the other hand LaserJets which havent been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output much
worse than a bubblejet 

One other thing there are bubblejets and then there are BubbleJets
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
such as HPs dinky little BubbleJet whereas most produce really good
looking output such as HPs DeskJets  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets

PS  If youre in the market for a portable bublejet printer I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet although Ive heard the portable
Canons are good too I needed PCL support myself  With the DeskJet
Portable you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot
