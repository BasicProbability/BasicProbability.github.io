I would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters more is better in
daylight  The IR source could be emitting a signature Im leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50 duty cycle

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc to give
information to a pantilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LEDs
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10 and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50 required

Has anyone done something like this

A method which will directly almost provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks eg the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB Sweden and the
WATSMART System   These use lateral photoeffect detectors Lindholm and
Oberg 1974 Woltring and Marsolais 1980 to determine the position of a
spot of light projected using a camera lens over its surface  In escence
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal and a single anode the back of
the crystal  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detectors face  Lets try some ASCII
graphics in 2D so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina
tion the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light then the way of
tuning to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2D lateral photoeffect detectors and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics  The readymade
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pantilt system until you reach zero difference
