TDWhat
TDis a good choice for a CB 14 or 18 wave
TD  I read the installation instructions on a 14 wave antenna
TDand they suggested that I use an SWR to tune it at channel 12
TDand channel 32 for a minimum reading  Question is why channel
TD12 and 32

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave probably not the 
best explanation but the rest makes sense A one wave will cancell itself 
out BTW no such beastie
	Yes there is  Not common for CB  The pattern is different sort of
	a cloverleaf with four main lobes

 The best is a 12 wave antenna followed by 14 then 18 etc
	Use of anything under 14 wave for transmitting is very uncommon  The
	usual rubber duck uses a coil to fool itself into looking like a
	quarter wave
	I reccomend the ARRL Antenna Handbook or a good basic book
