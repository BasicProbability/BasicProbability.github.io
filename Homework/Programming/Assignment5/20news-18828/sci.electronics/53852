 My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they
 need a lot of power etc etc


he ones I have seen are all fluorescent tubes Maybe you could find a
small tube to go in one of those handheld fluoro lanterns

 One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearUV
 light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light Does anyone
 know what he was referring to

Blue lights Ultraviolet by definition goes from the blue end of the
spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum Xrays cosmic rays etc

possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility which people
with false eyelenses can see easily since its your lenses that soak up
most of the UV however since most people use UV to get other things
to glow and the nearblue is less energetic it would probably not
work as well if it worked at all lecture on basic atomic physics
fits in here about electron transitions quantum leaps and stuff
