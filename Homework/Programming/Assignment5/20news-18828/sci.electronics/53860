Subject  MOSFET help

 
        Since Im not all too keen on this area of hooking them up Im 
asking for help  I know better than to hook a 12v 1a stepper line to 
one unless it can take it however what about if Ive got a 2460v 
stepper  What sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved a 
small schematic would probably be helpfull  
        Also Ive looked into the TIPC2701N by TI and I was wondering 
if I should use the same suggested by you replying to this message 
current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as 
that illustrated in the schematic which you the replyer would hopefully 
help me with
 
                                 hmm different request 
 
                Thanks
