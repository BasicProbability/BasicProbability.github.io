      Hello 
 
    Let me introduce a problem
 
    When I measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter using 
 AC mode my output is an rms value a peak value over 2 squared  Right  
    When I measure a square wave in the same mode AC my output is equal 
 to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave
    I assumed that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
 input value and divides it over the wave period  Right
    Now I used it to measure the same  square wave as above but distorted 
 by highfrequency harmonics Ideally output should be the same but
 The output value was only about 10 of the previous one 
    Why What is the nature of this output value What does the voltmeter 
 actually measure And what does it show  


Re RMS readings

Unless the DVM says its measuring RMS its probably Average voltage
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC  If it says its RMS
and but measures squaretriangleetc  incorrectly its measuring
average and multipling by a correction thats only true for sine waves
ie  Vave0707063  Vrms  If you want correct RMS for most
any waveform you need a TrueRMS DVMDMM which literally does the
RootMeanSquare calculation in either analog or digital circuitry

 
    Related question less important to me
    What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
 analog ones 

The last significant advantage of analog IMO  was  being able to
see the signal if it was changing over time eg  checking
electrolytic capacitors

Anymore most DMM have bargraphs etc that duplicate this

 
    Thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at
 avm1993zeustamuedu or open a discussion here I would appreciate either 
 way
