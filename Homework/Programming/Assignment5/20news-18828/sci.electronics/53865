I am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and Ive hit a snag
In my application I want to be able to change the gain of an
op amp amplifier from 1 to 1 controlable via a digital input
The most obvious way Ive come up with is to use analog switches
to adjust the gain of the op amp The only analog switch I have
experience with it the 4066 Unfortunately I want to switch an
AC signal which goes from about 5V to 5V and the 4066 is only
for positive signals

 I have a carrier signal which varies between 0V and 5V I want
to demodulate an input signal by feeding the input signal thru a
amp with a gain of 1 when the carrier is at 5V and thru a amp
with a gain of 1 when the carrier is 0V The output is then
low pass filtered I believe this is called lock in detection as well
as synchronous demodulation

Look at the 4053  This is a triple 2to1 transmissiongate analog
multiplexer with positive and negative power supplies can be run
from a singleended supply as well  With dual supplies the logic
inputs still range from ground 0 Volts to VDD

This is a neat well I think so design for a switchablepolarity
amplifier

                 
                                   
                         
INPUT            
                       opamp  OUTPUT
              
                     
                 
CONTROL	X analog switch
                 
                 
                
                GND

All resistors are equalvalue  When the analog switch is closed
the amp is invertinggainofone  With the switch open it is
noninvertinggainofone  You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance this would show
up as carrier feedthrough

For high frequencies the slewrate of the opamp might cause problems
especially if it isnt symmetrical and it usually isnt

       I used to think I was indecisive but now Im not so sure
