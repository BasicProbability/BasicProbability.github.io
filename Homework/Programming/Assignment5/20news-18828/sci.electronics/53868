My car unfortunately has so much computer junk under the hood that its
astonishingly sensitive to RFI  

Hmmmmm this has possibilities
If the police are in pursuit of a vehicle maybe they can bombard it with
high energy RFI  

Right So all the cops will be buying antique muscle cars for chase cars
otherwise the police cars will die too


                     To get the attention of a large animal be it an
