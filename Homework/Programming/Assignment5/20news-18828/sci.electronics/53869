 Yes I know it sounds crazy Call it an urge Call it what you want
 Just dont ask why 

 Anyway Id like to build a UV flashlight cheaply flashlight means
 it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if
 necessary

 My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they
 need a lot of power etc etc

 Im not too concerned with whether its longwave or shortwave
 but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs Ill take both

	Check out a medical supply catalog the thing you are looking for
is called a woods lamp so you can check for woods sign certain skin
conditions flourecse sp under UV light  They come in disposable
penlight like types and larger ac powered types  It is also used in eye
examinations a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye
then UV is shined on it shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly
that would otherwise be very difficult to detect  for the completest the
dye is called flouescien and in normal light appears orangish and leaves
a mild burning sensation to the eye for 1015 minutes until the tears
flush it all out  

Have fun
