Does anyone know the details of the interface 5 wire din for the
IR remote sensor  2 wire IR repeater for the ADCOM GTP500II
preamp  The ADCOM part numbers are the XR500II SPM500II and 
IRA500II

A cursory physical examination of the preamp connector indicates
that the connector 5 pin din may provide Viewed from connector front

      
   5     1     pin  v  mA
    4   2      pin  v  mA
      3        pin 3 Signal Ground
               pin  Demodulated signal Vpp  polarity  mA drive
               pin  Signal to drive repeater LED drives through 150ohm
                       resistor Vpp

I assume that the repeater connectors miniplugs drive the IR repeater
LEDs directly  True

Can anyone fill in the s  Thanks


Heres the scoop  When you get your home brew receiver working would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it

pin 1  signal ground
pin 2  signal
pin 3  always hot 6 volts
pin 4  6 volts hot only when preamp is turned on
pin 5  infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin 5  There
is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks with a 15K from pin 5 to
ground

The signal pin 2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver
They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver

If you need more info let me know
