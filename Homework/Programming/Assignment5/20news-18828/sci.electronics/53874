 Im looking for an IC that will convert RS232 voltage levels to TTL voltage 
 levels  Something relatively inexpensive would be nice too  Anyone have
 a suggestion  Thanks
 
 Well it looks as if DigiKey sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what
 you want  They are selling it for about 350

Are you sure that he needs a two way converter If he wants only
RS232TTL I would suggest the MC1489 its very cheap 080 DM in
Germany This chip needs only 5V The MC1488 TTLRS232Converter
uses 12V and 12V

BTW The MAX232 and compatibles seem to be expensive in the USA
I paid 295 DM for a ITS80272 made by Harris its absolutely
compatible with the MAX232 or the ICL232
