I just moved to NYC and wondered if there are any electronics hackers
out there who could point me to places in NYC that sell individual
electronic components switches pots transformers caps


Try Cables and Chips  let me dig out a reciept 

Here we are

Cables  Chips at 121 Fulton Street thats near South Street Seaport and 
Wall Street  Phone is 2126193132 and 8008434117

However when ordering there be VERY exact or theres a good chance theyll 
screw up  Otherwise theyre pretty good and they deliver too

Cheers
Rob
