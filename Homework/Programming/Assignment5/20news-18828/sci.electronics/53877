         I would like to know if any one had any experience with having
 onboard decoupling capacitors inside a cmos chip for the power
 lines Say I have a lot of space left im my pad limited design
 any data on the effect of oxide breakdown any info or pointers
 are appreciated

DEC did this on their new alpha chip  Im sure you could call them up
and ask them how they did it haha

Actually there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of
SolidState Circuits  I think it was sometime around Nov  1992
