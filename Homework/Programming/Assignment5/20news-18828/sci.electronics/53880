 Greetings
       
         Situation  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall  I dont
                     know the number of the line  And I dont want
                     to call up the operator to place a trace on it
 
         Question   Is there a certain device out there that I can
                     use to find out the number to the line
         Thanks for any response
                                                     Al
