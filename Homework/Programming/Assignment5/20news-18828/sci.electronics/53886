The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU just like their entire 8bit line
400 80012001400 1440 130xe 65xe computers as well as the 5200
game machine The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIAs for the joysticks Later model 2600
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years

Additionally I think the 2600 used 2K 4K and up to 8K of ROM for
their games I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with but I
would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM Think comes from a lot of hacking
with the 800 and 130xe computers And occasionally hacking with the
2600 fixing it for monitor composite video use and audio hookups
Also I tryed to make a cartridgeless system that stored the ROM into
a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time a way to
backup cartridges Ive heard of a setup like this where games could
be bought cheaply on FSKrecorded tapes then you would load them
into a special RAM cartidge and play them

Anyways if youre interested in looking for 2600 equipment weve got
two 2600 machines around one composite AV modified and lotsa
cartridges Willing to sell for reasonable offer  shipping and
handling Dont play it anymore since going to computers  Nintendo
interested in that too

Hope that helps your question I might grab some 6502s out too
since they must be fun to play with as microcontrollers
