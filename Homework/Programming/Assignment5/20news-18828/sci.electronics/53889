Subject Magstrip Card Reader Info


Can somebody please help me with information about an
American Magnetics Corporation Magstripe Card Reader that
I recently bought locally from a surplus dealer

On the rear it has the following information

	American Magnetics Corporation
	Carson CA USA
	Magstripe Card Reader
	Model 41
	PN 507500  2300112311

It is fitted with a cable with a RS232 Cannon 25pin connector on
the end and has a separate power connector like the once used with
wall chargers
