Subject speaker impedance help needed

           I want to connect a very small homemade speaker
up to the headphone jack on my macintosh LC for an experiment
The dc resistance of the speaker is 1 ohm  Any ideas how I can
do this safely  I think I need some kind of an impedance
transformer or something
