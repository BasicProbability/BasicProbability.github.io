Subject Re Los Angeles Freeway traffic reports

 While driving through the middle of nowhere I picked up KNBR AM 1070
 a clearchannel station based in Los Angeles They had an ad 
 claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from 
 all of the thousands of traffic sensors that CalTrans has placed
 under the pavement Does CalTrans sell this info Does KNBR have
 an exclusive Whats the deal

You were right the second time it is KNX Believe it or not I also
listen to KNX in the evenings here in Colorado Its kind of fun driving
through the country listening to traffic jams on the 405 Back to your
original question Yes there are sensors just past every onramp and
offramp on the freeways Theyre the same sensors used at most stoplights
now coils in the pavement You might want to give CalTrans a call or
even ask Bill Keene KNXs traffic reporter I doubt if just anyone can
get the information but it would be worth asking just in case you can
get it
