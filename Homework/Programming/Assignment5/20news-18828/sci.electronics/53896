Subject Re Laser vs Bubblejet

FYI  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1600th inch  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge however limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch
On almost any paper the ink wicks more than 1300th inch anyway

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology

It doesnt take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
US 7580 at discount while HP high capacity 5001000 page yield
cartridges are about US 22 at discount  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles
