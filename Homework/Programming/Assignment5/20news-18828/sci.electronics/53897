Subject Radar detector DETECTORS

Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers in
defiance to Virginias law against radar detectors passed out
thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
the Virginia State lines  At that time there were no radar
detector Detectors  I am not sure of the impact but I would
imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
radar detector became difficult  if not impossible

As I said earlier efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law
against radar detectors has been in vain  In fact effective
Jan 1 1993 the fine for possession of a radar detector
accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now 25000  

I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR100 2
meter ham transceiver It will make a cheap radar detector
scream  I am not sure of the range but it is obvious by the
brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts
