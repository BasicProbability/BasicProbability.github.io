Subject 8x oversampling CD player


Hello

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office and I notice that
it proudly proclaims 8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING on the box  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor
I dont understand this 8 TIMES business  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player was it REALLY 10 years ago the specs
said 4 TIMES   Could someone please tell me whether Im getting
senile  If Im not then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate  If I really wanted better fidelity wouldnt
I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording
process  Furthermore am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate
from the players point of view as being the same thing as the data
rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium  Does this mean
that the data rate related to the rotational speed of the disk has 
changed since 1983

Im so confused
