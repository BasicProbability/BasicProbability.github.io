  Hi there
  Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found
  on most arcade style games  Many projects I am working on would
  be greatly augmented if I could implement them  Thanx in advance


HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these  I dont remember which
suburb they are in  The prices are pretty reasonable and they are
easy to hook up  I bought a new coin mechanism from them for 2500
a couple of years ago
