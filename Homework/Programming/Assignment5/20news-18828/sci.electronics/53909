Subject Re Suggestions  on Audio relays 

In article C5qsBFIEKmsukyedu billqmsukyedu Billy Quinn writes
I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch
audio  I got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched 

	Is there a good relayrelay circuit that I can use for switching
audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio lines

	With relays alone you will always get a transient when
you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel  If you dont want to hear
the transient use some other device a photoresistoroutput optoisolator
is the usual sort of thing to gently MUTE the signal then switch
THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator

	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
in switching audio because the photoresistor time delay a few
thousandths of a second kept any noise in the digital side which
drives the lamp from contaminating the audio  And the devices
are cheaper than relays
