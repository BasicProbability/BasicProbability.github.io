   Greetings

	   Situation  I have a phone jack mounted on a wall  I dont
		       know the number of the line  And I dont want
		       to call up the operator to place a trace on it

	   Question   Is there a certain device out there that I can
		       use to find out the number to the line
	   Thanks for any response
