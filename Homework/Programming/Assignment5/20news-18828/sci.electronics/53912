    Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts  It is very unlikely however
    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car
 
 Not possible either  Youd need about a 300 amp alternator for
 just the amplifier
 
 It is too possible  As the original poster said it is very unlikely
 but definately possible  Can you say batteries


Ive even seen pictures of an installation where the ham pulled a little 
trailer behind his car with a 4KW generator and ran the full legal limit 
while mobile I dont know what his gas mileage was like though or 
where he found resonators able to stand the gaff
