Subject Re A question about 120VAC outlet wiring

Well my house was built just last year and the breaker box is wired the
same way  All the white and ground wires are on a common bus  Except for
the 220V circuits only black wires are hooked to the breakers  It was
the same way in the last two houses I had also  Are you sure this is wrong
I still have the building inspectors signature on the breaker box

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the outlet box big NO NO and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box as things should be

If this is not obvious the point is that there should be current
flow in the white ie neutralreturn wires when things in the
house are operating  There should not be any flow in the ground wires
unless there is a fault condition  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the abovementioned junction to earth ground
usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground
