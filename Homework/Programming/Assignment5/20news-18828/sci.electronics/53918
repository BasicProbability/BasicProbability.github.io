I have the ARRL Handbook for the Radio AMateur and Im getting the
Solid STate Design for the Radio Amateur

The handbook is 25 and Solid State is 12 from ARRL 225 Main Newington
CT 06111 but you should be able to find them at electronics or amateur radio
stores
ARRL will want 5 or so for shipping
Good Luck
