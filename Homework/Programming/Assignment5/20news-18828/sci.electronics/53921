Write a good manual to go with the software  The hassle of
photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing
the package for only 15  Also consider offering an inexpensive
but attractive perc for registered users  For instance a coffee
mug  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of
dollars so consider pricing the product at 1795

Or documentation for the program   A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach  send in your money and you get 
documentation and a free upgrade to the latest version  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree  Whatever you want to offer that is better 
than the circulating version

Youre lucky if only 20 of the instances of your program in use
are nonlicensed users

Figure about 50 as I have seen

The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into
your price structure  Sure it hurts legitimate users but too bad

It doesnt really hurt legit users  Shareware is still much cheaper than 
the alternatives
