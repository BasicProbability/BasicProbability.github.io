 drive the steppers through the 3479Ps no problem thats with the
 6wire steppers 2 to  and the other 4 are the phase lines  Problem
 1  Ive got some 4 wire steppers  I put the darkest line to  and the
 other 3 to the 3479P worked kinda  Tried it with a printer stepper
 moves the head back and forth 4 wires didnt work too well  It 
would
 shift back and forth use something like a 4017 instead  Also Ive 
been
 trying to get a bunch of NPNs to work with it NO LUCK tried 
PNPs

 my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER  ARGGG
