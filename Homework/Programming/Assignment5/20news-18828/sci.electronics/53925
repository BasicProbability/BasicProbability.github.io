Can anybody recommend a good applicationoriented beginners reference
to RF circuits  

I am pretty good on theory  know what different types of modulation mean 
but dont have a lot of practical experience  A book detailing working
circuits of different types modulation power frequency what is legal
what is not et cetera would be very helpful

Thanks
