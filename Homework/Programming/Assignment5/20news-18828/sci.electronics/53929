Subject Re how can 0022 uF be different from two 0047 in series

In article 1993Apr191853269830PrincetonEDU mgcsprincetonedu Michael Golan writes
The board itself is also identical with room for all three caps The
USCan versions is clearly indicated in both places

How does that make sense 00472 is 00235 essentially 0022 for caps
there are just standard caps no special Wtypeprecision 

This may be a safety issue the CSA is more paranoid in certain areas than
UL and such  Two caps in series means that you dont have a short if one
of them shorts
