I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
a MC146818A Real Time Clock
lowest current drain I can acheive at 37V Vcc is 150uA  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM
1 Made sure that RESET is asserted for Trlh after powerup and AS is
   low during this time
2 Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD or
   WR during which STBY was asserted

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL  Standbydrain specs
for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down
to zero or all the way up to Vcc  TTL isnt good at doing the former and
it wont do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors  This
sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable
factor because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF arent
all the way hard OFF
