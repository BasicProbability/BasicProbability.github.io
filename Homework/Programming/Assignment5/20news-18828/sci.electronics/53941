One other thing there are bubblejets and then there are BubbleJets
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
such as HPs dinky little BubbleJet whereas most produce really good
looking output such as HPs DeskJets  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets

PS  If youre in the market for a portable bubblejet printer I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet although Ive heard the portable
Canons are good too I needed PCL support myself  With the DeskJet
Portable you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot

I second that suggestion  Although I dont own the HP Portable Deskjet
I do own the HP Deskjet 500  It gives the nicest outputs with only
a minor loss of quality   For all intensive purposes papers letters
resumes I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer You do have to
look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters  Only one
grudge the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the
presence of moisture Even though the ink is waterproof  However
you would have to spend about 500 more for laser quality

The cannon bubblejets are nice however they dont seem to have as
much support eg drivers for popular programs as the HP inkjets
Also HP Deskjet regularplus500500c accepts xerox paper I believe
that the cutsheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet

If you dont mind refilling your printer with cheap ink say
fountainpen ink then the HP deskjets are very cheap to maintain
I paid 350 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9
months

		  very much

PS I have a question for you netters Im too afraid to refill with
the waterproof inks they sell in artsupply houses because I had brought
a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge I
wonder what is a good waterproof ink aside from buying refillkits
to refill my cartridge
