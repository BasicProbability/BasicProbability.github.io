I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job
of making schematic drawings  The program needs to be in
MSDOS Windows if possible

What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by
dragging elements onto the screen and in this the elements
needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs case with pins
It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the
components as well as their values  In other words I want to
produce quality drawings  Printout would be to either 24 pin
dotmatrix andor Laser Printer

I would suggest Draw for Windows by Micrografx  I have this on my
home box  Its quite impressive and only cost UKL100  It has a rather
nice clipart library facility which you can expand with your own
drawings  There is no circuit component clipart included but you
could add your own quite easily

It works with any Windows printer driver of course and can also
export embedded postscript and PCX files

Note I am not connected with Micrografx in any way
