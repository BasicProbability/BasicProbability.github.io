 My 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries  I was
 wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to
 construct a homebuilt battery  In my grade school days I remember seei
 the ice cube tray version but I dont remember what to use as a good
 electrolyte or what the easily obtainable metals were

 Thank you in advance

I remember watching a whole Mr Wizzard program on this subject when
I was a kid  The battery constructed on the program which made the
biggest impression on me and generated the most power was made using
a galvanized bucket for the zinc and a copper toilet tank float  The
electrolyte was sauerkraut

Take a lemon  Stick a copper strip into the lemon  Stick a galvanized
nail in about 1 to 112 inches from the copper strip  You should get
about 12 volt from it  enough to light an LED
