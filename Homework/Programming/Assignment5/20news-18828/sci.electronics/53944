Subject Food Dehydrators

Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators Ive been seeing
all over latenight TV recently I was wondering if they use forced air hea
or both If theres heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
My wife would like one and Im not inclined to pay 10000 for a box a fan
and a heater Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks Heck the technology is only what 1000 years old

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book The
Hungry Hikers Guide to Good Food by Gretchen McHugh  The heat source
is a 100 watt light bulb  Basically its a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom lots of them you want the air
to flow  The light bulb goes in the bottom and wire cake racks are
spaced every 6 starting about 10 above the bulb

Or at a slightly higher cost in electricity you can do what I do  Use
your oven  NOTE  I do this in an electric oven some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven  Set oven to 140 degrees the lowest setting on my
oven  if yours goes down to 120 thats probably even better  Stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch  this allows
for airflow  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours check it
often since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator  If you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks turn the stuff over halfway
through

If you want more info email me since this isnt really the right sub
for this stuff
