MJMHI I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
MJMsubjects I am currently learning about AMFM receivers and recieving
MJMcircuits I understand a lot of things but a few things I am confused
MJMabuot The first is the MIXER to mix the RF and local oscillator
MJMfrequencies to make the IF Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams as
MJMsimple as possible for this kind of mixer I have come across a
MJMMCSBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs
MJMACTIVEetc

MJMAlong the same note are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone
MJMmay have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see

MJMPS any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AMFM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED
MJMELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot
MJMI have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
MJMcircuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help

Digikey has the NE622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on
one chip

For a great combination of theory with actual circuits the best
reference for nonengineers is probably the Radio Amateurs Handbook
from the ARRL  Most librarys have it in the reference section
