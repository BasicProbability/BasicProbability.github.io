 I have notice a lot of electronics questions by people who are obviously not 
 tunedin to electronics  Many of them have rather simple answers and 
 many of them require a circuit diagram

 Rather than muck up the network why dont you write to me send a self
 addressed stamped envelop and Ill answer your questions if I can
