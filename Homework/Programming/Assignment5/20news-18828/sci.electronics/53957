Subject Voltage regulation and current limiting

One notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys

For our class project we need to design and build a power supply
to the following specs

Voltatge  adjustable from 112V
Current   limited at 1A

Voltage must stay within 2 of designated value for I from 01A
AC ripple less than 5 mV rms

Of course we cant just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting
regulator chip 

Our problem is with the current limiting ie weve found stuff to
do the rest of the parts of the circuit  What the supply must do
if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A given the
supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
one amp  Thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we
should read one amp  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm 
resistor at 12V we should read one amp and the output voltage by
necessity must be 1V

The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
power transistor and therefore reduce the output

So does anybody have any ideas we could work from

Thanks in advance

ps If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project I agree fully
    but I still have to do it its graded
