My main question is the bulb where can I get UV bulbs Do they
need a lot of power etc etc

Ive seen them in surplus stores  All they are are fluorescent bulbs 
without the phosphor and a UV transparent bulb special glass  Ive
also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC
socket probably not what you want


Im not too concerned with whether its longwave or shortwave
but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs Ill take both

One other thing a friend of mine mentioned something about nearUV
light being cheaper to get at than actual UV light Does anyone
know what he was referring to

As far as I know near UV as opposed to farUV is longwave UV near
the visible spectrum  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental I hope
exposure to the eyes  As far as fluorescent minerals go the reason a
friend has a UV lamp some only respond to only one of short or long UV

Hope this helps

Dave




Thanks much
