Subject Re decoupling caps  onboard


Ive used onchip capacitors to reduce groundbounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines
Design was in 2micron nwell cmos using the MOSIS scalable design rules
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors

1 They dont help much with simultaneous output switchingthere is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground
	return so you still get ground and power line bounce 

2 They do help a lot with onchip loads as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines 

3 The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency so forget about large areas of polythinoxidediff
	capacitors since the RC time constant is too large
	What I did is to make a metal2 metal poly diff sandwich
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer allowing frequent
	diffmetal1 contacts  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were  If I were doing this design again Id probably
	omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead
	using just m2 m1 and poly and substrate but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds

4 You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings especially for
	output signalling than spending chip area on capacitors
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed
