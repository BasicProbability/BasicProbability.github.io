For a project of my own I would like to build a InfraRed Remote control
receiver for regular VCRs and TVs remotes  Does anybody have any info
or tips on how to build such receiver 
In particular
a which photo detector should I use which wavelength do remotes use 
b which ICs or circuit should I use 
c any suggestions for circuit layout
 
 	Another suggestion  find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote
 and go look at the SAMS photofact for it  You can often find some very
 detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
 transmitter as well including carrier freq specs and tone decoding
 specs if the system uses that
 
Probably wont help  Id be willing to bet that every manufacturer
used those little selfcontained modules  I think Sharp made them
Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks maybe they still do

The module had 3 leads  power ground and demodulated output  It
contained the photodetector amplifier integrator and demodulator
all in a tiny metal can

If you want to buy one try Radio Shack or else a TV repair shop can
probably order one  BTW  the carrier frequency is 40 KHz and each
different TVVCRcable boxstereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse
scheme to perform each different function on their equipment
