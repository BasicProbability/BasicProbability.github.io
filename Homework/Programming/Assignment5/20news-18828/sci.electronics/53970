Subject Re Suggestions  on Audio relays 

In article C5qsBFIEKmsukyedu billqmsukyedu Billy Quinn writes
I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch
audio  I got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched 

	Is there a good relayrelay circuit that I can use for switching
audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio lines

I missed the first part of this thread are you switching line level or
speaker level audio
If line level theres a single chip 4x1 stereo audio switch available
that switches 4 twochannel inputs into 1 twochannel output and also
has a mute function all controllable with ttl inputs  LM1037 I think

If speaker level never mind
