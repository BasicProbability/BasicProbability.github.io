Subject Re arcade style buttons and joysticks

  Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found
  on most arcade style games  Many projects I am working on would
  be greatly augmented if I could implement them  Thanx in advance

HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these

Actually its HAPP and some of their equipment can be found in the 
Parts Express catalog 18003380531  They show switches for 2
joysticks for 13 and trackballs for 80  They also have pinball parts

Good luck
