Subject Can Radio Freq Be Used To Measure Distance

Im wondering if its possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitters and receiver

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance This would be for short distances 2000 ft
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches or so

How about measuring vertical distance as well any chance  or am I getting
ridiculous

What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter

Sorry if Im mucking up the network with one of those questions best
answered by Bill Willis via US Mail and I apologize for not being
tunedin to electronics
