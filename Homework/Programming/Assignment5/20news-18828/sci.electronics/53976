Subject Re Can Radio Freq Be Used To Measure Distance

Im wondering if its possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitters and receiver

Yes you could

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance This would be for short distances 2000 ft
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches or so

Well letsee whipping out HP48SX soon to be GX 6 inches3108 ms5
nanoseconds resolution  Hmm  Thatll be rather difficult

The more standard read better method is to use ultrasound generally
somewhere around 40kHz  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light
radio waves and is therefore much easier to deal with

What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter

It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous
sonic estimator type devices that do what you want here  Many are pretty 
cheap too  30  In fact for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling
for something like 8  Thats the one I bought
