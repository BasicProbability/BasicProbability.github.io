 Can anybody recommend a good applicationoriented beginners reference
 to RF circuits  
 
 I am pretty good on theory  know what different types of modulation mean 
 but dont have a lot of practical experience  A book detailing working
 circuits of different types modulation power frequency what is legal
 what is not et cetera would be very helpful
 
 Thanks

Well you might try the ARRLs license study guides For example my
Advanced Class study guide has lots and lots of good RF and electronics
theory in it I would imagine the other books are good too
