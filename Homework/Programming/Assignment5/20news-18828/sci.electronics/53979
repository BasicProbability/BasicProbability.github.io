	BTW I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 wattshonest
6 WATTS  I dont have the book here at work so I cant recall the company
name  The 6 watter aint cheap around 108 but if you want some power
mamamia thats pretty hot  They also have a 4 watt a 2 watt and a
1 watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals
If you are interested I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info
 

You are probably referring to the products of
		
		Opto Diode Corp
		750 Mitchell Road
		Newbury Park Ca 91320
		805 4990335

The make some amazing IRLEDs  The really highpowered devices are arrays of
3 6 or 9 LEDs on a TO66 header  The 9chip model puts out 65 Watts in
response to a 5 Amp 10 uS pulse at a 5 duty cycle  I think  these are
designed as illuminators for IR vision systems

I would also be interested in the application here  I work with a Dance and
Technology program and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
wide stage from 50 feet away
