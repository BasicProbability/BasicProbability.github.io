 One notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys

 For our class project we need to design and build a power supply
 to the following specs

 Voltatge  adjustable from 112V
 Current   limited at 1A

 Voltage must stay within 2 of designated value for I from 01A
 AC ripple less than 5 mV rms

To decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of
the limitercurrent and the allowed tempdrift

In the first case you can use a Ube of a transistor as a voltagereference
of about 07 VDC with a tempdrift of 2mVK In the second case its better
you use a bandgapref and a opampcircuit to detect the maximumcurrent
The output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current
