It appears to use two balancedline connections but what each connection
corresponds to I know not One connection is a 30way IDC the other a
60way IDC

Sounds like it is an SMD interface to me not being at work now
to actually count pins  there are two varients SMD  and
SMDC I think only minor differences between them  Widely used
prior to the advent of SCSI for large drives or all drives on minis
and mainframes no experience on those
