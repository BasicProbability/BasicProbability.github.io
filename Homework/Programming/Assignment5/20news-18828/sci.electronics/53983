I gather by offshore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
bluefin tunas who are into that squidfi sound  I agree on that one 
My Adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
running the chips class A resistor mod and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better but better sound unfortunately does not appear to be a priority 
with Adcom else the mods would neither have been necessary nor would they 
have improved what was already touted as superlative stateodart lesound 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an sp9II even an sp3a to a GFP555etc or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte amps for a GFA555etc  



I am one of those folks who traded UP from a 500 to an Audio Research SP9 II



Am I enjoying it Yes  The SP9 DOES sound better but at a price
