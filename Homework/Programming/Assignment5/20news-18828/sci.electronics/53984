What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments

    Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
octave 13 octave etc  Thus the 10kHz20kHz octave has the same
amount of noise power as the 10Hz20Hz octave
    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
Hz kHz etc  Thus the 10kHz101kHz band has the same amount of
noise power as the 10Hz110Hz band both bands are 100Hz wide
    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a 3dboctave
filter usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs
Note you cant get 3dboctave by using half a 6dboctave network 

    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements
It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers with octaverelated bands
as a flat line across the bands
