What is Pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments
tony

Pink noise is a random signal with more lowfrequency components
than white noise

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency
analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density is flat which
means that every frequency is present in the noise signal

Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of lowpass
filtering a white noise signal Therefore pink noise contains much more
lowfrequency components

The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring
animals An additional lowpass filter with variable cutoff frequency will
explain you why

Enjoy it
