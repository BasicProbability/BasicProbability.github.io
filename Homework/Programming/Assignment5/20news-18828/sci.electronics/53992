I just bought a new portable CD player for the office and I notice that
it proudly proclaims 8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING on the box  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor
I dont understand this 8 TIMES business  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player was it REALLY 10 years ago the specs
said 4 TIMES   Could someone please tell me whether Im getting
senile  If Im not then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate  

The data is only ever read once barring mistracks and such of course
and eventually gets turned into 441 KHz 16 bit two channel data
Oversampling takes two discrete data points and interpolates n1 points
between them for n times oversampling  When I asked people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation but significantly more
complicated

You are quite correct in your understanding  The filtering is not
interpolation as that would distort the frequency content of the signal

They do interpolate  its not linear interpolation though You are correct
that the frequency content is not altered more specifically the baseband
spectrum is preserved and so is every Nth image spectrum The other
N1 in N image spectra are removed where N is the oversampling rate

you are listening to  Generally these players run the samples thru an
allpass filter network  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a persons

Ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0Hz to 22050Hz and a gain of 0
from 22050 to the new Nyquist frequency In practice a finite transition
band is required and there is also a certain amount of passband ripple
and stopband leakage With a high order eg 200 taps digital filter
a very good approximation can be easily achieved

  BIT DELETED ABOUT OBSERVATIONS OF INTERPOLATION FILTER AT WORK 

In case you care the filtering method uses an FIR finite impulse response
filter  Id guess that CD makers use the same kind of method  Anybody out
there know the real answer  Id say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistoropamp weighting to accomplish the filtering  This strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs

No they actually use a digital FIR just like yours but built in hardware
on custom VLSI chips for mainly economic reasons

Anyway then the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective
sampling rate up to n times 441 KHz in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters  For the same quality filter higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters whereas for the same price filter higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters  So assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to antialias
filtering

Actually I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not  You can use sloppier components and
give the filter a rolloff that isnt so sharp   Its too bad that they
charge more for something that I think is actually less costly to build

I guess that the answer is somewhere between the two

As an interesting  aside some of you out there may be aware of a scheme
used by Pioneer and Wadia which is called by Pioneer at least Legato
Link I havent heard one of these players but by reading advertising
blurb and a couple of pseudotechnical articles I deduced that all they
do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter and let a load of the
first image ie aliassed spectrum through Talking to Bob Stuart of
Boothroyd Stuart aka Meridian confirmed my suspicion He said that it
sounded awful but then he would wouldnt he
