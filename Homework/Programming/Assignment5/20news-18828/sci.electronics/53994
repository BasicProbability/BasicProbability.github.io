Subject Re Can Radio Freq Be Used To Measure Distance

Im wondering if its possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitters and receiver

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance This would be for short distances 2000 ft
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches or so

This would be susceptible to fading multipath etc We used to use a
system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa It used a
10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured
The 10 GHz was just the carrier the real signals were several switched
ones around 75 MHz or so whose relative phases at the receiver would
read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed The units
came with psychrometers sp to measure the relative humidity and
instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp
They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end
Current technology uses polarized reflectors dual polaization TXRX
and psuedorandom coding of a radar pulse about the same resolution
at X band much better at 47GHz Only one end is heavy
