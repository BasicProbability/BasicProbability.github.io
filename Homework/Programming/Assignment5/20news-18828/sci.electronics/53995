   Can anyone tell me where it is possible to purchase controls found
   on most arcade style games  Many projects I am working on would
   be greatly augmented if I could implement them  Thanx in advance
 
 HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these
 						Andrew MacRae
 
 Actually its HAPP and some of their equipment can be found in the 
 Parts Express catalog 18003380531  They show switches for 2
 joysticks for 13 and trackballs for 80  They also have pinball parts


Youre right it is HAPP Controls Inc but you can buy direct from them  I
dont have a phone number with me but anyone interested in it can email me for
it  I dont remember their button price but the joystick price was 895
per dozen at last check  Should be slightly higher for one or two but cheaper
than Parts Express  As for the trackballs i dont know the new price either
But I can sell you rebuilt arcade trackballs for 50  That includes new rollers
and new bearings when nec  I also have a pile of used joysticks and buttons
that i would be willing to sell  Please email to address below if interested
