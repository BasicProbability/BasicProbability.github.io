TransAm Electronics Canal Street near 7th Ave  lots of surplus type
stuff

Theyve been out of busines for years

Several other electronics or surplus type places are still on Canal
Street

Not any more  About 2 years ago they all closed
When RamcoElectronics city closed it took weeks and many
dumpsters to clear everything out so I heard
There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires
but no chips capacitors or discrete stuff

SylvanWellington is still on Broadway and Canal but theyre
not cheap and not surplus  Its mostly a TV repairmans store
