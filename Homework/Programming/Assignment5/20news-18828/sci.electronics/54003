Subject Re Making up odd resistor values required by filters

In scielectronics idhnessiemccacuk Ian Hawkins writes
When constructing active filters  odd values of resistor are often required
ie something like a 314 K Ohm resistorIt seems best to choose common
capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded

Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade1
1215182233 etc   It is a common enough problem  yet I cant
recall seing a program that tells that RxRyRz gives Rq  starting with
q and finding prefered values xy and z

    Since youre worrying about the third decimal place I assume youre
using 1 tolerance resistors and capacitors
