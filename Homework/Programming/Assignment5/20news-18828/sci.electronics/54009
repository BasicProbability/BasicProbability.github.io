Hi people

OK heres my problem 
I keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which

alas I live in Australia  Could someone please inform me if I can get
these things over here and if so where and how much

The card is on page 15 of the last catalog I got The cost ranges
from 1900US to 8000US depending on size and range of wavelengths
