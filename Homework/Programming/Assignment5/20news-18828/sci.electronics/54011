Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
TV screen at 1200ths of a second  Is that possible  I thought the

Take a look over in altfolkloreurban  There is a thread about subliminal
messages on TV  The fact that subliminal messages dont work aside an image
cant be flashed on a TV screen fast enough to not be noticed

Well yes and no  The image cant be on the screen less than 130
of a second but a mixture of images thats about 90 of the field
that was supposed to be there and 10 of the subliminal addition
could be overlaid for one field producing the same overall effect to
our sluggish retinae of a discrete image projected for 1300 second

although like the previous poster I have to reserve my doubts
about the effectiveness of said discrete image in steering my
subconscious around
