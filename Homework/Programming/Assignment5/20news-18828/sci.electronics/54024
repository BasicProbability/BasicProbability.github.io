 Im wondering if its possible to use radio waves to measure the
 distance between a transmitters and receiver

Yes Its called RADAR
Well actually not quite Both Radar and RadioAltimeters measure distances
by measuring the time required to transmit a signal then receive its
reflection from a target Radar generally uses pulses while Radio Altimeters
use either pulses or a modulated continuouswave transmission In the case of
the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be made As an example
the original Bendix ALA52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 18 foot at 2500
feet altitude

Note however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster
originally asked about The problem with gaining accurate measurements between
a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate
time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter
triggers This cannot be wire connected since radio waves will actually
travel faster in freespace air in this case than wire the difference
is called the velocity factor of the cable So you need to resort to a
common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance etc Something
like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick triggering both
the transmitter and receiver simultaneously Sound expensive Not too bad
but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort

Why not go to a different method Surveyors use a laserlight system where again
the reflection time is measured Why not try this Sounds like something a PE
should know about anyway 

 Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
 and determine distance This would be for short distances 2000 ft
 and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches or so

This is actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter
varies from unit to unit there are variances in the antenna and transmission
line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit
over time You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system With
the radio altimeter this is also done but since everything is located at
one place it is much easier to do Note especially that the time base for
the RA receiver and transmitter is one unit also

Depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in
a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this
concept

Nope FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins That is unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength
This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes
Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong

 What frequencies would be best for this Or does matter

As high as possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance
attenuation of multipath signals Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies
around 4 GHz

Hope this helps
