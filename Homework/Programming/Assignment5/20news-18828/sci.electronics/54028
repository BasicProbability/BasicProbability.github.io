Subject Re Hi Volt from battery

You might want to get a disposible flash camera shoot the roll of film
then take it apart theyre snapped together We used a bunch of them
at my wedding but instead of sending the whole camera in I just took
the film out its a standard 35mm canister and kept the batteries
they use one AA battery Sorry I didnt keep any of the flash electronics
