Subject help me im not clever how to make power supply

I need to make a power supply that can take input from a 
cigarette lighter in a car 12v dc and drive 75 volts
at up to 30 amps I know enough to know that a simple
voltage divider with two resistors wont do it right Can
such a thing be made from RadioShackable parts without
too much difficulty

jps
bf

ps Ive looked for premade things like this at radio shack but
none of it seems to go any higher than about 800mA
