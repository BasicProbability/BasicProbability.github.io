 There are several types of copy protection and the point is to make  
sure the
 user is using a legitimate copy  The simplest and virtually foolproof  
way is
 for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed  
on
 some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a  
different
 machine NOT installed from original disks will not work  
 

Okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part  
on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself  
upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program wont run  
because its on a different computer

This is of course assuming that the program uses something in ROM like  
the BIOS serial number maybe and not a diskbased code number   
Obviously if the drive goes bad youll be reinstalling the stuff anyway

I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system   
We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  
machines both PC and Macintosh as well as administering a network of  
over 50 NeXT machines  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  
with ten PCs and ten Macs  Im not the manager but help him with  
admin often  IMHO copyprotection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  
than a major headache for the legitimate user  Anyone who wants a copy of  
your program and doesnt care about legality will get a copy  Period   
Pirate board or no pirate board  I too have friends who blatantly and  
quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their  
sleep

Lets consider what goes on in our lab  Almost daily we have at least one  
machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some  
setting or other on a piece of software  Admittedly we being students  
mostly are not the worlds most efficient and effective network  
administrators but we try  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  
partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to  
the average user and maintaining behindthescenes consistency is a  
real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  
different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  
disk

Often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do  
some partsswapping to get stuff working temporarily   

Well Ill cut to the chase and quit boring yall   

The point is often we have to reinstall software and copy configuration  
files etc from machine to machine  By far the easiest way we have found  
to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to then  
COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that  
machines type  This ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have  
ten IDENTICAL machines to work with  Having them networked simplifies  
this considerably as our major packages WordPerfect Windows etc are  
all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with

Often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor  
to one some or all of the machines for a special project  This is  
usually a handwritten or sharewareetc program similar to what I believe  
the original poster was asking about  The few we have had with copy  
protection schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  
  

In short dont waste your time with a copy protection scheme  Its sort  
of like outlawing guns  The criminals will get your program anyway and  
you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user  Write a good users  
guide and tech manual whatever else for your program PLEASE do this  
REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute  
the manual to LICENSED users  Jack the price to cut your losses but  
please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the  
costs of illegal copies far better than you and dont burden the  
legitimate user with a copy protection scheme


Sorry for the tirade but its been a long day here

 The program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine  
depends
 on the programmer  dont use a disk drive characteristic  If the  
user 
 did an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any  
way
 No document lookup no disk wearandtear
 
 I did not say that the originals would allow only one install  The  
users 
 conscience should do that
 
 I know Ill get flamed for this  But with the increasing number of  
casual
 users who either unknowingly or dont care about the software copyrights
 Its the truth  I have friends who ask me for copies of my latest  
games
 all the time and when I refused they went after somebody else  
casual
 pirating is becoming more of a problem  Some sort of copy protection  
will
 discourage the casual copying  Ive seen what some of my friends dug  
up
 somewhere  Latest and the greatest games all cracked WITHIN days of  
actual
 release  You know how many bytes you need to change in Xwing to  
disable
 the quiz  TWO  Yes TWO  And dont ask me which ones they are   
Determined
 pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not  
spread 
 that far since pirate boards are not that wellknown and easily  
tracked once
 found by authorities  It is the casual pirates that the copy  
protection is
 determined to discourage
 
 What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
 a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
 REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the  
above
 Two benefits 1 encourages registration 2 cuts down on pirating and
 makes it more traceable because if the patchs registration message is
 encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a
 stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus
 violated their license agreement
 
 This way the legitimate users who does not register will experience  
minimal 
 discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as  
only
 problem they have is they wont be able to restore to another computer
 
 The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and  
therefore
 gains full rights and can restore to different machines  On the other  
hand
 the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is 
 supposed to be  If this users copy was found to be somewhere it was  
not 
 supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement  Of  
course
 a hacker can break that eventually but thats not the point is it
