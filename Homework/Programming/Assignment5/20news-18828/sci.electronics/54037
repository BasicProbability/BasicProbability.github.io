Subject MOV advice please

Hello

Can somebody tell me what kind of MOVs are most useful for a computer
surge protector  Radio Shack have 2 types both rated 130V one for
a 10A current and the other for 20A  On the other hand commercial surge
protectors I have seen claim a clamping voltage of 330V400V which SEEMS to
me in imply a rated voltage of about 250V 250V  SQRT2353

What is the right kind

While at it ow important is really the EMIRFI module  Is there really any
noticable level of such noise in the power line

Please  EMAIL to me as this group has too much volume for me to be able
to follow

Thanks
