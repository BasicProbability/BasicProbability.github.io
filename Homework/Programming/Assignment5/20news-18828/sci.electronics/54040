 My car unfortunately has so much computer junk under the hood that  
its
 astonishingly sensitive to RFI  
 
 Hmmmmm this has possibilities
 If the police are in pursuit of a vehicle maybe they can bombard it  
with
 high energy RFI  
 
 Right So all the cops will be buying antique muscle cars for chase  
cars
 otherwise the police cars will die too

I wonder if you could focus the RFI gun so the cops wouldnt have this  
problem
