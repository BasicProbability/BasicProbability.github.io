 There is or was a microwave tower next to Floridas Turnpike and you
 could watch the cars hit the breaks as they came in sight of it every
 morning
 

Funny    I and most of the detectorowning friends I have are  
generally able to REMEMBER such things as nearby microwave towers and  
radar detectors going off in EXACTLY the same spon EVERY DAY   

I know on I64 at the Grayson KY exit theres a store just off the side  
of the road think its a Liquor store    with what must be a security  
system that would make most federal prisons proud  Its the only thing  
Ive ever driven by besides a cop that puts my Whistler in Oh my God  
hes Right Behind You mode     I simply ignore the detector and  
use my eyes when I drive by that store    40 seconds later alls quiet  
on the front and no problem
