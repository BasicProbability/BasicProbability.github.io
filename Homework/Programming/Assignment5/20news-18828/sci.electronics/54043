Subject Contracts


 For my computer law module I have been asked to write a computer 
   contract for the supply of computer software to a business The
   software is being especially written for the company

   Would anyone per chance happen to have a copy of a computer
   contract on their system which they could mail me

   If anyone has a computer contract but it contains sensitive 
   material then I can assure them that it will remain confidential
   and I will not pass it on or allow anyone else to view it

   Thanks
