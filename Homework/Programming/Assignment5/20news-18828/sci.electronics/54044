   Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
 when stored on a concrete floor  

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals

The same thing happens to my car Citroen 2CV  damp gets under the
bonnet US hood and shorts the sparkplugs to earth so it wont start

The solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with
WD40 moisture repellant  If damp is the problem then storing the 
battery off the ground may help  Im not sure if spraying with WD40
would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum

Just a thought
