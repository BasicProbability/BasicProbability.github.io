Subject Re UART needed really BREAK detect

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a character containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt  This

True enough but

means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot which basically indicates a BREAK  There is no special way to
detect BREAK that I have found other than this  theres no magic signal
generated by UARTs etc

Zilog SCC

	RR07  Break Detect

This is a very popular part but it has a number of quirks especially
in HDLC mode

Signetics 68562 DUSCC

	RSR2  Break Start Detect
	RSR3  Break End Detect

Two of the bits in the Receiver Status Register  You can enable an interrupt
on either of these bits going high too  Also only one NULL will be put
in the FIFO per break detected

This is simply the best serial chip Ive ever worked with  Many less
quirks than the SCC which is IMHO secondbest  Death to 8250 devices
