I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection
schemes

I would expect that CDROM software would not even need copy protection
As the program on a CDROM would not fit onto a harddrive and it is
impossible for the average and even notsoaverage user to write to a
CDROM copies of the software that still work could never be made

Hmmm now that I think about it with a creative TSR maybe
diskswapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk You
would need a tonne of disks though
