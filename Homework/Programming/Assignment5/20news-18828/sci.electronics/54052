Subject Re Building a UV flashlight

The simplest and cheapest soft UV bulb is an AR1 argon bulb or other argon
bulb  It works like a neon bulb except it glows purple  It will cause
stuff to fluoresce  It requires very little power just a battery an
oscillator and a stepup transformer to about 100 volts

Electronic Goldmine 602 4517454 has several UV lamps both as prebuilt
units and kits  Ask for their catalog
