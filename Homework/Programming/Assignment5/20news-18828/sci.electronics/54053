   Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts  It is very unlikely however
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  Ham rigs

Not possible either  Youd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier  I can just see it  You need to slow
down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button

Now that indeed is possible  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW
PeP from his car  Yes he does have a second alternator  Yes he calls
the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio but I seem
to remember that PeP is actually 4x the real power  Which makes 1KW PeP
actually around 250W  Or was it 2x  I disremember

Effective transmitted power is also odd in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron
might advertise a megawatt if their antenna is on the top of the
CN tower 

This is like Sears HP 

Though 1500 real watts still isnt impossible  About 125150A with
a 12V alternator less if the alternator produces higher voltages

Its only three horsepower taking into account inefficiencies  Youll
feel it when you hit the key  But not too much
