ALThere is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
ALvoice telling you the number of the line  Unfortunately for the
ALlife of me I cant remember what it is The telephone technicians
ALuse it all the time  We used to play around with this in our
ALdorm rooms since there were multiple phone lines running between
ALrooms

It probably wouldnt help for you to post the number since it appears
to be different in each area  For what its worth in the New Orleans
area the number is 9988776655 easy to remember what


  SLMR 21  Ask me anything if I dont know Ill make up something
                                          

Here in our city dialing either 9407222 newer exchanges or 9402222222 
sic will get a synthesized message Works great for having people call you 
back at unlabeled pay phones

Regards
Bill
