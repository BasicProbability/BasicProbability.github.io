 I hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not
 because I want to copy the program but because its usually faster and
 and convenient than sifting through an old book I cant find

Just MHO but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and  
reference them while using the program fullscreen  The Windows Help  
things come closest to good online documentation Ive seen but they  
generally arent detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
space even compressed which is at a premium on my system     In  
fact the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borlands C compiler  
instead of using the one the lab licensed in the lab of course  Ive  
got a SHELF full of books to help me out when Im stuck     To each  
his own    

 
 Off deeper end Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
 backup copy Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk
 so you are left with the originals as your backups I think its a waste
 of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
 out the backups 

Weve destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac 50 and  
Word for Windows may have been a bad batch of disks  Dont have the  
faintest idea what happened to them they just went bad  Werent stored  
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated indeed they were only  
used once  Given this and the massive headaches finding a working set of  
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down Id say  
having working backups is a godsend  I sure wish wed had them Sometimes  
I think Murphys Law holds true more often than Newtons when we needed  
them  I think its sortof like snake antivenin  99995 of the time you  
have absolutely no use for it but when you need it BOY do you ever need  
it

I dont have backups of my originals at home but then my machine doesnt  
see anywhere NEAR the useabuse of these here at the lab and so I  
consider it less of a risk  Still I usually make working copies of  
them when I install them and then eventually reuse these working copies  
for something else  


 
 
 No flames intended  just my thoughts

Just mine too  

BTW before anyone notices my mentioning copying programs from machine  
to machine when we do installs here and wonders about the licensing the  
uppermanagement nonstudent staff of course are METICULOUS in checking  
with providers of the software and making SURE we are sticking to the  
license agreements
