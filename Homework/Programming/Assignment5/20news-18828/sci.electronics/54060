 Question about packet radio deleted 

                         Georgia State University  4046512390

How about recradioamateurpacket  At least at my site there is no
general packet radio ie nonamateur newsgroup

That said I would definately subscribe to rrapacket if you want to
learn about all aspects of amateur packet radio at both the high and
low ends  Also I would get the FAQ from the group and then post any
specific questions to that group  Everything I could tell you is 
probably in the FAQ and the people who really know whats going on all
seem to be on rrapacket although they might be here too you never know 

Hope it helps
