	How does the radio Electronics free information cards work
Do they just send you some general information about the companies that
advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a
catalog 

RadioElectronics sends each company a bunch of computerprinted address
labels for all the people who circled that companys number

The company sends whatever it wants to  normally a catalog
