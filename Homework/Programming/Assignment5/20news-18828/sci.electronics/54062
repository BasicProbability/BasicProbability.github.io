  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them
but he couldnt tell me why

This topic was beaten to death a year or so ago

The concrete is not the problem 

Leadacid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long
time but theres no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
problem
