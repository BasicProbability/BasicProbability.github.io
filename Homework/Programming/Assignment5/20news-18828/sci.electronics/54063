Subject Re How to the disks copy protected

In article 1r7h1ro7puniwauwaeduau ascotttartarusuwaeduau Andrew Scott writes
I would expect that CDROM software would not even need copy protection
As the program on a CDROM would not fit onto a harddrive and it is
impossible for the average and even notsoaverage user to write to a
CDROM copies of the software that still work could never be made

Hmmm now that I think about it with a creative TSR maybe
diskswapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk You
would need a tonne of disks though

There are many programs on CDROM that fit on a harddisk not all software 
is that big but were getting there
