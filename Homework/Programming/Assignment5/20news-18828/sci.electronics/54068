Subject Re Making up odd resistor values required by filters

idhnessiemccacuk Ian Hawkins writes

When constructing active filters  odd values of resistor are often required 
ie something like a 314 K Ohm resistorIt seems best to choose common 
capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded

Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade1
1215182233 etc   It is a common enough problem  yet I cant 
recall seing a program that tells that RxRyRz gives Rq  starting with 
q and finding prefered values xy and z

I once wrote such a program in BBC basic It was very crude and took
around 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search with a small amount of 
intelligence and told you the best combination Rq and the best below Rq

If you want to write one just store the prefered values in an array and
then search the solution space using three nested loops Im sure you
could knock this up in an hour
