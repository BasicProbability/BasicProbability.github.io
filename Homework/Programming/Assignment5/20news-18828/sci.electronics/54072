    Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
  when stored on a concrete floor  

I think its because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is
not being charged or discharged I remember some advice from an ancient car
manual guide my father had which was to use car batteries to power a garage
clock or something similar when theyre not in a car This is supposed to 
prevent the oxidation but Ive no idea if it really works The concrete floor
connection is a red herring

 
 It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
 by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals

This may contribute to discharging but would be reversible
 
 
 The same thing happens to my car Citroen 2CV  damp gets under the
 bonnet US hood and shorts the sparkplugs to earth so it wont start
 
 The solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with
 WD40 moisture repellant  If damp is the problem then storing the 

Well this is offtopic but back in the days when I used to drive bangers
I never found WD40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth didnt do
I think the effectiveness of WD40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns
the company

 battery off the ground may help  Im not sure if spraying with WD40
 would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum
 
 Just a thought
