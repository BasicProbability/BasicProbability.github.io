I need to make a power supply that can take input from a 
cigarette lighter in a car 12v dc and drive 75 volts
at up to 30 amps I know enough to know that a simple
voltage divider with two resistors wont do it right Can
such a thing be made from RadioShackable parts without
too much difficulty

jps
bf

ps Ive looked for premade things like this at radio shack but
none of it seems to go any higher than about 800mA

gt4417aprismgatechedu   ask for Scooter Technologies and receive

See if Radio Shack has a National Semiconductor Adjustable Voltage 
Regulator National part number LM350T or LM350K  These devices are 
rated for an input to output differential of up to 35 Volts  3 Amps

DigiKey Corp has these parts as well as several other useful regulators
If you dont have their catalog their phone number is 18003444539

I can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 75 VDC nicad battery 
with this device and if Im right you may want to look through some of the 
hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits first

If you get stuck email me your FAX number if you have one and Ill send 
you some suggestions or schematics
