Subject Switching PS questions


	Greetings Ive recently decided to chuck the linear regulators
	and learn the black magic art of switching power supplies
	before anyone flames me I KNOW both have their place 

	Anyways Ive built the basic up  down converters with pretty
	good results 80 efficiency but Im running into problems
	when I try to design  build anything that puts out serious
	amps I know it can be done I have some 5V200A guts on my
	bench but something puzzles me Im using a simple choke as 
	the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding
	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings
	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
	the usual errorfeedback but some of the others seem to loose
	me What are they for Better than that anyone have a full
	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of Id
	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
	low volume 

	My other problems in getting high amps  good efficiency are
	1 Lack of sources of ideal components calculated and 2
	Limited knowledge of the whole topic Im doing this on my
	own not school mind you in fact I have yet to take any
	course that covers transistors 

	So is the answer to 1 the accumulation of dead commercial
	models and truning into a scavanger not that its not what
	Im doing now and 2 getting  understanding schematics
	and a bit more of the mindboggling theory 

	Take care

	PS My goal is 12V  25A in car battery  250VAC out and
	on the other end 250V  5VDC  5A 5V  1A 12VDC 8A
	and 12VDC 1A the distance between the two will be
	more than 100 feet of 1416 gauge but less than 300 feet
	Would like to have a working model in a year or so  
	Do I have a chance to make it

 All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only 099 so respond NOW
