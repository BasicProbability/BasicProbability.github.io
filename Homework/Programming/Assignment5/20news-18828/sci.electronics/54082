 The concrete is not the problem 

 Leadacid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long
 time but theres no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
 problem

Ditto The only remote and I do say remote possibility is that if the
ground was REAL cold  30F the battery might freeze an split But then
it would probably freeze anyway
