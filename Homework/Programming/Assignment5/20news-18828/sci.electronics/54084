Subject CALLERID chip info requested

I just got callerid except Bell calls it call display and didnt know
what I was talking about when I asked for callerid  I got the
cheapest display box I could find and hope to convert it to serial out

The chip used is an 18pin DIP marked CDT 14285 and 1473 9220
I presume the 9220 is the date

Im hoping somebody out there knows something about this chip to save
me a very strange few hours hooked up to a scope asking my friends to
call me again and again

Ill post any interesting replies and my experiences
