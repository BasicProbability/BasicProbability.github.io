Subject Question on addressing

 
 
     I have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip
particulary a 27C512 EPROM  Although I dont know that much about it as I
understand it theres a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks
up the address  The question is how do you determine how many bytes the
address is incremented by  For example if I have code I want to be
accessed at 2000 and also at say 4000 how do I move the address pointer to
those positions  Thanks for any info
