Much deleted about assembly in USA vs other 
I wish to focus on the subject of warmrunning amplifiers

    Sure the amp runs very fairly
    hot  but thats how you get an amp to sound incredibly good
 
  An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how its gonna sound
  The amp you have probably is running ClassA the whole day
 
  because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
  to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs  Hmmmmm
 

There is a correclation between warmrunning amps and good sound
or in your words it DOES have a bearing on

Now I dont suggest that everyone run out and create combination
stoveamplifiers that will degrade lifespan
but a coldrunning circuit is much more suceptible to temperature
variation with varrying current than is a warmrunning one  And since
junction resistance is a function of temperature this has a detrimental
effect on linearity  

a few facts
bias points vary with temperature
junction resist varrie with temp
Adcom products do NOT run classA

If you still dont beleive this assertion consider the warmup requirements
for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier
warmup  On many designs its quite audible on mine about 20 minutes for
the output stage many hours for the drivers  Fortunately the drivers
are not switched

In any experiment or when drawing conclusions from listening
betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias
idle current level  Both have a positive correlation with low
distortion and good sound quality and high bias results in
warmer operation all other factors being equal
