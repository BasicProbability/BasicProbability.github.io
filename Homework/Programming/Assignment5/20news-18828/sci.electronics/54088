Subject Re Suggestions  on Audio relays 

In article C5qsBFIEKmsukyedu billqmsukyedu Billy Quinn writes
 I built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch
 audio  I got pretty bad clicks when the thing switched  I was doing
 most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
 nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks
 
 My question is
 
 	Is there a good relayrelay circuit that I can use for switching
 audio so that there will be NO noise of any kind on the audio lines
 
 I will appreciate any advice or references to advice  Also exact part
 numberscompany names etc for the relays will help

The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component intentional
or not on the audio lines to be switched If neither the output or
input presents an unintentional DC level lets say theyre capacitively
coupled then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground and
from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any
coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click

If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than
just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the DC before
switching with coupling capacitors of your own

If you have more than one relay each relay switching one input
through to a common output you can use makebeforebreak switching
where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch
change This may mask the switch click

An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and
making your own ersatz optoisolator with a lightdependent resistor LDR
sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink Many broadcast consoles
use this older but timehonored technique Claro actually makes
a complete optisolator like this but I dont have a part number handy
Radio Shack has a LDR grabbag 2761657 you might want to try

For a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try 
looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available or its
older predecessor the 4016 Again the DC component must be removed
prior to switching Other alternatives include JFET switches both discrete
and IC and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly
All the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily
make a subject for a multipage article

Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on
due to charge being injected into the audio line through device
capacitance when the control signal changes state Techniques to
minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through
the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the
control pulse With the 4016 cutting the click can be as simple as
putting 10K  47K resistors in series with the control pins

Hope this helps at least get you started
