 The program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine depends
 on the programmer  dont use a disk drive characteristic  If the user 
 did an upgrade to the machine heshe should reinstall all programs any way
 No document lookup no disk wearandtear

	This is not a good idea I upgraded my motherboard last fall  I
would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to
reinstall simply because I changed motherboards

	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum  Are you
going to require that a user reinstall all their software if they add 4Mb
of RAM to their computer  I did that a couple of weeks ago  Its in the
BIOS and if software had told me this isnt the machine you installed me
on I would never have used that software again  Really bad idea

 I did not say that the originals would allow only one install  The users 
 conscience should do that

	This is silly  Its much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then give
them that  Your scheme isnt going to stop anyone

 You know how many bytes you need to change in Xwing to disable
 the quiz  TWO  Yes TWO  And dont ask me which ones they are

	Do you know any assembly language at all  All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a JMP instruction
to just completely skip it  Not that difficult really  And there is very
little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing  Using PKLITE or
some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed EXE
were tagged as uncompressable

 What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
 a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
 REGISTERED TO XXXXX  address city state zip and disables the above

	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post  Making it
plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates But the
determined ones are just going to answer Joe Blow to the question of
whats your name so this wont stop them in the long run

	Pirates are always going to win this fight  They simply have more
time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme
