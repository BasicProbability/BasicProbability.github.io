Subject info wanted about standard phone line

greetings
Im a novice in this area Im trying to gather info on standard
phone line settings
quick questions 
       if I just want to send out a beep over the phone lines
        can I do it with some function generator  tie it up to
        one of those phone wires 
       which one of those wires should I connect to my DTMF chip
        as AUDIO IN 
 
any help would be much appreciated
 
Thankx in advance  Handy Trisakti
