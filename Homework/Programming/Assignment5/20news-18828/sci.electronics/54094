 One notsoquick question to throw out there for you guys
 
 For our class project we need to design and build a power supply
 to the following specs
 
 Voltatge  adjustable from 112V
 Current   limited at 1A
 
 Voltage must stay within 2 of designated value for I from 01A
 AC ripple less than 5 mV rms
 
 Of course we cant just use an adjustable voltage currentlimiting
 regulator chip 
 
 Our problem is with the current limiting ie weve found stuff to
 do the rest of the parts of the circuit  What the supply must do
 if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A given the
 supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
 one amp  Thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we
 should read one amp  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm 
 resistor at 12V we should read one amp and the output voltage by
 necessity must be 1V
 
 The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
 a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
 power transistor and therefore reduce the output
 
 So does anybody have any ideas we could work from
 
 Thanks in advance

 ps If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project I agree fully
     but I still have to do it its graded 
 

You can design for ramp shutoff brickwall current limit or even 
foldback cutoffsounds like you want BRICKWALL current limit

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base 
drive In order to get the brick wall you need enough voltage gain on 
the current sensor  Normally a darlington on the current sensing 
resistor will be adequate but for infinite gain use an op amp to sense 
the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to 
turn off the base bias on the seriespass transistor  Phase compensation 
may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more 
than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK
