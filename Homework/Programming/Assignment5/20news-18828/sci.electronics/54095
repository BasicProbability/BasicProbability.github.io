Subject Re Making up odd resistor values required by filters

idhnessiemccacuk Ian Hawkins writes

 When constructing active filters  odd values of resistor are often required 
 ie something like a 314 K Ohm resistorIt seems best to choose common 
 capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded
 
 Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
 a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade1
 1215182233 etc   It is a common enough problem  yet I cant 
 recall seing a program that tells that RxRyRz gives Rq  starting with 
 q and finding prefered values xy and z

WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1 you 
need a trimmer or to screen devices it cant be made from adding 2 
resitors of 1 value in parallel since the smaller device will have the 
error of 1 to cope with 
You have 3 choices
a live with the error of 1 tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low 
sensitivity designs
b buy resistors with better than 1 tolerance VishayDale
c use trimmers or SOTs SelectOnTest
