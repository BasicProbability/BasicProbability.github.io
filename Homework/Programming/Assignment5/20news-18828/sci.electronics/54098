Subject Re Lead Acid batteries  Concrete

The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold  The temperature
combined with selfdischarge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of 
the battery  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesnt
go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite
cooler
