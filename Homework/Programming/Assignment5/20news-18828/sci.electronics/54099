 Not that the question is anything important but I am still curious
 Why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green I have seen
 a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc Is there a
 technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
 not tought about it yet

The color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it

Original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown
Phenolic spelling was a tan
Most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green
Filled fiberglass is blue
Teflon is white

As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them  First boards were
used mainly in audio circuitry  Couldnt be used in high voltage or RF because
it would arc and burn  Most boards today are fiberglass the type being chosen
by its use and cost  

Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon and ceramic as the
fiberglass and other boards are conductive they actually work more as a 
capacitive dialectric but the word conductive simplifies explaination at the
high frequencies

Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections
is a thin flexible mostly mylar material and is used to connect the front of
the vehicle etc to the back instead of wiring harnesses  Camcorders use this
to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance

Am working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board
is gold plated boy it looks expensive

Hope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read

My education was pretransister
