Subject Re Lead Acid batteries  Concrete

In article 9649tekig7PENTEKCOM alanytekig5pentekcom Alan Yelvington writes
 The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold  The temperature
 combined with selfdischarge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of 
 the battery  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesnt
 go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite
 cooler

Please explain how cement is able to maintain a lower average temperature
than dirt  Sheesh
