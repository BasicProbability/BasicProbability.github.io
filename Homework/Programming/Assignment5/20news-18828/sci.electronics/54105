      Does anyone know the pinouts for the 27C512 EPROM  I have bought
 several of them none of which has come with the pinouts  Any info would be
 appreciated

A good source of information for data of this type is the library
In particular the library at a local college or technical school offering
courses in electronics would have data books of this nature
