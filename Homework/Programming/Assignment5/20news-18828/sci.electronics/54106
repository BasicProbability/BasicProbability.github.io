Subject FOR SALE OMTI 3527  ST506 RLL to SCSI adapters


I have 2 OMTI 3527 SCSI adapters for sale  These make an ST506 RLL drive
look like a SCSI disk drive  Each adapter will support two RLL drives  I
have used this model OMTI adapter with my Amiga A500 and a CLtd SCSI host
adapter without problems Im selling these because I got them about the
same time I decided to sell instead of expand my Amiga so I have never even
used them  I cant guarantee they will work with every SCSI host adapter

They are essentially new in box I paid 150ea make me an offer
