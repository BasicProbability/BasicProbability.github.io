      I have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip
 particulary a 27C512 EPROM  Although I dont know that much about it as I
 understand it theres a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks
 up the address  The question is how do you determine how many bytes the
 address is incremented by  For example if I have code I want to be
 accessed at 2000 and also at say 4000 how do I move the address pointer to
 those positions  Thanks for any info

Judging by your sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge
Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available
via anonymous ftp at csusedu

Since youve chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a multicart
To do this simply
1 Load the game images into the EEPROM at 2000 4000 etc Your EEPROM
burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into
one file yourself with suitable gaps
2 Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game
console and the high bits going to switches to choose between games

To directly answer your question above the pin that kicks up the address
is simply another address line

For a concrete example with the 27C512 and 8K games images you would
wire A0A12 to the cartridge and A13A15 to 3 switches  The 3 switches
would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM
