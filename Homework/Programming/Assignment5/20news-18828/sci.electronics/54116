  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them
but he couldnt tell me why

This topic was beaten to death a year or so ago

The concrete is not the problem 

Leadacid batteries often fail from disuse not being charged for a long
time but theres no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
problem

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder leadacid battery selfdischarges at a slightly faster rate Thats
why the old wives tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast  it insulates the battery
thermally It youll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will
selfdischarge even slower The best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly but also tricklecharge it every couple days too to shallow
cycle the charge in the battery Such mild exercising of a leadacid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage If you do remove the electrolyte may sure you keep separate storage
containers for each cells electrolyte and put it back into the same cells
when you refill the battery This isnt so critical for a brandnew battery
in a fully charged state but will maximize the restored output of an older
battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   
storage
