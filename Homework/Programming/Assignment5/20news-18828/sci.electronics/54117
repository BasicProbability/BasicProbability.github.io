   I was just wondering one thing actually two  I hope that this is the
proper place to post this subject

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable
when stored on a concrete floor  
  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year to preserve them and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that cause it ruins them
but he couldnt tell me why

I dont see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the
battery

However you would have been better off leaving them outside Keeping
them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside
A warm battery will selfdischarge faster than a cold one

When you are storing a battery its a good idea to charge it once a month
Letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it I suspect this is
what caused your problems
