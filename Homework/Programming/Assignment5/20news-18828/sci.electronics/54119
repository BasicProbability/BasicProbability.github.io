Subject Selfdestructing copy protection on VHS tape


Hi folks

I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
original I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different
processes However Ive never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I dont 
want to take the chance even its small

Anyone has experience in this kind of selfdestructing video tapes

Thanks in advance
