	Do you know any assembly language at all  All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a JMP instruction
to just completely skip it  Not that difficult really  And there is very
little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing  Using PKLITE or
some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed EXE
were tagged as uncompressable

And even that doesnt help there are at least two programs available
that fixes this UNP and DISLITE both available from Simtel20 And
even without them it isnt THAT hard to fix
