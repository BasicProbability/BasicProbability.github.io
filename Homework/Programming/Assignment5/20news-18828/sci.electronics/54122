  Does anybody out there have one of those food dehydrators Ive been seeing
all over latenight TV recently I was wondering if they use forced air heat
or both If theres heat involved anybody know what temperature they run at
My wife would like one and Im not inclined to pay 10000 for a box a fan
and a heater Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together
for just a few bucks Heck the technology is only what 1000 years old
