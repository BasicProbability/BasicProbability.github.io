 Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion Im saying that you register
 via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you
 the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card

The problem with this scheme is that when I buy a game I want to play it
THAT daymailing a card to and from California would probably take a week
or more
