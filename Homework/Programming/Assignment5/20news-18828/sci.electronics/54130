Im working on an audio mixer project but Im having trouble finding
parts  I want to use opamps for the gain control stages  The ones
I have found that are good for audio are LM739 and LM833 but I cannot
find either of these in the electronic parts places Ive looked

Are there any good substitute opamps andor are there any parts
suppliers in the LA area that carry this kind of thing 10KOhm dual
audio taper slider pots would be nice too

Any info would be appreciated  Thanks in advance
