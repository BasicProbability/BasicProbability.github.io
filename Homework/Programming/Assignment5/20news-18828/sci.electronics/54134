	I wrote a commercial program called GAMEMAKER can you guess what
it does  What we do is have a document protect answer Question on page x 
line y which is a real pain  We also allow the user to register by sending
in a card and computing a  based on their name  The system works in that
weve gotten lots of registration cards
	I hear that the program has been cracked though  Someone two people 
actually called up my supportone with a question the other wanting to
buy our graphics libraries right  Anyway if anyone wants to help me
catch a cracker and has the cracked version mail me  I wont accuse
you unless youre the cracker of course
