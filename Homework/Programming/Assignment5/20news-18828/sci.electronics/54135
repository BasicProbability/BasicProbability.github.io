        So whats the story here were all stuck with the regular
green red and off yelloworange LEDs  What gives
        Anybody have a scoop on FAIRLY LOW PRICED BLUE LEDs


In order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 26 to 28 electron Volts According to my physical
electronics prof you cant get an LED with that band gap Thats why you

Hes mistaken They exist the semiconductor is silicon carbide and they
are inefficient and expensive The bandgap is around 27 ev

dont find blue LEDs or for that matter some other colour of LEDs That
is not to say that blue LEDs cant be found  Ive seen blue LEDs sold
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering
They didnt emit very much light

The ones I have are clear plastic Pray tell what would make a typical
LED emit blue light
