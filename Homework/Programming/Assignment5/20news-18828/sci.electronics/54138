Subject Looking for Toshiba TA6267 specs

Im looking for some specs for a Toshiba TA6267BP  It appears
to be a power amp housed in a 7pin inline package and is used
in my Mitsubishi VCR circa 1985 as a DC motor controller for
the tape drive

Checking in the oldest IC Master I have 1990 I dont see it
listed and it appears to have been discontinued  If anyone
has anything on this part Id be greatly indebted

thanks in advance
