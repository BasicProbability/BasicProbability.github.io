    Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts  It is very unlikely however
    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car  Ham rigs
 
 Not possible either  Youd need about a 300 amp alternator for
 just the amplifier  I can just see it  You need to slow
 down on a downgrade  so you hit the push to talk button
 
 Now that indeed is possible  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW
 PeP from his car  Yes he does have a second alternator  Yes he calls
 the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
 key is down
 
 It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio but I seem
 to remember that PeP is actually 4x the real power  Which makes 1KW PeP
 actually around 250W  Or was it 2x  I disremember
 
 Effective transmitted power is also odd in that it takes into account
 antenna height and geometry  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron
 might advertise a megawatt if their antenna is on the top of the
 CN tower 
 
 This is like Sears HP 
 
 Though 1500 real watts still isnt impossible  About 125150A with
 a 12V alternator less if the alternator produces higher voltages
 
 Its only three horsepower taking into account inefficiencies  Youll
 feel it when you hit the key  But not too much

It sorta depends on what you drive I remember running a two channel 
Motorola with a vibrator power supply and about 40 tubes in a 1958 
Volkwagen The poor little 6 V generator had a heck of a time and if you 
keyed the mic at night you needed to be stationary because your lights 
got AWFUL DIM Isnt progress wonderful
