In order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 26 to 28 electron Volts According to my physical
electronics prof you cant get an LED with that band gap Thats why you
dont find blue LEDs or for that matter some other colour of LEDs That
is not to say that blue LEDs cant be found  Ive seen blue LEDs sold
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering
They didnt emit very much light

Um

1 Your Professor if just plain wrong  Although blue LEDs are one heck of
a lot less efficient than red ones
2 Typical visible light LEDs dont really exist  LEDs have a fairly
narrow region of transmittence  Since the Fermi energy around either side
of the band gap falls off exponentially blah blah

You might want to check the copyright date on that 

Blue LEDs most certainly do exist Ive got a bunch at work  Cree Research
makes them probably along with other companies  Cree is big in
materials science though they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today
etc  You can buy them from JameCo I think DigiKey definitely and
plenty of other distributors

Actually these days you can get a typical visible light LED  its
called a rainbow LED and Ive forgotten who makes it they advertise in
EDN and many of the other trade rags though  It combines a reg green
and blue LED all on one chip and has four leads  Nifty device although
its probably fairly expensive
