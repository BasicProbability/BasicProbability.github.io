 Though 1500 real watts still isnt impossible  About 125150A with
 a 12V alternator less if the alternator produces higher voltages

Anyone claiming that 1500 real watts isnt possible in a mobile should
dig through their back issues of 73 and I think QST for a description
of the mobile installation of that most revered of OMs W6AM  As I recall
this included a Heath 1kW DC in amp what was that model numberSB
something  my mind is turning to the usual Friday mush and was run 
fullout CW fairly regulary  The cars electrical system had been modified 
including a rather seriouslyheavyduty alternator but such an installation 
HAS been done and so IS possible  This installation was the source of
the legendary story of W6AM sitting in the car and paging his wife over the
department store PA systems
