Subject Re Switching PS questions

 	Anyways Ive built the basic up  down converters with pretty
 	good results 80 efficiency but Im running into problems
 	when I try to design  build anything that puts out serious
 	amps I know it can be done I have some 5V200A guts on my
 	bench but something puzzles me Im using a simple choke as 
 	the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding
 	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings
 	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
 	the usual errorfeedback but some of the others seem to loose
 	me What are they for Better than that anyone have a full
 	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of Id
 	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
 	low volume 

Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage
thats handled by the big caps on the primary side those which in a 
linearlyregulated power supply would be considered the filter caps
coming right after the bridge  The transformer is just that  a 
transformer  Its there primarily to step the voltage up or down  Although
the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT
negligible as anyone whos zapped said transistor from either failing to
get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a
snubber diode across it would tell you  Actually many transistors intended
for switcher use today have the diode built in

The basic switchedmode power supply operates something like this in
a somewhat simplified manner  The AC line is rectified to produce a
high voltage moreorless unregulated DC rail  The energy storage or
filter caps appear across this rail as does the switching transistor
The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer
resulting in steppedup or steppeddown pulses out the secondary which 
are then rectified and filtered  At least one of the transformers outputs
is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor
which acts in a pulsewidth modulation PWM fashion to control by varying
the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary and
therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary  The remaining outputs
may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will moreorless
tracking the regulated output or they may have some additional linear
regulation added  You may also note that the feedback between the 
regulated output and the PWM control which is most typically an IC
is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various
safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be
electrically isolated  Often the feedback path involves an optoisolator
to meet this requirement

While the transformer isnt the primary energystorage device in these
designs this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can
be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a
bad time as noted above you also need to worry about getting all the
energy that went in to the transformer back out again one way or another
In some designs this happens more or less automatically  but in others
you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesnt
saturate which again would have disastrous results best left to the 
imagination 

Im NOT by any stretch of the imagination a powersupply designer 
hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors
in the above
