Subject  Help Need thermal specs for MC68030FE

Im doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU
I have the Motorola MC68030UMAD Rev 1 but I fear it is out of date as it
does not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi

What I need is the Theta JC Thermal Characteristic the Junction to Case
thermal resistance for the PLASTIC FE style package

If you have this info I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings
suffer a few days delay here

If you are keen on this stuff I am also interested in a more accurate value
for the typical power dissipation Im assuming 225 Watts using the 26 W
maximum at 0 C decreased the way the Pd drops in the 6801x as Ta increases
If your manual has a chart of power dissipation Id like to know what it
reads at 25 C and 40 C

Thanks for reading
