 Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a character containing
 all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt  This
 
 True enough but
 
 means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
 time slot which basically indicates a BREAK  There is no special way to
 detect BREAK that I have found other than this  theres no magic signal
 generated by UARTs etc
 
 Zilog SCC
 
 	RR07  Break Detect
 
 This is a very popular part but it has a number of quirks especially
 in HDLC mode
 
 Signetics 68562 DUSCC
 
 	RSR2  Break Start Detect
 	RSR3  Break End Detect
 
 Two of the bits in the Receiver Status Register  You can enable an interrupt
 on either of these bits going high too  Also only one NULL will be put
 in the FIFO per break detected
 
 This is simply the best serial chip Ive ever worked with  Many less
 quirks than the SCC which is IMHO secondbest  Death to 8250 devices
 

And I thought I knew a lot about serial devices  Perhaps I should just
keep my big mouth shut  Sorry
