There is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot Few drivers 
actually use this facility
there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on

I have a DeskJet 500 and I thought Id give a little info  The DeskJet 500 WILL
do landscape mode like the HP LaserJets  I cant say if other inkjets do
though  Also the DeskJet can do downloadable fonts ONLY if you buy a softfont
memory cart for it  OH  You said the LaserJet can rotate a graphic image
Hmmmmm  The DeskJet can only rotate text  Nevermind
