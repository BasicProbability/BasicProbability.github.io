Subject blinking LEDs



   Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack 


   Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate by voltage
    I guess If so what hertz pulse rate are they adjustable or set to

     Id like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx 5 hz 10 hz 
     15 hz or 20 hz Something like that Im interested in whats
     out there for flash rates I like the idea of LEDs with flasher 
     circuits already in them I hate soldering ICs in general Guess I
     dont have a hell of a lot of patience 


      Thanks
