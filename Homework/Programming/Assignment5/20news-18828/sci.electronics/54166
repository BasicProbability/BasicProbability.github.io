Can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem I am having
I have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode DTMF tones and send
the resultant in ASCII to a PC  These boards run on the serial interface
I need to run  of the boards somwehat simultaneously  I need to be able to ho
ok them up to a PC  The problem is how do I hook up 8 serial devices to one
PC inexpensivley so that all can send data simulataneously or close to it
Any help would be greatly appreciated


Are the boards at all intelligent  Ie run by microcontrollers  The
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the PC  When this line was true the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data  This isnt a perfect solution
though since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards dont
decide to talk at the exact same time

Other than that I think you will need to hook up each board to something
that speaks RS232  This actually isnt as hard or as expensive as it
used to be though  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly 9600 BPS
or slower the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data  This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system  And it assumes that each board doesnt talk more
than 18th of the time of for very long since a PIC isnt going to be
able to buffer more than maybe 20some bytes

You might want to check into the prices of multiserial card for your PC
though  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card 2 parallel ports 4
RS232 ports for a very reasonable 85
