Subject Re Selfdestructing copy protection on VHS tape

In article klp735603389quark klpdoecarletonca Ka Lun Pang writes

I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
original I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different
processes However Ive never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I dont 
want to take the chance even its small

Anyone has experience in this kind of selfdestructing video tapes


I have always thought that if I wanted to send the Police a tape with
a ransom demand on it or send CNN a video tape to see if they wanted
to buy it I would place a small magnet near the takeup spool so the
tape would be erased as it was played Who would think to check
