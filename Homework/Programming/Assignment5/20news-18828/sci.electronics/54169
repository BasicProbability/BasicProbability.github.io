Thats why you
dont find blue LEDs or for that matter some other colour of LEDs That
is not to say that blue LEDs cant be found  Ive seen blue LEDs sold
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering
They didnt emit very much light

Sorry Charlie

I have a dozen VERY blue LEDs on my bench right now They have
a clear plastic case and when lit are absolutely BLUE The hue
is sort of a summer day cloudless sky blue but make no mistake
they are blue

You can buy them from Digikey Circuit Specialist Jameco I think
LEDTronics Stanley Optoelectronics and others The current price
is around 250 each for small quantities I will also be selling
them through my mailorder company in the near future 4 weeks
Write for details if interested
