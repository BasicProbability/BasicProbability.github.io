	Hello again
 I asked this a year ago but i am still looking
 I am getting sick of having to use a HC373 

I didnt catch your posting one year ago but I presume you like to leave out
an extra alatch  I presume you allready know there is a 573 but that couldnt
be the question could it  

During my studenttrainee project I discouvered a nice device its a PSD301  
from Waferscale Integration In one single 44 PLCC I think it was package
it contained ROM RAM IO lines and a programmable addressdecoder

As far as I can recall it can be hooked directly with a MCS51 series uP  
Neat huh  But it needs programming before assembly so it wasnt suitable
for my project Perhaps usefull for you future plans 


Greetings
