Subject Re Selfdestructing copy protection on VHS tape

 Hi folks
 
 I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining sayi
 that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
 original I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two differen
 processes However Ive never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I dont 
 want to take the chance even its small
 
 Anyone has experience in this kind of selfdestructing video tapes
 
 Thanks in advance

To put it bluntly they are full of it

Paying a tape is playing a tape  There is no difference whether the 
output goes to a second VCR or to a TV  How the VCR or TV reacts to 
this signal is a different story  see messages pertaining to macrovision 
copy protection

In order for the tape to selfdestruct it would have to have circuitry 
of its own within the tape case  The circuit would have to somehow 
magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to  The 
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything

It is a pretty lame scare tactic  Ive seen something similar on a BBS
When the SYSOP wanted to he could have a message sent to the users end 
saying that it is sending the code to format your HD
