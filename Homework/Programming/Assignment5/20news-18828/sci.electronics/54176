Subject needed 120v 3watt fan

Can someone tell me where to find 120volt 3 watt 40 mA fans that
fit the standard computer mounting size ie 3 and 18 inch wide
and 4 inches diagonal from hole to hole holewhere bolt or screw
goes through  I have found higher NOISY fans that are 120 v
6 watt but I need a quite fan  I can use 12 volt as well but
found just about all 12 volt fans to be noisy  I also find that
the 120 v fans are not only quieter but the blade shape has a lot
to do with it  I have a dead fan that was quiet in its day  It
has long blades like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is
the only way I can describe it  The dead fan is ETRI Model 126LH
Actually its not dead it just makes a hideous rattle noise so
its stealthy qualities are void  Thanks
