Subject Re Pink Noise


 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies  This
is in most cases around the 2033K Hz range  PinkWhite are used to
adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that  There are a few EQs out
on the market that have Pink noise built in  Most all from Audio
Control have them I know the C101 does
