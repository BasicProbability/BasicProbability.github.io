It isnt the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather
which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer
than ground temperature battery

Uh Bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature  On the time
scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings
several feet underground there isnt going to be any major temperature
difference between the battery and what its sitting on

 Question  why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the 
surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it

Because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is
determined by the balance between internal heat production and external
heat loss  Youre feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object
your hand which is kept much warmer than its surroundings  In the case
of an object with no significant internal heat production this will
affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if
it started out not in equilibrium with them but wont affect the final
temperature

For the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not
whether water will freeze
