 I hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online  not
 because I want to copy the program but because its usually faster and
 and convenient than sifting through an old book I cant find
 
 Just MHO but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
 of them open spread across the bed next to the desk in my dorm and  
 reference them while using the program fullscreen  The Windows Help  
 things come closest to good online documentation Ive seen but they  
 generally arent detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
 space even compressed which is at a premium on my system     In  
 fact the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borlands C compiler  
 instead of using the one the lab licensed in the lab of course  Ive  
 got a SHELF full of books to help me out when Im stuck     To each  
 his own    
 
It is also much easier to scribble corrections on a hardcopy manual
