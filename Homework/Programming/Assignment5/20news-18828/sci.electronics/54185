 In other words is there some sort of neural network circuit I could build
 after a visit to a local RShack
Marvin Minsky hi there writes of building perceptrons in the 1950s using
motordriven potentiometers to vary the weights He reported that the circuits
worked even tho there were wiring errors Can you say ROBUST

Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID
somewhatlinearyetsomewhatlimiter transfer function often used 
Low power Schottky gates and earlier gates has about a gain of X8
LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells even at a
few mA And paper with dark and light regions controlled by pencil and
eraser could also control CdS resistance The very high input resistance of
CMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF papermylar caps to serve as memory
