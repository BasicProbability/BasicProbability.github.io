Subject Study as audio control engineer in the USA

Hi folks out there 

I dont know whether I am in the right newsgroup but I have a question

If I am completely wrong here in this group could you mail me the right name  
of the correct newsgroup 

A friend of mine is studying electronics at the Technical University in  
KarlsruheGermany since one year

He wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control  
engineering in the USA 

Does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the USA 
Could you send me information like emailadresses of the universities  
quality of these studies and so on 

Is it possible to email the universities directly to get information 

Do the universities send information via email 

Please could you answer via email because I dont read this newsgroup  
regularly


Thanks in advance

Stephan Jaeger
