 Hi folks
 
 I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining sayi
 that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
 original I found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two differen
 processes However Ive never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I dont 
 want to take the chance even its small

	Greetings There are 3 types of warnings on US tapes

	1 A hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the
	   tape The message usually reads If seal is broken you must
	   buy this tape

	2 The standard MacroVision warning Copies of this tape will
	   be unviewable

	3 your case Extended message for the Average Consumer tm which
	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the
	   original I dont believe you can sue them for misinformation
	   in cases like this 

	Take care

	PS Of course 3 is utter BS  but the Average Consumer tm
	     believes it Heck my mom once returned such a tape without
	     watching it she was afraid that something might just 
	     happen
