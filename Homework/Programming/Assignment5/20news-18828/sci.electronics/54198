Subject Re subliminal message flashing on TV

In article 7480237hpfcsoFCHPCOM myershpfcsoFCHPCOM Bob Myers writes
 Hi  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychology
 paper and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 TV screen at 1200ths of a second  Is that possible

 Might
even be a vector strokewriter display in which case the lower limit
on image time is anyones guess and is probably phosphorpersistence limited

Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments they used vectortype displays with 1millisecond
refresh rates common

So your case of 1200th sec is quite practical and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds not 4 or 6 either
