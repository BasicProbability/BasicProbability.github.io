Thats why you
dont find blue LEDs or for that matter some other colour of LEDs That
is not to say that blue LEDs cant be found  Ive seen blue LEDs sold
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering

No  The blue LEDs sold down the street are in milkywhite plastic  

And fyi putting a filter on a typical visible light LED presumably meaning
a nonblue one wont produce blue light  A filter can only block light it
cant generate wavelengths that arent there to start with
