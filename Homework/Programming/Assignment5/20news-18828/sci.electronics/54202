Once upon a time long long ago in this news group someone
posted a schematic for a 1bit AD converter  Well I just found a use
for the little monster  Anyone out there still got this text file
It had a flipflop a resistor and a cap and a comparatoropamp I 
think  I would be extremely thankful to anyone who could mail me the 
schematic or post it to the newsgroup

Hmmm how about a piece of copper wire  0 to 5V input range standard
TTL output instantaneous conversion time

   for the humor impaired
