 services we offered was an engine cleaning remove all that oil BEFORE you
 sell the car   Unfortunately we did not have a high pressure

 
 This definately gets the car going but WD40 is highly flammable Explosive
 even in the right conditions like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for
 eg And contact points tend to arc a tiny bit 
 
 I once saw the alternatorpoints cover blow completely off a motorcycle after
 it had been restored to life with WD40 fun to watch
 It was a Honda MR50 minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber 
 grommet so it wasnt really a big blast

 PS As a more serious aside it is apparently also conductive so it is best 
 to exercise caution with it around mains wiring
                                                 
I some years ago almost became a victim of this  Squirted a fair amount in
an old model 15 Teletype which was acting up then turned it on  The eruption
when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular I almost got
my eyebrows singed the plastic old ones had safety glass cover over the
platen etc flew across the room and several people in the room almost had
heart attacks  Beware the explosive properties of WD40 vapor
