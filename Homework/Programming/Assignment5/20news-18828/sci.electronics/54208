 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies  This
is in most cases around the 2033K Hz range  PinkWhite are used to
adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that  There are a few EQs out
on the market that have Pink noise built in  Most all from Audio
Control have them I know the C101 does  
 

With regards to what you wrote how does one adjust for room dynamics 
and stuff like that  I asked a professor that question just
last week and he didnt really know himself  Since pink noise is believed
to be due to surface states say the surface of the Silicon where theres
a lack of a covalent bond that act as traps to nearby elecrons and since
this happens at low frequencies because at high frequencies they arent
able to trap electrons how do you compensate for that  It seems to me
that you wouldnt be able to compensate for pink noise  I have seen the
pink noise feature however on many EQs and I was wondering
how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to
man made noise like power lines crosstalks coupling etc  If you have
any information about this it would be appreciated  Hope this didnt sound
too drawn out  Thanx
