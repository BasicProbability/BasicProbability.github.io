Hmmm
What is the problem with parallel port security keys I havent used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes so I dont know what the
drawbacks are I know the companies that make them claim theyre uncrackable
but Ive seen cracks of AutoDesk 3dstudio floating around I dont have one
so dont ask and I had heard that it had parralel port keys

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack 
them by reading what happens So Ive been told Ive never seen this done 
but I think its possible Youd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port
