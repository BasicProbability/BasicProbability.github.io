Subject How universal are phones these days


Im wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me
to Sweden and Germany  Its DC powered and I can buy a special adapter
for that in Europe  The question is if the general electronics work
the same  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it Im sure Id
have to but would that do the trick

Thanks
Hugo
