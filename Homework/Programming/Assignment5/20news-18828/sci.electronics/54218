Subject Re Laser vs Bubblejet

	Just thought I would add 002 to DeskJet thread I got my
first one in college about 5 or so years ago

	Ive been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for
past 5 years I got one just a few months after their release And I
got software revision 10a now Im up to rev 31 Our family sister
and father have each purchased their own DWs after seeing mine go
for one year unscathed their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter IIs
The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use I would
say that it has gone through at least 15000 sheets and around one
small ink cartridge every 3 months or so

	My brother might take this DW now Im probably gonna give it
to him and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW The chief
advantagesdisadvantages Ive found over the years are

Advantages	Quick 23 ppm Quiet roomate can sleep while its
printing AppleTalk Networkable unfortunately the original wasnt
so look out if you buy used I rewired our home with phonenet
AppleTalk connectors and while home we can all use my dads one
DW and cheap now run 300 BTW you can upgrade older DWs to
color or for appletalk I dunno if HP still does the upgrades but I
received many offers I just didnt ned it however Also crisp
laserquality output is a wonder used to really impress those
ImageWriter DotMatrix people so much so that I had to charge 025
per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all
hours of the night

Disadvantages	Ink used to be hard to find and wasnt cheap and
wasnt originally waterproof While HP has done wonders with the ink
I dunno if its still toxic it is still subjet to smearing and
running if you run around in the damp Boston rain and get your
bookbag completely soaked Ink now runs about 1415 for small carts
I get mine from ElekTek in Chicago I think theyre now down to
12 The ink carts used to say theyre dated for only 6 months but
I dont think they say so anymore We stick to a 4 month supply of
about 3 carts We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper after
fooling for a long time LaserXerox paper is also good Smearing
doesnt happen unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the
paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine
Other disadvantages are  No Postscript this can be an advantage in
speed usually Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press
software solutions I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet but
they wont release it for fear of hurting LJ sales

In the end the primary advantages of laser are true postscript
unless you go for cheap lasers and fused toner no smearing even
when soaking in water Lasers are slightly sharper but the only
instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board
Transparencies for PhotoEtching I found a Textronix color Phaser
Postscript Thermal Wax Transfer to work the best to make PCB
negatives directly onto a transparency

Well hope my babbling has helped
