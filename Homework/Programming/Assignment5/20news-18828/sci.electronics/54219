stuff about hardware keys

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key you can hack 
them by reading what happens So Ive been told Ive never seen this done 
but I think its possible Youd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port

True which is why many of the newer keys ship out oh maybe 32 bits or
so have the key encrypt them and return them to the PC  Making a bunch
of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure
things wont run without the key   Anyway then this scheme at least
defeats your approach  Its a little costly though

Personally I dont believe in copy protection and agree with the thought
that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs
the gains from what few pirates wont be able to copy the program
