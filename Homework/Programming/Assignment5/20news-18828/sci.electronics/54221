   Where can I buy blinking LEDs besides radio shack 


   Does anyone sell blinking LEDs with variable flash rate by voltage
    I guess If so what hertz pulse rate are they adjustable or set to

     Id like blinking LEDs that can be set for approx 5 hz 10 hz 
     15 hz or 20 hz Something like that Im interested in whats
     out there for flash rates I like the idea of LEDs with flasher 
     circuits already in them I hate soldering ICs in general Guess I
     dont have a hell of a lot of patience 


      Thanks

If you want slow LED flash rates adjustable by switches or by a
40664016 digitally controlled switch I suggest looking at a 555
oscillator chip They cost 1 at Radio Shack much cheaper in
quantity at quality places and you will be able to find good info
about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook I think Forest
Mims has one at Radio Shack Youll have to toy with
resistorcapacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math
to get the right frequencies Any engineer worth his salt can make a
555 osciallator Its in the book and left up to you to see I hate
doing ASCII circuit graphics The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz
to about 500 KHz I think

About the Tape Recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to
use one channel as a DATA line for flashing LED and one as audio
line for voice or music This would eliminate a lot of noise

The data line is probably most easily done
by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter using just an opamp The 565
chip is a good PLL and not hard to work with However if you nothing
about how a PLL works I suggest you dont try this OpAmp
information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack
infobooklets and the popular 741 opamp is a snap to work with
Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy so I
would suggest the 555 method firstmost I have no idea what this is
going into so I am really generalizing

As for manufacturing techniques if youre only goofing with it I
suggest you breadboard the thing No need to solder Wirewrap would
be the next more permanent step And lastly solderingPCB making
Hope that clears things
