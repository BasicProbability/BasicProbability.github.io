 	I was wondering if people had any good uses for old
 256k SIMMs  I have a bunch of them for the Apple Mac
 and I know lots of other people do to  I have tried to
 sell them but have gotten NO interest


Well  if youre willing to spend a little money  you could buy one
of those IDE caching controllers assuming you have an IDE of course
and put the 256K SIMMs on them  Hardware cache
