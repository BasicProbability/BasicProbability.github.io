    Im wondering if I can tote my American touch tone phone around with me
    to Sweden and Germany  Its DC powered and I can buy a special adapter
    for that in Europe  The question is if the general electronics work
    the same  I can buy a different wall plug and refit it Im sure Id
    have to but would that do the trick

   Two things to watch for
   In Germany and I think the same holds for Sweden only some
   of the connections can handle tone dialing so make sure the
   phone can be set to pulse dialing

Most if not virtually all swedish exchanges can handle tone
dialling Many older electromechanical exchanges have been modified
accept tone dialling
