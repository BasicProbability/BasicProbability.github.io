Subject RF Communications Link

Hi

Our problem is the following

We have to design an RF link for a distance of 250 m  Were using
standard RS232 waves square pulses as the modulating waves and the 
carrier wave is sinusoidal  The link has to be bidirectional
 
We would appreciate any advice on the type of modulating techniques
or antennas that we should use
