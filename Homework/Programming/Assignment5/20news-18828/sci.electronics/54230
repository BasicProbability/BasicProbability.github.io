 GA In order to emit blue light a semiconductor must have a band gap
 GA energy within the region of 26 to 28 electron Volts According to my
 GA physical electronics prof you cant get an LED with that band gap
 GA Thats why you dont find blue LEDs or for that matter some other
 GA colour of LEDs That is not to say that blue LEDs cant be found  Ive
 GA seen blue LEDs sold but they were just your typical visible light
 GA LED in a blue plastic covering They didnt emit very much light

    This is not true they have and do make blue LEDs they are
    about 280 in digikey 470nm wavelength by the way
