Subject Re How to drive an array of LEDs

I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed
individually by a microprocessor say 16x16 or so  Is there an LSI that
is designed to drive an LED array including RAM to hold the array state
or failing that some way of multiplexing the display so I dont have to
latch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch  I want to avoid having
a huge board covered with 373s if possible  Thanks in advance

Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want The MAX7219 drives 8
7 segment LED displays with full decode or drives 64 discrete LEDs with
a 3 wire serial interface  The chips can also be cascaded to allow very
large arrays  I am working on a sign display using this part

Ill have to post the contact info for Maxim later its at home  There was
a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of Circuit Cellar Inks
