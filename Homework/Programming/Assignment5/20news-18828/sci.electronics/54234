Comments about who needs backup copies  and YOU do deleted

Ill toss in my 2 cents worth  Ive begun to think that distribution
disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available
Weve been especially plagued by Borlands distribution disks  Im 
lucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap 
out on me  So definitely as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies
to do our installations with
