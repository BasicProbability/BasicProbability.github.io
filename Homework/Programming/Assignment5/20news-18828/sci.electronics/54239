 Listen to the interference  If you hear voices clearly it almost
 certainly ISNT ham radio and might well be CB  If you can record a
 bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operators house
 and ask him for his opinion of what youre hearing  Most communities

You cannot do that legally 

Why cant he record it legally  It may not be admissable in court but
recording for personal use is legal  If he wants to play it for his ham
friend thats legal too as long as he doesnt charge admission

Unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable  it is all poorly
designed

Here Here

 BTW hams are ALLOWED amplifiers CB isnt  illegal ham amplifier
 doesnt compute

It does but not for a mobile radio There are very few mobile rigs that
could power a 1500 watt amplifier
Bill

It doesnt actually have to be 1500 watts at 100 feet  Ive heard radio
transmissions from concert security over guitar amps with no guitar plugged
in and security uses radios transmitting 25 watts into a rubber duck antenna
which acts more like a dummy load than an antenna

Hey Bill where were you three weeks ago when all this stuff was posted
and dealt with
