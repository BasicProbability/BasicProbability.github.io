Subject HELP  Looking for Oscilloscope source

Hi all

I am looking for a new oscilloscope BK 1541B it looks like Goldstar OS904S
if I can find one cheap enough and would like suggestions on a lowpriced
source for them

Currently BTW Frys electronics in Los Angeles has the 1541B for 598
 the best price Ive seen overall for now  They carry the GS OS902S for 
 490 but I need the 904S because of the 40 MHz BW

Thanks all
