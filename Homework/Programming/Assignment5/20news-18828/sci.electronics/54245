         So whats the story here were all stuck with the regular
 green red and off yelloworange LEDs  What gives
         Anybody have a scoop on FAIRLY LOW PRICED BLUE LEDs

If your looking for LEDs in the 1020 range forget it Blue LEDs just
recently became available and the materials they are made of are expensive
Maybe in the future they will become less expensive and brighter but
for now its going to cost you and the output will be limited If they ever
do get as efficient and cost effective as red and green LEDs youre probably
going to see a whole new family of color displays
