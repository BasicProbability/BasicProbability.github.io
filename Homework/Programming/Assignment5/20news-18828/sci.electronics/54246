Can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem I am having
I have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode DTMF tones and send
the resultant in ASCII to a PC  These boards run on the serial interface
I need to run  of the boards somwehat simultaneously  I need to be able to ho
ok them up to a PC  The problem is how do I hook up 8 serial devices to one
PC inexpensivley so that all can send data simulataneously or close to it
Any help would be greatly appreciated

If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder the ideal comunications
would be over a multidrop system like RS485  RS485 boards are available
for PCs probably cheaper than a bunch of RS232 channels and RS485 is
cheaper to build onto your satellite modules using only a single supply
8pin DIP driver chip  Software at the PC end would be similarly complex
for either RS232 or RS485 in my opinion  The higher data rates possible
with RS485 would permit quasisimultaneous data transmission
Hope this helps
