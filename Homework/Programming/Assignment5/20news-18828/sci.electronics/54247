Subject Re How universal are phones these days

I dont know much about phones in Germany but this is what I know I bought
a phone in the US for my mother who lives in Bratislava Slovakia and it
works just fine The problem is they dont have wall jacks like we do here
There is a wire without any jack at the end sticking out of the wall So you
need to connect the wires Im not sure if they have wall jacks in Western
Europe  they may Hope this helps Dagmar knihacarsonuwashingtonedu
