Hi there

Does anyone know whether the PUFF RF design package is available
via ftp from any site As I understand it it is in the public
domain  please correct me if Im wrong on this one

PUFF is sold by CalTech although very inexpensively for the quality
Source was also available for the earlier releases for a nominal charge
but Im not sure if this practise is continued
