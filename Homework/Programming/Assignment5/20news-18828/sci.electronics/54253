 Nothing but if you read my WHOLE suggestion Im saying that you register
 via MAIL by mailing in your registration card THEN the company send you
 the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card

The problem with this scheme is that when I buy a game I want to play it
THAT daymailing a card to and from California would probably take a week
or more

I didnt say the program is DISABLED did I  I HATE it when people
take my words out of context  I mean that once you have installed it
you cannot DEinstall it without registering it or transfer it to another
machine or SOME SORT OF LIMITATION the author will decide WHICH WILL
BE REMOVED WHEN THE PROGRAM IS REGISTERED
