I have an IC I need help in identifying  It is an 8pin IC with the following
label  W03563  9144w4  

The 9144w4 is the date code but none of my books list a W03563
What is it out of and can you tell us what kind of circuit it is in

In the odd case that 9144w4 is not the date code NTE says a 914460
is an AM reciever subsystem and a 914461 is an FM subsystem but these
are both in 16 pin packages

More Info Please
