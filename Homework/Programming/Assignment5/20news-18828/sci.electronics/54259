Subject solvent for ducttape adhesive

I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet
Someone taped wires to the carpet and now it is time to move out

Is the solvent the same as whats used to clean up the goop in coax
whatever that is  but it just barely ties this query into 
scielectronics

Thanks for your help
Best regards
ruck
