Subject Re Removing battery corrosion

From article 1993Apr252011291239PrincetonEDU by fuchstsarprincetonedu Ira H Fuchs
 Is there a readily available solvent that does a good job at removing the  
 corrosionencrustation that collects on the battery terminals usually the  
 cathode when using alkaline batteries or more accurately when NOT using  
 them for a long time 
 generally  the corrosion is a signal that its time to send them
 of to the recyclers but if youre that desperate or cheap try 
baking soda and a wire brush use gloves and goggles please
