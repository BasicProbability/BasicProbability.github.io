Subject References for ANY IC

I am looking for a textreference that will include pinouts 
description and functionality for just about any IC made
Does such a text exist  Are there docs on the Internet that
reference ICs  It would be a great idea if each major
IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
FTP site with all its data books in the form of text files
ala RFC style  This would save time and money for the
IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
ICs
are found in the internet anyway  

Are there any books available for purchase that reference
as many as possible  Or am I going to be stuck obtaining
a zillion databooks from the manufacturers those little
phonebooktype books that are obsoleted every couple years
