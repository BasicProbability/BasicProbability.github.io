I recently took apart my color Sony TV to clean the volume pushbuttons and
when I put the beast back together the flyback whine got much louder

Is this easy to fix Which part is resonating I have heard rumors of a
spray that will fix the noise  Is this a simple thing for a TV repairman
to fix

	Thanks

Ahha  Im not alone at last  Which Sony do you have  I have a
27SXR preXBR series circa 1987  That damn thing used to
make noise like a madman  I hadhave 2 separate problemsone being the
flyback the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke
came together 

First  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly
the thing would make noise  I guess that there was enough of a potential
in that assembly to leak so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation
sprayI think it was urethane or acyrilic  That fixed it

Second  Flybackfor the life of me I cant isolate this one  If I
leave the cover off the TV will be quiet  If I put the cover back on
and let it heat up itll start to whinekinda hard to solve with the
cover on 

A friend of mine who used to fix TVs says there might be a pinhole
leak somewhere on the flyback  Usually its surrounded by a bunch of
black dustdirt

I hope this is a startif you find something out let me know
