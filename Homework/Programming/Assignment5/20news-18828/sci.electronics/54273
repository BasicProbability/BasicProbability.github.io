Subject Re References for ANY IC

 In a previous article ree88132zachfitedu Keith Ledig writes
I am looking for a textreference that will include pinouts 
description and functionality for just about any IC made
Does such a text exist  Are there docs on the Internet that
reference ICs  It would be a great idea if each major
IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
FTP site with all its data books in the form of text files
ala RFC style  This would save time and money for the
IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
ICs are found in the internet anyway  

Are there any books available for purchase that reference
as many as possible  Or am I going to be stuck obtaining
a zillion databooks from the manufacturers those little
phonebooktype books that are obsoleted every couple years

We use a CDROM based system here  There are about 45 CDROM disks and a
4disk changer hooked to a dedicated MSDOS computer  It contains scanned
images of data book pages for several thousand parts  When you ask it for
something it knows about mostly active IC parts it works quite well
THey dont handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist
It is definately a start in the right direction but they need to expand
the data base to handle more types of stuff

These systems arent cheap  We paid about 7000 for the liscence and get
monthly updates of some of the CDROM disks  We send the old ones back to
them so that they will keep sending us the updates  I think we pay a
yearly maintainence fee of about 1500 to get the updates

If you find the part you want you can look at the data sheet on a
pagesized monitor its a special monitor from SigmaSystems  You can
also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer  Page
printing takes a couple of minutes per page  It can take a while to dump
the 5 or 6 pages you usually need

I have a feeling the maker wouldnt like it if we made the data available
to all Internet users
