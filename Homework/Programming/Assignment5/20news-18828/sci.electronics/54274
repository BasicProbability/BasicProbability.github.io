Subject  Mystery Part 

    I have a mystery part labeled NEC AC100  Its from the low voltage
supply of an NEC Multisync I monitor  Its a three lead part in a
square package like a volate regulator or power transistor  The board
is labeled CR691 where the part goes  Possibly an SCR  The pin
labeled G on the board goes to a zener diode reference voltage the
pin labeled T1 goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power
supply and the pin labeled T2 goes to the negative side of the bridge
rectifier in the supply

    If anyone can tell me what this is or better yet where I can buy
one just like it please email me at ck3iandrewcmuedu  Ive called
NECs monitor repair number and not only do they not know what the
part is but they dont think that they can find one to sell to me 
It makes no sense to me

Thanks
