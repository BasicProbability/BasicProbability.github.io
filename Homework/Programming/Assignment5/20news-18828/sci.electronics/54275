Subject Re solvent for ducttape adhesive

ruckbeachcisufledu John Ruckstuhl writes

I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet

May I tease out a subthread from this discussion

Can you all please tell me how to remove  the stickers from new houses
appliances and outdoor lampposts  Especially the lamppost right on
the glass  Isnt there something you can rub into stuckon labels that
will release them from their deathgrip on glass or other hard surfaces

Many thanks for any help
