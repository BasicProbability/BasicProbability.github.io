Subject Re How universal are video phones these days

Just saw an article in New Scientist ATT videophones wont talk to BTI 
videophones The ATT ones use a 192kb modem BTI uses 144kb ATT models 
have to communicate using all ATT exchanges whereas the BTI can route 
via most current exchanges Suggestions include building standards converters 
into telephone exchanges  the mind boggles   The BTI design is a bit 
more conservative and is better able to cope with current data compression 
hardware on longdistance lines

not having the magazine to hand I may have misremembered BTI I think it
is a British one made by GECMarconi and currently selling to other
countries 

Yet Another Standards Screwup
