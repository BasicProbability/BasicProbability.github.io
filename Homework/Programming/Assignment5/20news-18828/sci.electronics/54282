Subject Prefab PC casepower supplies and CSAULFCC stuff

What kind of CSAULFCC approval do 60 mailorder PC computer
cases and power supplies have  

Can I assume that the certification process for smallscale custom hardware
ie digitalanalog circuitry is reduced or even eliminated if I use
such a case and certified power supply

Also assuming that I use a certified power supply have I satisfied the
requirements of CSAUL approval and possibly FCC approval as well
Do mailorder PC cases satisfy FCC certification  Is FCC certification
even necessary for scientific noncommercialnonresidential use
