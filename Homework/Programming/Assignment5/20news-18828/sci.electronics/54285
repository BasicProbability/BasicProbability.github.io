 What are peoples opinions about laser detectors  Escort makes a
 laser detector the Passport 1000 and claims it works fine  However
 Ive talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
 are lucky  ie if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
 front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
 detector  Otherwise it wont work  Regular radar of course travels
 in all directions hence it is more detectable  Any comments
 
 Escort has a deal till the end of April I think where if you buy
 their wideband Passport 3200  X K Ka and laser detectors youll
 save 60 off of buying them separately  In this case the addition of
 the laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only 40 ie Passport
 1000 normally costs 100

Uniden makes an all in one unit X K Ka Laser for about 130
Colorado Radar sells passive radar jammers the passive supposedly being legal
for about 100 wont help you with Laser however
