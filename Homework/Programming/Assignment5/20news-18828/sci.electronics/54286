I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet
 
 May I tease out a subthread from this discussion
 
 Can you all please tell me how to remove  the stickers from new houses
 appliances and outdoor lampposts  Especially the lamppost right on
 the glass  Isnt there something you can rub into stuckon labels that
 will release them from their deathgrip on glass or other hard surfaces
 
 Many thanks for any help
