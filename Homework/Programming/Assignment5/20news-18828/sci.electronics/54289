Subject Re solvent for ducttape adhesive

What I usually useand this stuff is only good on glassis either Acetone
or a little Benzene The latter of the two is a bit dangerous possibly a 
carcinogensp but it usualy gets the job done I imagine you can you the two
solvents on most metals as well as glass but keep the stuff away from plastic
Better yet you may just want to go to your local hardware store and ask them
what they use
