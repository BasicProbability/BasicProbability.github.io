platen etc flew across the room and several people in the room almost had
heart attacks  Beware the explosive properties of WD40 vapor



We use it as starting fluid for jet skis The fact that its a lubricant 
works very well since jet skis are 2 cycle It also helps when a ski
floods with water because we clean the spark plus with the stuff

I have an officestudio in my garage with a phone in it Our wireless phone
has a page feature where you can make the phone or hand set ring to get
the attention of the other person Is there a simple circuit that I can use
over the second pair of wires or the first pair to emulate this effect
with the phone in the garage ie push a button to make the phone ring in the
house or push a button to make it ring in the garage



Thanks
