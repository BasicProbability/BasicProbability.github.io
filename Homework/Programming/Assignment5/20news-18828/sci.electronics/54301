I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet
Someone taped wires to the carpet and now it is time to move out

 I dont know for sure that this will work but you might try MEK methyl
 ethyl keytone  It worked getting the stickum left over from shelf paper
 and is available at paint stores  Use a carbon gas mask and lots of
 ventilationthis stuff really stinks

For those who dont know methyl ethyl ketone is more commonly known 
as ACETONE and can be found as the major active ingredient in
NAIL POLISH REMOVER  YOUR WIFES PROBABLY GOT SOME HANGIN AROUND
