Subject  HELP needed with LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR Devices LDRs 

Can some kind soul provide me with information on LDRs that contain an
onboard lightsource in a totally integrated and lightshielded unit

I have seen a VTL5C LDR in some schematics  So who are the manufacturers
of these devices and what are the different types

Thanks very much in advance
Jim
