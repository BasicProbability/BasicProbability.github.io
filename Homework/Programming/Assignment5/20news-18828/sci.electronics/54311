Subject Filter Design Software for IBMPC

Has anyone got an active filter design program that runs on an IBM PC 

Something that will easily let me specify bandpass filter parameters
and it will give me the appropriate component values 

It has to be public domain  if anyone has one could you mail it to me

Thanks in advance

PS It can run under windows if necessary
