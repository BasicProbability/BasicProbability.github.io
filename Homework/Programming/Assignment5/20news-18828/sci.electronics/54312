Subject Re Why circuit boards are green

 The color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it
 
 Original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown
 Phenolic spelling was a tan
 Most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green
 Filled fiberglass is blue
 Teflon is white
 

Rubbish The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
mask that is used Older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used
a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments The light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced The blue and red
or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner Theres a lot of info
about the pros and cons of each but thats another story
