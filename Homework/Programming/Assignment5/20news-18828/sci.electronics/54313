 	Im trying to bring in 8 bits to a PC and would like
 	to use interruptdriven routines Without buying an IO
 	board or making a new port where can I bring in these
 	bits LPT seems to have only a few inputs but Ive heard
 	rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional lines Anybody
 	know fer sure If any bid LPTs which boards have them
 	Ill be running a new 386DX33

 
        Yes it is possible  Im making a 7 stepper controller board 
with 7 digital inputs and up to 18 digital outputs from the  port
   One main thing that will tell you whether the  port is 
bidirectional or not is the bus tranceiver on it  Look for a chip 
numbered 74LS245  If you dont have this then its probably a 74LS244 
which will do you NO good for reading in
  
          Now if you do have the 245 then do the following
  First find the address of the port decimal either 888 or 632
  In pascal you would WritePortxxx where xxx is the address in 
either hex or decimal  The status lines pins 14 16 17 as well as the 
strobe pin 1 are bidirectional lines and are read by base address 2 
so for 888 to read from status then read from 890  You can also output 
to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines  In pascal 
do Portxxxvalue

 
                Hope this helps
        Let me know if you need more help
