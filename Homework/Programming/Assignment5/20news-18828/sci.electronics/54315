Subject  Phosphorescent pads 

 
         A while ago I saw some translucent pads about 6x8 or so that 
could be plugged into something and they would glow  One was red 
another green another blue  Interresting  I was wondering if anyone 
would have a feed on anything of this nature and of the price
   oh the pads were rubberlike and were floppy like about 1cm thick or 
so
 
                Thanks
