  Well Bertil you might laugh but in many places here in Austria there are
no wall jacks yet either  just wires sticking out of the wall and put into
a closed often sealed box 
  As far as I remember from Germany it is a nicely mixed situation  somebody
had wires sticking somebody had jacks
  On the other hand everywhere in Bohemia I have seen wall jacks and never
seen just wires sticking out of the wall And I thought Slovakia was the
same case Well

  How much do Scandinavians know about the rest of Europe
