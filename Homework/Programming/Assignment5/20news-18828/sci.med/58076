Subject Teenage acne
From pchurchswellactrixgennz Pat Churchill


My 14yo son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose  I
bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment  I think that is probably
enough along with the usual good diet  However he is on at me to
get some product called Dalacin T which used to be a
doctorsprescription only treatment but is not available over the
chemists counter  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say
either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T or that Clearasil
is OK  I had the odd spots as a teenager nothing serious  His
father was the same so I dont figure his acne is going to escalate
into something disfiguring  But I know kids are senstitive about
their appearance  I am wary because a neighbours son had this wierd
malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from
acne treatment  I want to help  but with appropriate treatment

My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp  Sort
of teenage cradle cap  Any pointersadvice on this  We have tried a
couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to
make the condition worse not better

Shall I bury the kid till hes 21
