 Hi there
 
 	I have a very oily skin  My problem is when I wash my face it becomes
 oily in half an hour  Especially in the nose region  Is this an illness  How
 can I prevent it from occuring in such short time  Is there a cleanser out
 there that will do a better job  that is after cleaning my face wont become
 oily in such a short time
 
 	Thank you for any suggestion
 
if this is a disease everyone should have it  My skin has always been oily 
i used to say if i were hot enough you could fry an egg on my oily face
i am now 50 yrs old and my skin looks younger im told than some peoples
skin at 30 its still oily  i have only a very few tiny wrinkles  Thank
your lucky stars for that skin
