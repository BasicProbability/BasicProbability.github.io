Subject Contraceptive pill

A very simple question  it seems to me that the contraceptive
pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to
fall every month But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the 
ovule Is it true  If yes is there a risk of extrauterine
pregnancy that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian
tube
