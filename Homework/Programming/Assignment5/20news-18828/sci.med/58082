There is this newsgroup scimedphysics and there has been quite a lot
discussion in this group about many chemical items eg prolactin
cholesterol TSH etc Should there also be a newsgroup scimedchemistry

Its got potential  Instead of chemistry how about splitting the
classification into biochemistry which are probably the topics
youre thinking of and pharmaceutical which otherwise might end up
in biochemistry

This is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential
news volume to support either or both groups

Ill add em to my medicalhealth newsgroup wish list which Im looking
forward to posting and discussing  but not for another 10 days or so
