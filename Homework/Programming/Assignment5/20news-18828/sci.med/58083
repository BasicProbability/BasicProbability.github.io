Vida Can one develop innerear problems from too much flying  I hear
Vida that pilots and stewardesses have a limit as to the maximum
Vida number of flying hours  what are these limits  What are the
Vida main problems associated with too many longhaul over 4 hours
Vida trips

The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue  The cockpit
crew pilot limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew
limits for this reason  Crew rest requirements address amount of time
on duty plus rest time  A tired crew is an accidentprone crew

The only limits I know of for innerear problems are in military
aircraft which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably
pressurized  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members
DNIF duties not involving flying or grounded until the ears clear

Flying can accentuate problems if ears dont clear  If you dont have
big pressure changes you may not know that youve got a problem  But
if you zip up to 5000 or 6000 ft the usual cabin altitude in an
airliner and then back down to sea level you may discover a problem
Ears dont clear readily because of allergies colds infections and
anatomical problems  The last wont change the first three can
Medication decongestants or antihistimines usually can help
Chewing gum sucking hard candy or a bottle for babies
yawningthese will help all four causes
