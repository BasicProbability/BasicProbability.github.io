 How long does it take a smokers lungs to clear of the tar after quitting 
 Does your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it take
 a considerable amount of time for that to happen



Seems to me that I read in either a recent NY Times
Science Times or maybe it was Science News that there is
evidence that exsmokers risk of lung cancer never returns
to that of a person who has never smoked I think it may
get close  Ill find the article and post it since my
memory is hazy on the specifics  if you are interested
