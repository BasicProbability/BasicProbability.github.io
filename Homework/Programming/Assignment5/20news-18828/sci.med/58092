Ive been treated to many therapies for migraine prophylaxis and treatment
and it looks like theyll try a few more on me  I have taken propanolol
I think it was 10mg 3xdaily with no relief  I have just been started


30mg per day of propranolol is a homeopathic dose in migraine 
If you got fatigued at that level it is unlikely that you will
tolerate enough beta blocker to help you  

If we go the antidepressant route what is it likely to be  How do
antidepressants work in migraine prophylaxis


Probably a single nightime dose  We dont know how they work in migraine but
it probably has something to do with seratonin
