So Ill ask this  my neurologist just prescribed Cafergot and
Midrin as some alternatives for me to try  He stated that
the sublingual tablets of ergotamine were no longer available
Any idea why  He also suggested trying 800 mg ibuprophen


I just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too  I dont
know why  Perhaps because they werent as profitable as cafergot
Too bad since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients
and they dont do any good flushed down the toilet  I suspect
well be moving those patients more and more to the DHE nasal
spray which is far more effective
 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
