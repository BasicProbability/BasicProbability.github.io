A friend of mine was a regular volunteer blood donor  During surgery he
was given five units of blood and after a suitable recovery time he went
to donate blood at a bloodmobile He was HIV and did not know it

The Red Cross notified him with a registered letter  Thats all  No
counselling no nothing  He died two years ago this week  He left behind

How long ago was this  When I said youd get counselling I meant if
you did it now  Long ago practices varied and agencies had to gear
up to provide the counselling

a wife and a fouryearold son  Many people have suggested that his wife
should sue the Red Cross but she would not  She says that without the
blood transfusions he would have died during the surgery


Good for her  What we dont need is everyone suing community service
agencies that provide blood that people need  Testing is not fool proof
The fact that he got AIDS from a transfusion if he really did does
not mean the Red Cross screwed up  Prior to 1983 or so there wasnt
a good test and a lot of bad blood got through  This wasnt the fault
of the Red Cross  When did he get the transfusions
