and may be a total disaster and that the Canadian model is preferable a
position with which I agree  The other is surprising sympathy for the
physicians in all of this to the effect that beating up on us wont
help anything
 

Im not sure about that  Did you see the poll they took that showed
that most people thought physicians should be paid 80000 per year
tops  Thats all I make but I doubt that most physicians are going
to work very hard for that kind of bread  Many wouldnt be able
to service their med school debts on that  Mike Royko had a good
column about it

 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
