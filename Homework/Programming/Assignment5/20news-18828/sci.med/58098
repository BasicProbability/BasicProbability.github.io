IMHO you have Lyme disease  I told you this in private email and predicted
that you might next start having the migrating pains and further joint

IMHO the original poster has no business soliciting diagnoses off the net
nor does DrMr  ODonnell have any business supplying same This is one
major reason real physicians avoid this newsgroup like the plague It is
also another example of the double standard if I as a physician offered
to diagnose and treat on the net I can be sued But people without
qualifications are free to do whatever they want and disclaim it all with
Im not a doctor

Get and keep this crap off the net Period
