Re the prostate treatment is worse than the diseaseIn medicine there 
really is something histologically identified as prostate tissue and 
there are observable changes which take place that whenever they occur 
can be identified as prostate cancer What if I told you that most chiropractorstreat Subluxation Spinal Demons which dont exist at all Therefore any 
tissue damage incurred in a chiropractic treatment performed 
in an effort to exorcise this elusive Silent Killer such as ligamentous
damage and laxity microfracture of the joint surfaces rib fractures 
strokes paralysisetc is by definition worse than nontreatment

What does DC stand for  Couldnt be an antichiropractic posting
from a chiropractor could it  My curiosity is piqued

Prostate CA is an especially troublesome entity for chiropractors
It so typically causes bone pain due to spinal metastases that it
gets manipulated frequently  Manipulating a cancer riddled bone
is highly dangerous since it can then fracture  Ive seen at
least three cases where this happened with resulting neurologic
damage including paraplegia  This is one instance where knowing
how to read xrays can really help a chiropractor stay out of trouble
DO chiropractors know what bony mets from prostate look like
