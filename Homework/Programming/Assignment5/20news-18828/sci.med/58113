On the other hand we do a good job of implying that the person who
weighs 400lbs is overeating when in fact the body probably doesnt
make any moral judgements about its composition  Conceivably the 
body works just as hard maintaining its weight at 400 as someone elses
does at 200


Undoubtedly it does to maintain such a weight  And it does so
primarily by overeating  If it didnt the weight would drop
back to normal
