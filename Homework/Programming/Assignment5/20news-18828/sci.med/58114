 Explain  I thought there were 3 types of cones equivalent to RGB

Youre basically right but I think there are just 2 types  One is
sensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow 
This is why the two most common kinds of colorblindness are redgreen and
blueyellow


Yes I remember that now  Well in that case the cones are indeed
color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimed
 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
