Whats the best approach to getting off the analgesics  Is there something

Two approaches that Ive used Tofranil 50 mg qhs Naproxen 250mg bid
The Naproxen doesnt seem to be as bad as things like Tylenol in promoting
the analgesic abuse Headache  DHE IV infusions for about 3 days in
hospital  Cold turkey is the only way I think  Tapering doesnt
help I wouldnt know how you can do this without your doctor  I havent
seen anyone successfully do it alone  Doesnt mean it cant be done
