By the way does the brain even have pain receptors I thought notI heard
that brain surgery can be performed while the patient is conscious for
precisely this reason

No no we arent talking about receptors for the brains sensory 
innervation but structures such as the thalamus that handle pain
for the entire organism  Apples and oranges
