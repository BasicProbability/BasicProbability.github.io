I was wondering what steps are being taken to prevent the spread of
multidrug resistant tuberculosis  Ive heard that some places are
thinking of incarcerating those with the disease  Doesnt this violate
the civil rights of these individuals  Are there any legal precedents
for such action


Who knows in this legal climate but there is tremendous legal precendent
for forcibly quarantining TB patients in sanitariums  100 yrs ago
it was done all the time  It has been done sporadically all along
in patients who wont take their medicine  If you have TB you
may find yourself under surveilence of the Public Health Department
and you may find they have the legal power to insist you make your
clinic visits
 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
