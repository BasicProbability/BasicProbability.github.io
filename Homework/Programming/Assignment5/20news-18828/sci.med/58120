What is unacceptable about this is that hospitals and MDs by law
have no choice but to treat you if you show up sick or mangled from
an accident  If you arent rich and have no insurance who is going
to foot your bills  Do you actually intend to tell the ambulance
No let me die in the gutter because I cant afford the treatment

By law they would not be allowed to do that anyhow

gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
