I took a stress test a couple weeks back and results came back noting
Exercise Hypertension  Fool that I am I didnt ask Doc what this meant
and she didnt explain and now Im wondering  Can anyone out there
enlighten  And I promise next time Ill ask

Probably she meant that your blood pressure went up while you were on
the treadmill  This is normal  Youll have to ask her if this is
what she meant since no one else can answer for another person
