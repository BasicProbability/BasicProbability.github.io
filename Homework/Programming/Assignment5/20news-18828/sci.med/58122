I would like any information available on this rare disease  I understand
that an operation referred to as POLLIDOTOMY may be in order  Does anyone
know of a physician that performs this procedure  All responses will be
appreciated  Please respond via email to ktoddwalrusmvhsedu

It isnt that rare actually  Many cases that are called Parkinsons
Disease turn out on autopsy to be SND  It should be suspected in any
case of Parkinsonism without tremor and which does not respond to
Ldopa therapy  I dont believe pallidotomy will do much for SND
