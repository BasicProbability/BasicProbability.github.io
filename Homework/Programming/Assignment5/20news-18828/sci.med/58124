Dr Banks 
	I dont know if you make a point of keeping up with liver transplant
research but youre certainly in the right place for these questions  Has 
there been anything recent in Transplant Proceedings or somesuch on 
xenografts  How about liver section transplants from living donors 


Im sure the Pittsburgh group has published the baboon work but I
dont know where  In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants from
living donors and Im sure theyve published  I dont read the
transplant literature  I just see the liver transplant patients
when they get into neurologic trouble pretty frequent so that
and the newspapers and scuttlebutt is the way I keep up with what
they are doing  Howard Doyle works with them and can tell you more



 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
