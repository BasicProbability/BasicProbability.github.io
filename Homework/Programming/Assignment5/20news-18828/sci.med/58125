IMHO you have Lyme disease 


I sent you in private email a summary of the treatment protocols put
forth by the Lyme Disease Foundation  I respectfully suggest that you
save yourself a great deal of suffering by contacting them for a
Lymeknowledgeable physician referral and seek treatment at once
Youll know in 2 weeks if youre on the right course and the clock is
ticking on your 6 weeks if you have it 1800886LYME

If these folks are who I think they are Lymeknowledgeable may
mean a physician to whom everything that walks in the door is
lyme disease and you will be treated for lyme whether or not
you have it  Hope you have good insurance
