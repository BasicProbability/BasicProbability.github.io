I only have lunulas on my thumbs  Is there any medical 
significance to that finding  Thank you in advance for all 
replies


Try peeling the skin back at the base of your other fingernails
not too hard now dont want to hurt yourself  Youll find
nice little lunulas there if you can peel it back enough
