Also Im not sure that physician fees at the very very highest levels
dont have to come down Im not talking about the bulk of physicians
making good but not great salaries who have megaloans from medical school
debts Id also like to see some strong ethics with teeth for physicians

I agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line  The main
problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts
the system  I hope they will fix that  But Im afraid as usual
the local doc is going to take the brunt  People grouse about paying
50 to see their home doctor in his office but dont mind paying
20000 to have brain surgery  They think their local doc is cheating
them but worship the feet of the neurosurgeon who saved their life
What they dont realize is that we need more local docs and fewer
 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
