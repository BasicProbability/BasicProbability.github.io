1 How dangerous is it  From whom is it especially dangerous 

Dangerous only to immune suppressed persons and fetuses  To them
it is extremely dangerous  Most of the rest of us have already had
it and it isnt dangerous at all

2 How is it transmitted I read about raw meat and cats but Id like to
   have more details 

Cat feces are the worst  Pregnant women should never touch the litter box

3 What can be done to prevent infection 

Cook your meat  Watch it with pets

4 What are the symptoms and longterm effects 

Youll have to read up on it  

5 What treatments are availble 


There is an effective antibiotic that can keep it in check
Of course it cant reverse damage already done such as in
a fetus

gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
