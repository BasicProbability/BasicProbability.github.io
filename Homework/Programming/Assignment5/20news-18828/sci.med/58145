	First question  how bad is xray  ive heard that its nothing 
compared to the amount of time spent under the sun and ive also heard that it
is very harmful  second question  is there anyway out of this yearly test for
me

The yearly chest xray provides a minute amount of radiation  It is
a drop in the bucket as far as increased risk is concerned  Who can
tell you whether you can get out of it or not  No one here controls
that  It may well be a matter of the law in which case write your
legislator but dont hold your breath

gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
