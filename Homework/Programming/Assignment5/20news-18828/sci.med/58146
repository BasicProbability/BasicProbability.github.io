 Its not an eyepiece  It is called a head mirror  All doctors never

A speculum

The speculum is the little cone that fits on the end of the otoscope
There are also vaginal specula that females and gynecologists are
all too familiar with

In fairness we should note that if you look up speculum in the
dictionary which I did when this question first surfaced the first
definition is a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
optical instruments

Which doesnt mean the name fits in this context but its not as far
off as you might think
