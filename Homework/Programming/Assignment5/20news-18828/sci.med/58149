I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle achesback aches that
combine aspirin with a diuretic

  You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such
  The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual
  syndrome ostensibly to treat headache and bloating simultaneously
  Theyre worthless

The idea seems to be to reduce
inflammation by getting rid of fluid Does this actually work 

  Thats not the idea and no they dont work

	I believe there is a known synergism between certain
analgesics and caffiene  For treating pain not inflammation

	Now that I am an ibuprofen convert I havent taken it for some
time but excedrin really works grin
