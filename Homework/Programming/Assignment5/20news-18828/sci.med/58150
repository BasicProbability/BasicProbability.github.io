 Explain  I thought there were 3 types of cones equivalent to RGB

Youre basically right but I think there are just 2 types  One is
sensitive to red and green and the other is sensitive to blue and yellow 
This is why the two most common kinds of colorblindness are redgreen and
blueyellow


Yes I remember that now  Well in that case the cones are indeed
color sensitive contrary to what the original respondent had claimed


	Im not sure who the original respondent was but to
reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum just
as rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreen
in our case reddish in certain amphibia just as the hoseshoe crab
Limulus polyphemus photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of
the spectrum etc  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength
specificity with being color sensitive however the two are not
synonymous
	So in sum and to beat a dead horse
	1 When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
absorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelength
the cone outputs are indistinguishable
	2 Cones are simply detectors with different spectral
sensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rods
ommatidia or other photoreceptors
	3 Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which
sample different parts of the spectrum cones in this case are
processed centrally  The handwave is intentional

	Ive worked and published research on rods and cones for over
10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can detect color
is frustrating  But dont take my word for it  Im reposting a few
excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color
vision texts
