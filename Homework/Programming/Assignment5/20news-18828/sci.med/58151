there been anything recent in Transplant Proceedings or somesuch on 
xenografts  How about liver section transplants from living donors 


Im sure the Pittsburgh group has published the baboon work but I
dont know where  In Chicago they were doing lobe transplants from
living donors and Im sure theyve published  



The case report of the first xenotransplant was published in Lancet 1993 3416571
I can send you a reprint if you are interested
There was  another paper sort of a tour of the horizon written by Starzl and
published in the Residents Edition of the Annals of Surgery vol 216 October 1992
Its in the Surgical Residents Newsletter section so you wont find it in the regular
issue of the Annals I dont have any reprints of that one
A paper has been accepted for publication by Immunology Today though Im not sure
when its coming out describing our experience with the two xenografts done to date


As for segmental liver transplants from living related donors I must confess to a total
ignorance of that literature We are philosophically opposed to those and I dont keep 
up with that particular field
