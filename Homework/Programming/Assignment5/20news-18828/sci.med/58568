Using a PCs keyboard on your workstation  compatibility issues

    Mini outline
        1 Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
        2 X terminals
        3 NeXT
        4 Silicon Graphics
        5 IBM RS6000
	6 Other stuff

    1 Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port

	If youve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
	Sun HP DEC etc then youre going to have a hard time finding
	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard  If your workstation
	runs the X window system youre in luck  You can buy a cheap used
	PC hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable
	to your workstation  Then run a program on the workstation to read
	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events

	The two main programs Ive found to do this are KT and A2X

	a2x is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and
	even moving among widgets on the screen  It requires a server
	extension XTEST DECXTRAP or XTestExtension1  To find out if your
	server can do this run xdpyinfo and see if any of these strings
	appear in the extensions list  If your server doesnt have this
	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5 patchlevel 18 or later
	or bugging your vendor

	kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended X servers
	Another program called xsendevent also exists but I havent seen it

	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from sodaberkeleyedu

    2 X terminals

	Also a number of X terminals NCD Tektronics to name a few use
	PCcompatible keyboards  If you have an X terminal you may be all
	set  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the
	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard  Also some X terminals add
	extra buttons  you may need to keep your original keyboard around
	for the onceinabluemoon that you have to hit the Setup key

    3 NeXT

	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop
	Bus meaning any Mac keyboard will work  Then they announced they
	were cancelling their hardware production  If you want any kind of
	upgrade for an older NeXT do it now

    4 Silicon Graphics

	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines Indigo2 and
	beyond will use standard PCcompatible keyboards and mice  I dont
	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines  Its not
	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards except by
	upgrading the entire machine  Contact your SGI sales rep for more
	details

    5 IBM RS6000

	IBM RS6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards  
	Unfortunately you cant just plug one in  You need two things a  
	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   
	smaller PS2 style DIN6 and a new device driver for AIX  Believe 
	it or not IBM wrote this device driver recently I used it and it 
	works  However they dont want me to redistribute it  Ive been  
	told Judy Hume 512 8236337 is a potential contact  If you learn 
	anything new please send me email				    
    
    6 Other stuff

	Some vendors here notably Health Care Keyboard Co and AccuCorp
	support some odd keyboard types and may be responsive to your
	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer  If you can
	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works either
	from the vendor or with a storage oscilloscope you may be in
	luck  Contact the companies for more details


Apple Adjustable Keyboard
    Apple Computer Inc
    Sales offices all over the place

    Availability February 1993
    Price 219
    Supports Mac only

    Apple has recently announced their new splitdesign keyboard  The
    keyboard has one section for each hand and the sections rotate
    backward on a hinge  The sections do not tilt upward  The keys are
    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion

    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard
    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions

    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests which are not
    directly attachable to the keyboard

    As soon as soda comes back up Ill have a detailed blurb from
    TidBITS available there


FlexPro Keyboard
    Key Tronic
    Phone 8002626006

    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops

    Availability Spring 1993 
    Price 489 
    Supports PC only highly likely

    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex  Its
    another splitdesign  One thumbwheel controls the tilt of both
    the left and righthand sides of the main alphanumeric section
    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101key PC keyboard

    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards also so this product will
    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels

	If you want to use your Dragon product with X windows you may want
	to ask for Peter Cohen an salesman at Dragon who knows more about
	this sort of thing

    Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products
    Most if not all of them seem to run on PCs and compatibles
    including PS2s and other MicroChannel boxes  They sell you
    a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
    of popular word processors and spreadsheets

    Each user trains the system to their voice and there are provisions
    to correct the system when it makes mistakes on the fly  Multiple
    people can use it but you have to load a different personality file
    for each person  You still get the use of your normal keyboard too
    On the DragonDictate30K you need to pause 110th sec between
    words  Dragon claims typical input speeds of 3040 words per minute
    I dont have specs on the DragonWriter 1000

    The DragonDictate30K can recognize 30000 words at a time
    The DragonWriter 1000 can recognize you guessed it 1000 words at a time

    Dragons technology is also part of the following products
    about which I have no other info

	Microsoft Windows Sound System Voice Pilot
	IBM VoiceType
	Voice Navigator II by Articulate Systems  for Macintosh

    switches each forward back left right and down  The thumbs have
    a number of switches  Despite appearances the key layout resembles
    QWERTY and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to  The idea is
    that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard  The whole pod
    tilts in its base to act as a mouse

    Price 690 including one system personality module		    

    The idea is that one keyboard works with everything  You purchase
    compatibility modules a new cord and possibly new keycaps and
    then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines

    Its a threepiece folding keyboard  The layout resembles the
    standard 101key keyboard except sliced into three sections  Each
    section is on a custom telescoping universal mount  Each section
    independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
    individual to type in a natural posture  You can rearrange the three
    sections too have the keypad in the middle if you want  Each
    section is otherwise normalshaped ie you put all three sections
    flat and you have what looks like a normal 101key keyboard

    You can remap the keyboard in firmware very nice when software wont
    allow the reconfig
