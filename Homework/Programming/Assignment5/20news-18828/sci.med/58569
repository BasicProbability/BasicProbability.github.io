Changes in this version

     Added information on StressFree another typing management tool 
     for Windows


TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS these aim to help you manage your keyboard use
by warning you to take a break every so often  The better ones also include
advice on exercises posture and workstation setup  Some use sound hardware to
 
warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages

Often RSI appears only after many years of typing and the pain has
a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing
all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening
These tools act as an early warning system by listening to their
warnings and taking breaks with exercises you dont have to wait for your 
body to give you a more serious and painful warning  that is getting RSI

    Description
	Aimed at preventing RSI this program warns you to take
	breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or
	after a set number of keystrokes  whichever is earlier
	It gives you 3 exercises to do each time randomly selected from
	a set of 70  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work
	you do  data entry word processing information processing
	Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on
	how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does

	to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it  Other information
	on nonRSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer
	A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included

	CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows but does not then
	warn you when to take a break it does not therefore appear
	useful when used with Windows

	Cost 7995 quantity discounts site licenses

    Comments
	The keystrokecounting approach looks good it seems better
	to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to
	measure clock time or even typing time  The marketing stuff
	is very good and includes some summaries of research papers
	as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company 
	to pay up for RSI management tools

    Comments
	I have a copy of this and it works as advertised I would say
	it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management because it
	does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes  Also it
	interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which
	is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day  Worked OK on
	Windows 30 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE  not sure
	why Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC and has
	one window without window controls  Very usable though and does not
	require any sound hardware

    Comments
	I have had a play with this and it works OK  Its user interface
	design is much better in 20 though still a bit unusual
	expensive tool around and it does the job  It is also the only
	tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it
	on your local bulletin boards FTP servers and Bitnet servers
	Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics but it does 
	have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence
	which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises

    Tool Typewatch freeware version 38 October 1992
    Available from
	Email to richarddhoskynscouk
	Anonymous ftp sodaberkeleyedupubtypinginjurytypewatchshar
    Platforms UNIX tested on SCO SunOS Mach character and X Window mode
    Description
	This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you
	to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously
	typing  It does not provide exercises but it does check
	that you really do take a break and tells you when you
	can start typing again  

	Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing
	today each time it warns you which is useful so you
	know how much you really type  It also logs information
	to a file that you can analyse or simply print out  

	The warning message appears on your screen in character mode
	in a popup window for X Windows or as a Zephyr message
	for those with Athena stuff   Tim Freeman tsfcscmuedu 
	has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for 
	X Zephyr and Mach

	Not formally supported but email richarddhoskynscouk
	for SCO SunOS character mode or tsfcscmuedu for Mach
	X Window mode Zephyr if you have problems or want to give 
	feedback

    Tool Various calendar  batch queue programs
    Available from
	Various sources
    Platforms Various
    Description
	Any calendarreminder program that warns you of an upcoming
	appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool
	Or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit
	a program to run at a specific time to display a message to
	the screen

	Using Windows as an example create a Calendar file and
	include this filename in your WININIs load line so
	you get it on every startup of Windows  Suppose you
	want to have breaks every 30 minutes starting from 9 am
	Press F7 Special Time to enter an appointment enter
	930 hit Enter and type some text in saying what the break
	is for  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat 
	for the next appointment

	By using Windows Recorder you can record the keystrokes
	that set up breaks throughout a day in a REC file  Put this
	file on your run line as above and you will then with
	a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments
	with RSI exercises

	The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs 
	An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job
	that runs at 930 am and warns you to take a break this will
	depend a lot on your operating system

	While these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing 
	yourself to take a break if you cant get hold of a suitable RSI 
	management tool  If you are techie enough you might want to
	write a version of Typewatch see above for your operating
	system using batch jobs or whatever fits best

    Tool Digital watches with countdown timers
    Available from
	Various sources eg Casio BP100
    Description
	Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable
	number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either
	manually or automatically  

	While these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you
	are writing reading driving or doing anything away from
	a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI  The great
	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you
	are doing
	
    Comments
	My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to
	my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which
	actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left
	arm improved  Getting a countdown timer watch has been
	very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day

	I have tried an old fashioned hourglass type egg timer but
	these are not much good because they do not give an audible
	warning of the end of the time period


KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS these enable you to change your keyboard mapping
so you can type onehandedly or with a different twohanded layout  
Onehanded typing tools may help but be VERY careful about how 
you use them  if you keep the same overall typing workload you
are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing
and may therefore make matters worse

    Tool hsh public domain
    Available from
	Anonymous ftp sodaberkeleyedupubtypinginjuryhshshar
    Platforms UNIX dont know which ones
    Description
	Allows onehanded typing and other general keyboard remappings
	Only works through ttys so you can use it with a terminal or
	an xterm but not most X programs

    Tool Dvorak keyboard tools various
    Available from
	Anonymous ftp sodaberkeleyedupubtypinginjuryxdvorakc
	Also built into Windows 3x 
    Description
	The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout
	that involves more balanced hand use   It may help prevent
	RSI a bit but you can also use it if you have RSI since 
	it will slow down your typing a lot
