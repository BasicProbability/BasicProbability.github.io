3 General info on injuries

First and foremost of importance if you experience pain at all then
you absolutely need to go see a doctor  As soon as you possibly can  The
difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery
and a long drawnout ordeal  GO SEE A DOCTOR  Now your gardenvariety
doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury  Generally
any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in
these kinds of problems  DONT WAIT THOUGH  GO SEE A DOCTOR

The remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from
a wonderful report by New Zealands Department of Labour Occupational
Safety and Health Service Occupational Overuse Syndrome Treatment and
Rehabilitation A Practitioners Guide

First a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldnt have your hands
note youre likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors 

  RSI Repetitive Strain Injury  a general term for many kinds of injuries
  OOS Occupational Overuse Syndrome  synonym for RSI
  CTD Cumulative Trauma Disorder  another synonym for RSI
  WRULD WorkRelated Upper Limb Disorders  yet another synonym for RSI
  CTS Carpal Tunnel Syndrome see below
  Hyperextension  Marked bending at a joint
  Pronation Turning the palm down
  Wrist extension Bending the wrist up
  Supination Turning the palm up
  Wrist flexion Bending the wrist down
  Pinch grip The grip used for a pencil
  Ulnar deviation Bending the wrist towards the little finger
  Power grip The grip used for a hammer
  Radial Deviation Bending the wrist toward the thumb
  Abduction Moving away from the body
  Overspanning Opening the fingers out wide

Now then problems come in two main types Local conditions and diffuse
conditions  Local problems are what youd expect specific muscles
tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt
Diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle
discomfort pain burning andor tingling with identifiable areas of
tenderness in muscles although theyre not necessarily the problem

 Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur  Heres the theory

Normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which
pass among the muscle fibers  When you tense a muscle you restrict
the blood flow  By the time youre exerting 50 of your full power
youre completely restricting your blood flow

Without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out
then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates
nasty byproducts like lactic acid which cause pain

Once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the
load  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes
things worse with repetitive motion  More tension means less blood flow
and the cycle continues

Another byproduct of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from
your nerves  They need blood too

Anyway when youre typing too much youre never really giving a change
for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never
relax enough to let the blood through  Stress poor posture and poor
ergonomics only make things worse

 Specific injuries you may have heard of

note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic  Acute
injuries are severely painful and noticable  Chronic conditions have
less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real

Tenosynovitis  an inflamation of the tendon sheath  Chronic tenosynovitis
occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to
cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths ability
to lubricate the tendon  As a result the tendon sheath thickens gets
inflamed and youve got your problem

Tendonitis  an inflammation of a tendon  Repeated tensing of a tendon
can cause inflamation  Eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating
and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more
swelling and more pain  Subacute tendonitis is more common which entails
a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse
with repetitive activity

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome  the nerves that run through your wrist into your
fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them  Symptoms include
feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation
CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition

Adverse Mechanical Tension  also known as neural tension this is where
the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly
compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere
AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS 
disorders  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy 
brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy

Others for just about every part of your body theres a fancy name for
a way to injure it  By now you should be getting an idea of how OOS
conditions occur and why  Just be careful many inexperienced doctors
misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when in reality you
may have a completely different problem  Always get a second opinion
before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery

4 Typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment

The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce
tension in the muscles and tendons  This requires learning how to relax
If youre under a load of stress this is doubly important  Tune out
the world and breath deep and regular  Relaxing should become a guiding
principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break
EVERY THREE MINUTES TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK  Really do it every
three minutes  Its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings
calm down and relax

If you cant sleep you really need to focus on this  Rest sleep and
relaxation are really a big deal

There are all kinds of other treatments of course  Drugs can reduce
inflamation and pain  Custommolded splints can forcefully prevent bad
posture  Surgery can fix some problems  Exercise can help strengthen
your muscles  Regular stretching can help prevent injury  Good posture
and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension  Ice or hotcold
contrast baths also reduce swelling  Only your doctor can say whats best
for you

 Posture  here are some basic guidelines  I so liked the way this was
written in the New Zealand book that Im lifting it almost verbatim from
Appendix 10  dwallach

 Let your shoulders relax
 Let your elbows swing free
 Keep your wrists straight
 Pull your chin in to look down  dont flop your head forward
 Keep the hollow in the base of your spine
 Try leaning back in the chair
 Dont slouch or slump forward
 Alter your posture from time to time
 Every 20 minutes get up and bend your spine backward

Set the seat height first  Your feet should be flat on the floor  There 
should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees
and your thighs should not slope too much

Now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable
to work at  If you are short this may be impossible  The beest remedy
is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a
footrest

Now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space
between the backrest and the seat pan  The backrest should support you in
the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this
area

If you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning
back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available

Now I diverge a little from the text

A good chair makes a big difference  If you dont like your chair go
find a better one  You really want adjustments for height back angle
back height and maybe even seat tilt  Most arm rests seem to get in
the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm
rests which you can also rotate out of the way  You should find a good
store and play with all these chairs  pick one thats right for you
In the San Francisco Bay Area I highly recommend Just Chairs  The
name says it all

 Keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements

There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right  For some
people wrist pads seem to work wonders  However with good posture you
shouldnt be resting your wrists on anything  you would prefer your
keyboard to be right there  If you drop your arms at your side and then
lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands
when your elbows are at about 90 degrees  Of course you want to avoid
pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs  Wrist pads
may or may not help at this  You should get somebody else to come and
look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax  Its
often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or
deviated hands

Some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly
designed  A number of replacements are available on the market today

5 Requests for more info

Clearly the above information is incomplete  The typinginjury archive
is incomplete  Theres always more information out there  If youd like
to submit something please send me mail and Ill gladly throw it in

If youd like to maintain a list of products or vendors that would be
wonderful  Id love somebody to make a list of chairdesk vendors  Id
love somebody to make a list of doctors  Id love somebody to edit the
above sections looking for places where Ive obviously goofed
