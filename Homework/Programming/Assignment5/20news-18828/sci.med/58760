Subject Re MORBUS MENIERE  is there a real remedy

In article 19607pittUUCP gebcspittedu Gordon Banks writes
A recent movie Lorenzos Oil offers a perfect example of what
Im talking about  If you havent seen it you should  Its not

I saw it  It is almost a unique case in history  First ALD
is a rare but fatal disease  
Their accomplishment was significant  Of course it was overplayed
in the movie for dramatic effect  The oil is not curative and doesnt even
prevent progression only slows it 

Theres a pretty good article in the the March 6 1993 New Scientist titled
Pouring cold water on Lorenzos oil  The article states that research
has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
disease in patients in which demyelination has begun  In patients with
AMN a less acute form of the same disease there is some improvement
seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses  In ALD patients
who have not yet begun demyelination the jury is still out
