What about Kekules infamous derivation of the idea of benzene rings
from a daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails  Is this
specific enough to count  Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic
phil of sci texts as an example of the inventive component of
hypothesizing 

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root
Bernstein  See his book Discovering  Ring structures for benzene
had been proposed before Kekule after him and at the same time as him
The current models do not resemble Kekules  Many of the predecessors
of Kekules structure resemble the modern model more

I dont think extrascientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion
of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens  Extrarational
is a better phrase  In fact there are quite a number of wellknown cases
of extrarational considerations driving science in a useful direction

For example Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
enantiomers the origin of stereochemistry partly because he liked a
friends crank theory of chemical action  The friend was wrong but
Pasteurs discovery stood  A prior investigator Mitscherlich looking
at the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail presumably because he
lacked Pasteurs motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
acid from tartaric now we say dtartaric acid

Again Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
tartaric acid again not because of some rational conviction but because
he was trying to produce yeast that lived on ltartaric acid  His notebooks
contained fantasies of becoming the Newton of mirrorimage life which
he never admitted publically

Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes  Avery
started this work because of one of his students and ardent Anglophile
and Francophobe Canadian defended Fred Griffiths discoveries in mice
Most of Griffiths critics were French which decided the issue for the
student  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths work in vitro which the
student eventually did whereupon Avery was convinced and started the
research program which in 15 or so years produced the famous discovery
