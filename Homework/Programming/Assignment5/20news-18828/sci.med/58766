   WASHINGTON April 14   Internal EPA data released
today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about
100 large water systems  serving cities from Boston to San
Francisco  do not filter to remove diseasecarrying organisms
leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease
outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee
   The EPA list is attached
   These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water
supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate
pollution controls or filtration said Erik Olson a senior
attorney with NRDC  Water contamination isnt just a problem in
Bangladesh its also a problem in Bozeman and Boston
   As of June 29 1993 about 100 large surface water systems on
EPAs list probably will be breaking the law  The 1986 Safe
Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either
filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use
from pollution Olson continued  Some systems are moving
towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are
expected to miss the laws deadline
   Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already
a reality in other cities  A 1991 survey of 66 US surface
water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent
of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism
cryptosporidium and 81 percent contained a similar parasite
called giardia
   Adding to the level of concern a General Accounting Office
study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee
Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the
nations system for conducting and following through on sanitary
surveys of water systems
   This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions
of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be
assured that their water is safe to drink  We must immediately
put into place programs to protect water sources from
contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment
must be installed to protect the public Olson noted  The time
has come for many of the nations water utilities to stop
dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from
contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs
needed to assure their water is safe to drink
