Subject Exercise and Migraine

We were talking about Migraine and Exercise Im the one who cant
fathom the thought of exercise during migraine  Anyway turning
the thread around the other day I played tennis during my lunch
hour  Im out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise  I
got overheated and dehydrated  Afterwards I noticed a tingling
sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later I could feel
a migraine start  I continued to drink water in the afternoon
I took cafergot but it didnt help and the pain started although
it wasnt as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night the
pain subsided

This isnt the first time that Ive had a migraine occur after exercise
Im wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder
what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration
Im not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do besides get into 
shape and dont play at high noon to prevent this

Thanks
