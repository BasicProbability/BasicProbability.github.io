     If the nose culture shows Staph then Ceftin or even Ceclor
     are better Suprax does not kill Staph Treating bacterial
     infections involves a lot of tryandfail because the
     infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant
     strains Some 60 of Hemophilus Influenza strains are now
     resistant What works for me and my organisms may not work
     for you and yours Keep experimenting
