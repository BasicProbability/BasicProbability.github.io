Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

 Now if instead of using the MSG as a food additive you put the MSG 
 in gelatin capsules or whatever there may not
 be a reaction becasue the sensoryresponse might be
 a necessary element in the creation of the MSG reaction  Ill bet 
 the bogus medical researchers never even thought about 
 that obvious fact

 Gee  He means placebo effect  Sorry but the researchers DO know about
 this

Carl it is not placebo effect if as hypothesised the 
sensory response to MSGs effect on flavor is responsible
for the MSG reaction
