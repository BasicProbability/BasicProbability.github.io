From gebcspittedu Gordon Banks
Subject Re Eugenics

Probably within 50 years a new type of eugenics will be possible
Maybe even sooner  We are now mapping the human genome  We will
then start to work on manipulation of that genome  Using genetic
engineering we will be able to insert whatever genes we want
No breeding no hybrids etc  The ethical question is should
we do this  Should we make a race of diseasefree longlived
Arnold Schwartzeneggermuscled supermen  Even if we can



 

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
