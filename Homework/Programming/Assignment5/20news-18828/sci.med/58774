Subject Re Homeopathy a respectable medical tradition

In article 19609pittUUCP gebcspittedu Gordon Banks writes

Accepted by whom  Not by scientists  There are people
in every country who waste time and money on quackery
In Britain and Scandanavia where I have worked it was not paid for
What are most of these countries  I dont believe you

I am told by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried
is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without
really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted
in the first place about homeopathy that in Britain homeopathy is
available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000
GPs who use homeopathic practices True False What

Have there been any important and documented investigations into
homeopathic principles

I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend I turned to the
section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine and two
paragraphs informed me that homeopaths dont feel obliged to provide
any sort of explanation The author stated this with pride as though
it were some sort of virtue Why am I sceptical about homeopathy Is
it because I am a narrowminded bigot or is it because homeopathy
really looks more like witchdoctory than anything else
