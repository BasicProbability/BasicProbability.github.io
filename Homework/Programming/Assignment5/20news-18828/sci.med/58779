Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy  tradition

 I dont think extrascientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion
 of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens  Extrarational
 is a better phrase  In fact there are quite a number of wellknown cases
 of extrarational considerations driving science in a useful direction

Yeah but the problem with holding up the extrarational examples as
exemplars or as refutations of well founded methodology is that you
run smack up against such unuseful directions as Lysenko  Such extra
rational cases are curiosities  not guides to methodology
