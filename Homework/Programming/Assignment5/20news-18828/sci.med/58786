This isnt the first time that Ive had a migraine occur after exercise
Im wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder
what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration
Im not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do besides get into 
shape and dont play at high noon to prevent this

Ive gotten migraines after exercise though for me it seems to be related
to exercising without having eaten recently
