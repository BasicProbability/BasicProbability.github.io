 Dear all
 
 I am a Crohns Disease sufferer and Im interested if anyone knows of any current research that is going on into the subject Ive done some investigation myself so you dont need to spare me any details Ive had the fistulas the ileostomy etc
 
 Is a cure on the horizon 
 
 I am not in the medical profession so if you do reply I would appreciate plain speak
 
 Id prefer to be mailed direct as I dont always get a chance to read the news
 
 Thank you in advance
 
 Dave
