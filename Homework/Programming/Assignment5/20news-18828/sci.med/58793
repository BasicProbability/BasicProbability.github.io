Subject Re Exercise and Migraine

In article 1993Apr1516313325634ntmtv janetntmtvcom Janet Jakstys writes
                the other day I played tennis during my lunch
hour  Im out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise  I
got overheated and dehydrated  Afterwards I noticed a tingling
sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later I could feel
a migraine start  I continued to drink water in the afternoon
I took cafergot but it didnt help and the pain started although
it wasnt as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night the
pain subsided

This isnt the first time that Ive had a migraine occur after exercise
Im wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and I wonder
what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration
Im not giving up tennis so is there anything I can do besides get into 
shape and dont play at high noon to prevent this

Hi Janet

Sounds exactly like mine  Same circumstance same onset symptoms 
same cafergot uselessness same duration  In fact of all the people
I know who have migraines none have been so similar  There is such
a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their
headaches that I generally dont bother sharing what Ive learned
about mine but since ours seem to be alike here are my observations

I dont think its heat per se Ive had more in winter than summer
Dehydration could conceivably figure though  Try tanking up before
playing rather than after

Being in shape doesnt seem to help me much either

Ive identified four factors that do make a difference listed in 
descending order of importance

1 Heavy exercise
2 Sleep deprivation
3 Fasting		eg skipped breakfast
4 Physical trauma	eg head bonk

Heavy exercise has preceded all of my postadolescent migraines but I 
dont get migraines after every heavy exercise session  One or more of 
the other factors must be present usually 2  Since I discovered 
this Ive been nearly migrainefree  relapsing only once every two 
or three years when I get cocky Its been so long maybe I just dont 
get them anymore and stop being careful

Hope this is helpful

John
