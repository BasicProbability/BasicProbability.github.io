a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity  I think all
of us cycle  Ones success depends on how large the fluctuations
in the cycle are  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds  Unfortunately
Im not one of them


This certainly describes my situation perfectly For me there is
a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears to
be totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to not
put on too much weight When I get too fat I just dietexercise
more with varying degrees of success to take off the
extra weight Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range but
smaller and larger cycles occur as well Im always afraid
that this method will stop working someday but usually
I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check
This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion
of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
that results in longterm weight gain I have been cycle
dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change

As mentioned in Adiposity 101 only some experience weight
rebound  The fact that you dont doesnt prove it doesnt
happen to others
