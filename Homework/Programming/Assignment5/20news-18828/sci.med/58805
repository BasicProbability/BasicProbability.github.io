Subject cystic breast disease

My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease  a big
relief as it was a lump that could have been cancer  Her doctor says
she should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months as well as
stopping the estrogen shes been taking for menopauserelated reasons
Shes not thrilled with this I think especially because she just gave
up cigarettes  soon she wont have any pleasures left  Now I thought
Id heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk
Is this accurate  If so why is she being told to make various
sacrifices to treat something thats not that big of a deal

Thanks for any information

 Chris
