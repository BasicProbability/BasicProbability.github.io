If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with
an obviously benign headache syndrome Id like to hear what your magic
is
 
I certainly cant always avoid it unless I want to be rude I suppose
 
I made a decision a while back that I will not be bullied into getting
studies like a CT or MRI when I dont think they are indicated  If the
patient wont accept my explanation of why I think the study would be a
waste of time and money I suggest a second opinion
