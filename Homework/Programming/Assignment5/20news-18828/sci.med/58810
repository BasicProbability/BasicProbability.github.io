Surprise surprise different people react differently to different things One
slightly off the subject case in point My brother got stung by a bee I know
he is allergic to bee stings but that his reaction is severe localized
swelling not anaphylactic shock I could not convince the doctors of that
however because thats not written in their little rule book

Of course bee venom isnt a single chemical  Could be your brother is
reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock
in other people

Similarly Chinese food isnt just MSG  There are a lot of other ingredients
in it  Why when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they dont
normally consume one of which happens to be MSG do they immediately conclude
that any negative reaction is to the MSG

I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad
reactions to MSG including headaches stomachaches and even vomiting

Id be surprised if some of these reactions werent due to other ingredients

understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
