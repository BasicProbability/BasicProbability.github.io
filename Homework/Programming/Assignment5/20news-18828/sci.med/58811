Heres a potentially stupid question to possibly the wrong news group but 

Can men get yeast infections Spread them What kind of symptoms
Similar as womens  I have a yeast infection and my husband who is a
natural paranoid on a good day is sure hes gonna catch it and keeps
asking me what its like  Im not sure what his symptoms would be  

The answer is yes and no  Im sure others on scimed can expand on this

Recently someone posted an account of this
Unfortunately it was posted to alttasteless so the gross details were emphasized
instead of th e actual scientific facts
