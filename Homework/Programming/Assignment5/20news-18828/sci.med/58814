Subject left side pains

Hello to everybody
I write here because I am kind of desperate For about six weeks Ive been
suffering on pains in my left head side the left leg and sometimes the left 
arm I made many tests eg computer tomography negative lyme borreliosis
negative all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range theyre
all oK so I should be healthy As a matter of fact I am not feeling so
I was also at a Neurologists too he considered me healthy too

The blood tests have shown that I have little too much of Hemoglobin 175
common range is 14 to 17 I unfortunately do not know about the units
Could these hemisided pains be the result of this or of a also possible
block of the neck muscles 

I have no fever and I am not feeling entirely sick but neither entirely 
healthy 

Please answer by direct email on ghilardiurzunibasch

Thanks for every hint

Nico
