This was known long ago  Brain produces and uses some MSG naturally
but not in doses it is served at some chinese places 
Having said that i might add that in MHO MSG does not enhance
flavor enoughf for me to miss it  When I go to chinese places
I order food without MSG  Goos places will do it for you
 

	I just wanted to point out that some of the food particularly
	the soups are prepared in a big batch so the restaurant
	wont be able to take the MSG out of it  Sometimes its
	pretty hard to find out if this is the case or not
