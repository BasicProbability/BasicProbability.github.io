Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is
dangerous ie indicates a possible pancreatic problem  One Dr says no the
other not his specialty says the first is negligent and that another blood
test should be done  Also what is a good diet what has worked for a hypo
glycemic  TIA
