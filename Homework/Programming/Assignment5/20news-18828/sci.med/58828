 Now here is a new one vomiting My guess is that MSG becomes the number one
 suspect of any problem In this case it might be just food poisoning But
 if you heard things about MSG you may think it must be it



Yeah it might if you only read the part you quoted  You somehow left 
out the part about we all ate the same thing  Changes things a bit eh

You complain that people blame MSG automatically since its an unknown and
therefore must be the cause  It is equally if not more unreasonable to
defend it automatically assuming that it CANT be the culprit

Pepper makes me sneeze  If it doesnt affect you the same way fine
Just dont tell me Im wrong for saying so

These people arent condemning Chinese food Mr Chen  just one of its 
optional ingredients  Try not to take it so personally
