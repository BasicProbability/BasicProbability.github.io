Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy  tradition

In article C5JDuoK13unxsascom sasghmtheseusunxsascom Gary Merrill writes
Of course we cant hope currently at least to explain how or why
Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails
Surely it wasnt the only daydream he had  What was special about
this one  Could it have had something to do with a perceived
analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
geometry of molecules  Is such analogical reasoning extrascientific
Or is it rather at the very heart of science Perices notion of abduction
the use of models within and across disciplines  Upon close examination
is there a nonrational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps
closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model

I feel the need to repeat myself Kekules dream is a rather bad example
of much of anything  Read RootBernsteins book on the history of the
benzene ring
