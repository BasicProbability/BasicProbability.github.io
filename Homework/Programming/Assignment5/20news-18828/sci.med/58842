Subject Postfever rashes  I get em every time

The subjectline says it  every time I run a fever I get an amazing
rosy rash over my torso and arms  Fortunately it doesnt itch

The rash  always comes on the day after the
fever breaks and no matter what the illness was  cold flu whatever
It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current
town although I dont know if that has anything to do with anything

Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever
a severe or longlasting fever brings a longlasting rash  A mild fever
seems to bring rashes that go away faster  

Anybody know what might be causing this  Its no more than an 
embarassment but Id be curious to know whats going on  Am I carrying
some kind of feverresistant bug that goes wild when fever knocks out
its competition
