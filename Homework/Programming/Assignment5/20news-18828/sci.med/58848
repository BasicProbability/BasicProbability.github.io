Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

In article 1qhu7sd3uagateberkeleyedu sppzabriskieberkeleyedu Steve Pope writes

   Its worse than that  there is no such thing as
   a doubleblind study on the effects of MSG by
   virtue of the fact that MSG changes the taste of food in
   a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and
   that cannot be duplicated by a placebo

Common You can easily disguise  to flavor of  MSG by putting  it in a
capsule Then  the  study  becomes  a  double  blind of  MSG capsules
against control  capsules containing exactly  the same contents minus
the MSG
