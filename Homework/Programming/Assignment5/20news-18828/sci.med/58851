   You can also swab the inside of your nose with Bacitracin using a
   Q tip Bacitracin is an antibiotic that can be bought OTC as an
   ointment in a tube The doctor I listen to on the radio says to apply
   it for 30 days while you are taking other antibiotics by mouth

   I have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called 
   Septra DS  He said it may cause GI problems and I have a sensitive stomach 
   to begin with  Anybody ever taken this antibiotic  Any good  Suggestions 
   for avoiding an upset stomach  Other tips

Ive taken Septra  My daughter has taken it many times for ear
infections  It works sometimes  It is a sulfa drug  About the only
problem I found was that Im sensitive and developed a rash after nine
days of a ten day course  No more Septra for me  My doctor was
remiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash  I was quite in the
dark and didnt realize that it could be a drug reaction  No harm
done though
