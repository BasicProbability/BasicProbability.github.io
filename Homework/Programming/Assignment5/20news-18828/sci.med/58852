Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
I saw in the NY Times Sunday that scientists have testified before 
an FDA advisory panel that complaints about MSG sensitivity are
superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary 

Im old enough to remember that the issue has come up at least
a couple of times since the 1960s Then it was called the
Chinese restaurant syndrome because Chinese cuisine has
always used it


	My blood pressure soars my heart pounds and I cant get to sleep
for the life of me feels about like I just drank 8 cups of coffee

	I avoid it and beet sugar flavor enhancers beet powder and
whatever other names it may go under Basicaly I read the ingredients and
if I dont know what they all are I dont buy the product

	MSG sensitivity is definately real
