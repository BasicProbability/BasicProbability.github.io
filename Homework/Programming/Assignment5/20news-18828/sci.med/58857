 genes  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
 binding assays  The result was a wellconserved 400 or so bp sequence

But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy

The fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to
one of the hot questions of the day 77  He really had very little
reason to believe it other than raw hope  By fantasy I certainly dont
mean Velikovskian manias

some other theory or domain  I would offer some rather well known examples
such as Toricellis Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his
sea of air hypothesis

Im not familiar with the history of this experiment although arguably
I should be

surprising
Well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly
be counted as so  Was the theory constructed and the experiment designed
out of perfectly rational grounds  Well there was a pretty successful and
well know theory of fluids  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit
The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a novelty
at the time  Was the theory interesting  Yes  Was it new  Well one
could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new
domain but I think this begs certain questions  We can debate that if you
like

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising
Thats not what Id quibble about  What Id like to know are Toricellis
reasons for doing his experiment not the post hoc constructed reasons
but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem  It may be
impossible to know much about Toricellis thoughts thats too bad if
it is so  One of RootBernsteins services to science is that he has gone
rooting about in Pasteurs and Flemings and other peoples notes and has
discovered some surprising clues about their motivations  Pasteur never
publicly admitted his plan to create mirrorimage life but the dreams are
right there in his notebooks finally public after many years ready for
anyone to read  And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous
reasons for pursuing results one of my best came because I was mad at
a colleague for a poorlywritten claim I disproved the claim

Of course Toricellis case may be an example of a rarety where the
fantasy not only motivates the experiment but turns out to be right
in the end
