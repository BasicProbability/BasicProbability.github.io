Subject Re Eugenics

In article 19617pittUUCP gebcspittedu Gordon Banks writes
Probably within 50 years a new type of eugenics will be possible
should we do this  Should we make a race of diseasefree longlived
Arnold Schwartzeneggermuscled supermen  Even if we can

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and
gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon 


	Two thoughts

	 I think that psychologically it will be easier for the next 
generation to accept genetic manipulation  It seems that people frown
upon messing with Nature ignoring our eonsold practice of doing just that
Any new human intervention is arrogance and hubris and manipulation
we routinely do is natural and certainly not a big deal

	 Most interesting human traits will probably be massively
polygenetic and be full of tradeoffs  In addition without a positive
social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts having them wont
be the advantage its made out to be  Some people will certainly pursue it
as if it is the Grail but we know how most of those quests turn out
