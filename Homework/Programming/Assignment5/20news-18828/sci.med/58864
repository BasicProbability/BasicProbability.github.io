Subject Panic Disorder  more success stories

I posted this to scipsychology on April 3 and after seeing
your post here on panice disorder thought it would be
relevant



My research indicates that two schools of thought exist
the literature promoting medication says its the superior
treatment  Not surprisingly literature promoting cognitive
therapy also claims to be superior

What are the facts  Early in my research I didnt have a
bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy  I
was interested in a treatment that worked  After reading
journals published after 1986 the cognitive therapy camp
claims a higher success rate approx 80 a lower dropout
rate and no side effects associated with medication

LarsGoran Ost published an excellent article titled
Applied Relaxation Description of a coping technique and
a review of controlled studies  This is from Behav Res Ther
vol 25 no 5 pp 397409 1987  The article provides
instructions on how to perform applied relaxation AR
Briefly you start with two 15 minute sessions daily and
progress in 812 weeks to performing 1015 thirty second sessions
daily

Ill snail mail this article to anyone interested USA only please
International please pay for postage
