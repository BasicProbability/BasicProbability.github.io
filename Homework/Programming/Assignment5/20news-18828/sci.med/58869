SP From paulsontab00larcnasagov Sharon Paulson
SP to describe here  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced
SP a seizure on November 3 1992 at 645AM after eating Kellogs Frosted
SP Flakes

SP Well we were going along fine and the other morning April 5 she had
SP a bowl of another Kellogs frosted kind of cereal Fruit Loops I am

SP When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for
SP the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea  Now
SP after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even
SP he is scratching his head

Theres no data that sugarcoated cereals cause seizures  I havent
even seen anything anecdotal on it  Given how common they are eaten
 do you know any child or adolescent who doesnt eat the stuff 
I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now
Also theres nothing weird in those cereals  As far as the brain
is concerned except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as
galactosemia sugar is sugar regardless if it is coated on cereal
sprinkled onto cereal or dissolved in soda coffee or whatever

There was some interest a few years ago in aspartame lowering
seizure thresholds but I dont believe anything ever came of it
