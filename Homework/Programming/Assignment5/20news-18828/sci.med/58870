GB From gebcspittedu Gordon Banks
GB The HMO would stop the overordering but in HMOs tests are
GB underordered

Thats a somewhat overbroad statement  Im sure there are HMOs in
which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctors
income  In most however including the one I work for there is no
direct incentive to underorder  Profits of the group are shared
among all partners but the group is so large that an individuals
generated costs have a miniscule effect  I dont believe that we
underorder  Then again Im not really sure what the right amount
of ordering is or should be  Relative to the average British
neurologist I suspect that I rather drastically overorder
