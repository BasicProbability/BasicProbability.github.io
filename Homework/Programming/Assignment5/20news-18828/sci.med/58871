From npmnetcomcom Nancy P Milligan
Subject Re Need advice with doctorpatient relationship problem

Id dump him  Rude is rude and it seems he enjoys belittling and
humiliating you  But dont just dump him write to him and tell
him why you are firing him  If you can think about sending a copy
of your letter to whoever is in charge of the clinic where he works 
if applicable or maybe even to the AMA  Dont be vindictive in
your letter be truthful but VERY firm

But dont be a victim and just put up with it  Take control  Itll
make you feel great
