Heres your error  I really do think this shows some confusion on your
part  Drum roll please  Science isnt so much the gathering of evidence
to support an assertion read hypothesis as it is the gathering of
empirical observations IN ORDER TO MAKE AN HYPOTHESIS  What should
convince you or not shouldnt be the final product so much as HOW the
product was made 

Heres your error There is no observation or hypothesis that is not tainted
by theory I have a theory I make observations those observations will be
made with my theory in mind 

Yes absolutely though Id make the observation in a more general sense of
all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various
biases 

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once again 
to equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo produced

Science works very well at developing theories
within paradigms but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts If I 
develop a novel paradigm that explains homeopathy chinese medicine or 
spontaneous combustion If the paradigm is useful it will show me the way
to make observations that prove or disprove it

My point isnt so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how 
you come about developing it

The paradigm of modern medicine is that the body can be reduced to a set of
essentially mechanical operations wherein disease is seen as malfunctions in
the machinery essentially the old Newtonian model of the world It seems
likely that theories based upon this paradigm do not give a complete 
discription of the universe medicine healing etc Indeed we now 
recognize an important psychological component to healing 

Perhaps youd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topic
of the philosophy of science is made for them Im making them too but I
think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the 
business of doing science  Biomedical research doesnt make any basic 
assumptions that arent the same as any other discipline of scientific
research  That is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesis
and test it  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than 
the old Newtonian model of the world  And I doubt that many psychologists
would appreciate being put outside this empirical world view  Psychology
also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending 

It is also important to distinguish reason from science Science may be
reasonable but so are many nonscientific methodologies Aristotle reasoned
that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle 

Oversimplified of course but a good example  This is an empirical observa
tion  It was then tested though perhaps not by Aristotle and eventually 
found wanting  In the meantime some folk will 
have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life  
Theres nothing at all surprising about this its the way the gathering of
knowledge works  There are probably more than a few things in my own 
discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally offbase
even idiotic to someone in the future  These future people wont have come
to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zenlike and had 
a vision in an LSD trip  Someone will have thought of something new and 
tested it  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting
science and research cant seem to wrap their minds around  Science is a 
creative process  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally
turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories  

Again I think it gets down to defining what you mean by science  I often
dont recognize what it is that I do and am involved in in the way science
is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities  They
portray science as a collection of immutable facts pronouncements of TRUTH
in big gold letters  Thats silly  Its as though we just go into the lab
turn over a stone and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula
tion  Its much more interesting than that  It really is a very human
process
