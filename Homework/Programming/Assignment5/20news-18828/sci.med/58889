What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps
even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
petty hatreds

Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  The crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they arent of any use
unless they make you do some experiments  Ive known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they wont admit
out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
can end up being far removed from the actual daytoday of the grunt at the
bench  Yes its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the
lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
as long as my advisor doesnt catch me  which is easy enough to do but 
stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
committees and the peer review process in general  In todays world thats 
what determines what science is what gets funded  And a damn good thing to
Flights of fantasy just dont have much chance of producing anything at 
least not in biomedical research  The surest way for a graduate student to
ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with 
fleshing out hisher fantasies than with having the student work on a project
that actually has a good chance of producing some results  MDs seem to 
be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior  

Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments  He got very excited hoping that
hed seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays  The result was a wellconserved 400 or so bp sequence
that occurs about 500000 times in the human genome  Unfortunately for
Warrens fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome  On the other hand the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created
Other species have different sets of transposons  Fortunately for me
Warren and I used to eat dinner at TGI Fridays all the time

I have to agree with Gary Merrills response to this  Ive read alot of the
Alu and middle repetitive sequence work and its really very interesting 
good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics  Its 
really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting 
results that were unexpected
