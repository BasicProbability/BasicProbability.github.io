 My nearly13 year old Pomeranian had a nasty reaction to this vaccination
   Suffice it to say we will not
 vaccinate her for Lyme disease again  Shes been camping through some 6
 states and has backpacked with us as well and we are used to watching for ticks
 and dealing with them and we simply wont take her to really active Lyme
 disease areas

Not to drag this out anymore but

Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that
in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs
presenting with lameness swollen joints  fever

A recent paper March 1993 has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs
can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting  This has been
an ellusive matter for researchers and is one of the fundamental requirements
for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease
Up to now only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove that
the disease exists

This paper is noteworthy in two other regards

1 None of the animals they infected were treated in any way  The dogs
had episodes of lameness during a 68 week period which occurred 25
months after exposure  After this period none showed any further
clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study  So
these are proven clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous
recovery without the benefit of drug treatment Of course observations
longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesnt
have the same chronicity that some see in humans

2  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the
vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine  Of course they want
the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine
efficacy

Anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluations
of this vaccine in the next year or so
