Subject Re My New Diet  IT WORKS GREAT

 Keith is the only person I have ever heard of that keeps the weight
 off without any conscious effort to control eating behavior   most
 of us have to diet a lot to keep from going back to morbid obesity

I attribute my success to several factors

Very low fat  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me
I only eat fruit vegetables and whole grain or bran cereals  I
estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat

Very little sugar or salt

Very high fiber  Most Americans get about 10 grams  25 to 35 are
recommended  I get between 50 and 150  Sometimes 200  Ive heard
of people taking fiber pills  It seems unlikely that pills can
contain enough fiber to make a difference  It would be about as
likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills  Tablets are
just too small unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily

My clean your plate conditioning works for me  Eating the last
10 takes half my eating time and gives satiety a chance to catch
up so I dont still feel hungry and go start eating something else

I dont eat when Im not hungry unless Im sure Ill get hungry
shortly and eating wont be practical then

I bike to work 22 miles a day year round  Fast  I also bike to
stores movies and everywhere else as Ive never owned a car
I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day  It also helps
build and maintain muscle mass prevent insulin resistance diabetes
runs in my family and increase my metabolism  Even so my
metabolism is so low that when Im at rest Im most comfortable
with a temperature in the 90s F and usually wear a sweater if
it drops to 80  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess
ounce  Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that
weigh slightly less than others  But its easier and cheaper to trim
weight from the rider than from the vehicle

Theres no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically
different from that of most people who have never been fat  Fortunately
it isnt different in a way that precludes excellent health

Obviously I cant swear that every obese person who does what Ive
done will have the success I did  But Ive never yet heard of one who
did try it and didnt succeed

 I think all of us cycle  Ones success depends on how large the
 fluctuations in the cycle are  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds

Im sure everyones weight cycles whether or not theyve ever been fat
I usually eat extremely little salt  When I do eat something salty
my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds  It comes
off again over a week or two
