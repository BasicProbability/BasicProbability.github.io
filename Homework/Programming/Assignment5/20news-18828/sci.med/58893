Subject Re foodrelated seizures

I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
from the diet  The theory  which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
results  is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
chemicals than other people  I dont remember any connection being made
with seizures but it certainly couldnt hurt to try an allnatural diet
