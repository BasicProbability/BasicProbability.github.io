	Human glucose 70  110 mgdL fasting 2

Are these numbers for whole blood or plasma

	Serum actually but plasma numbers are the same  Whole blood
	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower  I find the following range for whole blood in
	FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY N W Teitz editor W B
	Saunders 1987

	Human glucose whole blood fasting levels  60  95 mgdL

Which are the strips calibrated for  Obviously they measure whole blood

	Indeed they do measure whole blood levels although they are not
	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory  One problem is
	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the
	sample is drawn reducing the apparent level  According to Teitz
	however results compare reasonably well with laboratory results
	although values below 80 mgdL tend to be lower with strip tests
	whereas values above 240 mgdL can be very erratic

What is the conversion factor between human plasma glucose and
whole blood pin prick glucose concentration

	As stated above whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 
	percent lower than serum levels  Sample freshness will affect
	whole blood levels however  I dont believe there is a well
	defined conversion factor since cell metabolism will affect
	samples to varying degrees  The serumplasma test is much 
	preferred for any except general ball park testing
