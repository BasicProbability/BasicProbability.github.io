Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses

You mean the responses some of which pointed to doubleblind tests
which show no such chinese restaurant effect unique to MSG
its elicited by the placebo as well

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories
Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill 

Similarly debunking such claims without doing research whether
literature and lab is equally beside the point The original poster
no doubt already knows that some people think Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome is bogus

Placebos are all very interesting but irrelevant to the question of
what effects MSG has You could have real effects and placebo
effects people may have allergies in addition 


Yet again the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of

Like youself  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition

Have you read Olneys work I fail to see how citing results from
peerreviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked

For cites on MSG look up almost anything by John W Olney a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive

No its undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
which is an excitatory neurotransmitter  There is also evidence that
excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
conditions like stroke drowning and Lou Gehrigs disease just to name a few
This is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid
in foods  People are not receiving intraventricular injections of glutamate

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intraventricular  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC
Intraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies
for obvious reasons You must not have read the peerreviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk

Too much in the diet and the system gets thrown off

Sez you  Such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
controlled studies  Infant mice and other models are useful as far
as they go but theyre not relevant to the matter at hand  Which is
not to say that I favor its use in things like baby fooda patently
ridiculous use of the additive  But we have no reason to believe
that MSG in the diet effects humans adversely

Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the
journals Have you done a thorough literature search

But youre right mice arent the best to study this on Theyre four
times less sensitive than humans to MSG

Glutamate and aspartate also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts and are freely available in many foods but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food

Wrong  Do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink
Milligrams worth  Compare that to a glass of milk  Do you know how much
glutamate is present in most proteincontaining foods compared to that
added by the use of MSG

The point is exceeding the window Of course theyre amino acids
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine

Olneys research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount
of freely available Glu in mothers milk versus commercial baby foods
vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processed
foods Mothers milk was well below the effective dose


Read Olneys review paper in Prog Brain Res 1988 and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

Impeccable  There most certainly is a dispute

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever
