I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
from the diet  The theory  which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
results  is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
chemicals than other people  I dont remember any connection being made
with seizures but it certainly couldnt hurt to try an allnatural diet

Yeah the Feingold Diet is a load of crap  Children diagnosed with ADD
who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
social skills which in fact continue to decline  Of course the parents
who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
childrens development  So much for the value of interesting anecdotal
results  People will believe anything if they want to
