 Flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common  The crucial
 thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they arent of any use
 unless they make you do some experiments  
 
 Simple example Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
 electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments  He got very excited 

But why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy
While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious
that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was
at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance
of current theory coupled with his observations  It would appear that
something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation
into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation  

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window or
dreaming or having a fantasy  or watching an apple fall Newton or
sitting in a bath Archimedes  it is ultimately the result of a lot of
intense scientific thinking done beforehand  Letting ones mind roam
freely and giving rein to ones intuition can be a useful way of coming
up with new ideas but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis
of the problem first  

Scientific intuition is not something one is born with  It is something
that one learns  Maybe we dont understand completely how it is learned
but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the 
key elements in developing it  

Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new
scientific ideas  One thinks for instance of Darwins naturalistic
studies in the Galapagos islands which led him to the ideas for the 
theory of evolution  

This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes
empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal
exploration as important scientific work  I agree that mere speculation
does not deserve to be called science  I also think that mere empirical
studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very
poor kind of science

I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes
   Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great
science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre
science that makes smaller steps  In most of this thread I have
been concerned with the difference between what is science and
what is not 

I dont think that science should be defined in a way that some of the
activities that lead to really important science  namely thinking and
informal exploration  are not recognized as scientific work  


In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems 
less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects
