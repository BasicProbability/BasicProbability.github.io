Subject Frequent nosebleeds


I have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week as a result of a genetic
predisposition to weak capillary walls OslerWeberRendu Fortunately
each nosebleed is of short duration

Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency My younger brothers
each tried a skin transplant thigh to nose lining but their nosebleeds
soon returned Ive seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that is
supposed to help and Id like to hear of experiences with it or other
techniques
