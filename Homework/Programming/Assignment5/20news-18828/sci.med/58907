Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

Many people responded with more anecdotal stories I think its safe to
say the original poster is already familiar with such stories
Presumably he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims about
MSG making people ill 

There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill
Thats the point after all

Like youself  Someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
do with the use of this substance in human nutrition
Have you read Olneys work I fail to see how citing results from
peerreviewed studies qualifies as bizarrely cracked

Thats because these peerreviewed studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people theyre looking at animal models
You cant walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans  Note that I wouldnt have any argument
with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro
duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its
use in humans  This is precisely NOT what you said

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intraventricular  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC
Intraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies
for obvious reasons You must not have read the peerreviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk

It most certainly is for neurotoxicology  You know studies of
glutamate involve more than food science

Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the
journals Have you done a thorough literature search

So point us to the studies in humans please  Im familiar with
the literature and Ive never seen any which relate at all to
Olneys work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons

The point is exceeding the window Of course theyre amino acids
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine

Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine its a
essential amino acid  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood

Olneys research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount
of freely available Glu in mothers milk versus commercial baby foods
vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processed
foods Mothers milk was well below the effective dose

Goodness Im not saying that its good to feed infants a lot of
glutamatesupplemented foods  Its just that this projected safety
margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that
you can prove anything you like  Were talking prudent policy in
infant nutrition here yet youre misrepresenting it as received wisdom

Read Olneys review paper in Prog Brain Res 1988 and check his
sources They are impecable There is no dispute

Impeccable  There most certainly is a dispute

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever 

You mean asserting  Youre being intellectually dishonest or just
plain confused because youre conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other  Olneys reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants but thats not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious
reasons  It says nothing about MSGs contribtion to the phenomenon
of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab

Hmm com Why am I not surprised

Probably one of the dumber remarks youve made
