Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency My younger brothers
each tried a skin transplant thigh to nose lining but their nosebleeds
soon returned Ive seen a reference to an herb called Rutin that is
supposed to help and Id like to hear of experiences with it or other
techniques

Rutin is a bioflavonoid compounds found among other places in the
rinds of citrus fruits  These have been popular especially in Europe
to treat capillary fragility and seemingly in even more extreme cases
a few months ago a friend was visiting from Italy and he said that hed
had hemorrhoids but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills  Incredulously
I asked to look at them and sure enough these contained rutin as the active
ingredient  I probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical
sputtering  I have no idea how hes doing hemorrhoidwise these days
The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in
human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled so the
reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal

This stuff is pretty much nontoxic and probably inexpensive so theres
little risk of trying it but I wouldnt expect much of a result
