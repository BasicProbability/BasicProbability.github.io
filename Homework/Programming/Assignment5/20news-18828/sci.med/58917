Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever 
 
 You mean asserting  Youre being intellectually dishonest or just
 plain confused because youre conflating reports which do not necessarily
 have anything to do with each other  Olneys reports would argue a potential
 for problems in human infants but thats not to say that this says anything
 whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any
 studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious
 reasons  It says nothing about MSGs contribtion to the phenomenon
 of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome  It says nothing about the frequent
 inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab


Okay Mr Dyer were properly impressed with your philosophical skills and
ability to insult people Youre a wonderful speaker and an adept politician
However I believe that all you were asked to do was simply provide scientific
research refuting the work of Olney I dont think the original poster sought
to start a philisophical debate she wanted some information Given a little
effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a 45 before breakfast is a
healthy practice But were not particularily interested in what you can
verbally provedisprove or rationalize Wheres the research Where are the
studies

I appoligize if this sounds flamish I simply would like to see the thread get
back on track
