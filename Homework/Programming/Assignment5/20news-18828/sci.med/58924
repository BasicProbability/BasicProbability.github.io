Subject Re Too many MRIs

In article 1q6riemo2accessdigexnet kflaccessdigexcom Keith F Lynch writes

So why are the scans so expensive and what can be done to reduce the
expense  Isnt it just a box with some big magnets a radio transmitter
and an attached PC

The magnets are huge  Good MRI sets with big 15 Tesla magnets
cost millions of dollars  Then the radiologist wants 400 for
reading each scan

gebcadredslpittedu     it is shameful to surrender it too soon
