 From the NEJMed  editorial  The dicarboxylic amino acid glutamate
 is not only an essential amino acid 

Glutamate is not an essential amino acid  People can survive quite well
without ever eating any

There is no contradiction here It is essential in the sense that your
body needs it It is nonessential in the sense that your body can
produce enough of it without supplement
