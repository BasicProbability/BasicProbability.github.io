There is no contradiction here It is essential in the sense that your
body needs it It is nonessential in the sense that your body can
produce enough of it without supplement

And when youre in a technical discussion of amino acids its the latter

Disclaimer  Hey I understand VAXen and VMS  Thats what I get paid for  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
