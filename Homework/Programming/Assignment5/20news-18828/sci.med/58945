 Once again we are waiting I have been thinking that it would be good
 to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any
 experience with this kind of thing  I know that members of the medical
 community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and
 foods play in our general health and wellbeing  Anyway as you can
 guess I am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas
 anyone out there has  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get
 across what is going on here
 
 
I dont know anything specifically but I have one further anecdote A
colleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease tuberous
sclerosis Along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder
The parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was
a meal with corn in it I have always wondered about the connection and
further about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures
Other experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters
