  Ron Roth recommends Once you have your hypoglycemia CONFIRMED through the 
                        proper channels you might consider ther following
                        diet omitted

1 Ronwhat do YOU consider to be proper channelsthis sounds suspiciously
like a blood chemistryglucose tolerance and the likesuddenly chemistry 
exists You know perfectly well that this person can be saved needless trouble 
and expense with simple muscle testing and hair analysis to diagnoseno
CONFIRM any aberrant physiologybut then againmaybe thats what you meantby proper channels

2 Were you able to understand Dick Kings post that 90 of diseases is not thesame thing as 90 of patients which was a reply to your inability to critically
evaluate the statistic you cited from the New England Journal of Medicine Couldyou figure out what is implied by the remark Of course MDs are ethically bound to not knowingly dispense placebos

3 Ronhave you ever thought about why you never post in mischealthalterna
tiveand insist instead upon insinuating your untrained nonmedical often 
delusional notions of health and disease into this forum I suspect from your
apparent anger toward MDs and heteropathic medicine that there may be an
underlying father problemof course I can CONFIRM this by surrogate muscle
testing one of my patients while they ponder my theory to see if one of their  
previously weak indicator muscles strengthensor do you have reservations
about my unique methods of diagnosis OhI forgot what you said in an earlier
postneither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your or
anyone elses criteria of acceptance
