Subject Re Need advice with doctorpatient relationship problem

In article C5L9qB4y5athenacsugaedu mcovingtaisun3aiugaedu Michael Covington writes
Sounds as though his hearts in the right place but he is not adept at
expressing it  What you received was meant to be a profound apology
Apologies delivered by overworked shy people often come out like that

His heart This jerk doesnt have a heart and it beats me why youre
apologizing for him In my book behavior like this is unprofessional
inexcusable and beyond the pale If hes overworked its because hes too
busy raking in the bucks More likely he just likes to push women around
Id fire the sob and get myself another doctor
