Subject Placebo effects

I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or 
even gets better because of hisher belief in the medicine and 
the doctor administering it  Is there also an antiplacebo 
effect where the patient dislikesdistrusts doctors and medicine 
and therefore doesnt get better or feel better in spite of the 
medicine

Is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a 
medicine that heshe sees improvement where the is none or sees 
more improvement than there is  If so what is this effect 
called  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor 
doesnt believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than 
there is  What would this effect be called  Have these effects 
ever been studied  How common are these effects  Thank you in 
advance for all replies 

 Information is very valuable but disinformation is MUCH more common
