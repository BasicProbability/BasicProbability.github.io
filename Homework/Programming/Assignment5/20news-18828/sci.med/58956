Subject Help  Looking for a Medical Journal Article  WhiplashCervical Pain

Hi
I am not sure where to post this message please contact me if Im way off
the mark
On 19393 my wife went to her General Practitioner Doctor He mentioned
an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us He had
read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again
The article was about Whiplash InjuryCervical Pain It mentions the use of
a MRI Magnetic Resonance Imagery machine as a diagnostic tool and the work
of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain
This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal I very much
want to obtain the name of the article journal and author because the case
matches my wife We would very much appreciate anyones help in this matter
via email preferably
