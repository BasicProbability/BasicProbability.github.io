Is there such a thing as MSG monosodium glutamate sensitivity
I saw in the NY Times Sunday that scientists have testified before
an FDA advisory panel that complaints about MSG sensitivity are
superstition Anybody here have experience to the contrary

I know that there is MSG sensitivity  When I eat foods with MSG I get
very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash I first
experienced this problem when I worked close to Chinatown and ate Chinese
food almost everyday for lunch  Now I cant tolerate MSG at all  I can
notice immediately when I have eaten any  I try to avoid MSG completely

Interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
the exact same rash on their hands  I couldnt understand why because I
dont MSG in cooking and we ask for no MSG when we do eat Chinese I still
love it  After some investigation I knew that Oodles of Noodles where
one of their favorite foods  One of the main ingredients in the flavor
packets is MSG  Now I look at all labels  You would be surprised at
places you find MSG
