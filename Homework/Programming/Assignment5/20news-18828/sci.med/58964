Subject Whats the Difference Between an MD and a DO

My wife and I are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our
first child due June 15th  We interviewed a young doctor last week
and were very impressed with her  However I discovered that she is
actually not an Medical Doctor MD but rather a Doctor of 
Osteopathy DO  Whats the difference  I believe the pediatrician
I went to for many years was a DO and he didnt seem different from
any other doctor Ive seen over the years

My dictionary says that osteopathy is a medical therapy that emphasizes
manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought
to cause disease and inhibit recovery

Jeez this sounds like chiropractic  I remember getting shots and
medicine from my pediatrician DO and dont remember any 
manipulative techniques  Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
the real practical difference between an MD and a DO  Also Im
interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who
follows one or the other medical philosophy
