Subject Re eye dominance

In article C5E2G7877worldstdcom rsilverworldstdcom Richard Silver writes

Is there a righteye dominance eyedness as there is an
overall righthandedness in the population I mean do most
people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the
other If so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this

There is eye dominance same as handedness and usually for the
same side  It has nothing to do with refractive error however
