   I remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
   which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
   from the diet  The theory  which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
   results  is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
   chemicals than other people  I dont remember any connection being made
   with seizures but it certainly couldnt hurt to try an allnatural diet

   Yeah the Feingold Diet is a load of crap  Children diagnosed with ADD
   who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
   social skills which in fact continue to decline  Of course the parents
   who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
   childrens development  So much for the value of interesting anecdotal
   results  People will believe anything if they want to

Thanks for all the interest in this problem of mine I dont think it
is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown
any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food
She has always been very calm and dare I say a neat smart kid

The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
by Kellogs makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
something in the coating or the cereals  Of the four of us in our
immediate family Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever running
nose itchy eyes etc but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
including some weird food allergies  nuts mushrooms 

Anyway our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body
chemistry  But so far no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures
either  Every day that goes by without one makes me heave a sigh of
relief  Thanks again
