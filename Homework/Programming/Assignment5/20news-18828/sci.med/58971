Ive been invited to spend a couple weeks this summer rafting down the
Mississippi  My journey partners want to live off of river water and
catfish along the route  Should I have any concerns about pollution or
health risks in doing this

Youd have to purify the river water first  Im not sure how practical
that is with the Mississippi  Youd better check with health agencies
along the way to see if there are toxic chemicals in the river  If
it is just microorganisms those can be filtered or killed but you
may need activated charcoal or other means to purify from chemicals
Better be same than sorry  Obviously drinking the river without
processing it is likely to make you sick from bacteria and parasites
