Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on AE  some 15 years
since I saw it last  

Wow the WWII channel did something notWWII

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film
for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances
Clearly they faked a lot of the computer  robotic technology
certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction
itself let alone the idea of a space germ  

The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie 
audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers  The book was more 
realistic in that respect  In all respects actually  The robotics are 
still out of range but not impossible

Quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to see
the movie again I watched a segment on the otherwise awful Howd
They Do That dealing with a disease researcher at the CDCs top
lab  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken
so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or
nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps  And
the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the film

SF and Ive always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution  NASAs 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters  I mean NASA scientists were often SF readers and 
sometimes writers and felt prewarned by their reading

Im curious what people think about this film  short of silly
Is such a facility technically feasible today  

I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films but that isnt 
saying a whole lot

As far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not Life
As We Know It thats a whole nother argument for recartssftech
or something

Yep
