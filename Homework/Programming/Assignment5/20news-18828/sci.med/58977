From davpaidaliuse David Partain
Subject Candida Albicans what is it


Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans 
a disease about which I can find no information  Apparently it has something
to do with the bodys production of yeast while at the same time being highly
allergic to yeast  Can anyone out there tell me any more about it

Thanks
