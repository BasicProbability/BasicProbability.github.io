There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill
Thats the point after all

Why dont you just look it up in the Merk Or check out the medical dictionary
cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread



Thats because these peerreviewed studies are not addressing
the effects of MSG in people theyre looking at animal models
You cant walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
demonstrated in humans  Note that I wouldnt have any argument
with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro
duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its
use in humans  This is precisely NOT what you said

Among others see Olneys  Excitotoxic Food Aditives  Relevance of
Animal Studies to Human Safety 1982 Neurobehav Toxicol Teratol
vol 6 455462

Im sure PETA would love to hear your arguments

Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys as well I have never seen a
study where the mode of administration was intraventricular  The Glu
and Asp were administered orally Some studies used IV and SC
Intraventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies
for obvious reasons You must not have read the peerreviewed works
that I referred to or you would never have come up with this brain
injection bunk

It most certainly is for neurotoxicology  You know studies of
glutamate involve more than food science

Whose talking about food science What is this comment supposed to
mean Neurotoxicology and Tratology Brain Research Nature
Progress in Brain Research all fine food science journals 

Pardon me but where are you getting this from Have you read the
journals Have you done a thorough literature search

So point us to the studies in humans please  Im familiar with
the literature and Ive never seen any which relate at all to
Olneys work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons

Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to
Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in a few articles Why dont you point
us to some studies Maybe then this exchange could be productive

The point is exceeding the window Of course theyre amino acids
Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine

Well actually they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine its a
essential amino acid  They just try to get as little as is healthy
without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
in the blood

Theyre unable to metabolise it

Olneys research compared infant human diets Specifically the amount
of freely available Glu in mothers milk versus commercial baby foods
vs typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged
soup mixes He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin
for infant humans by at least fourfold in a single meal of processed
foods Mothers milk was well below the effective dose

Goodness Im not saying that its good to feed infants a lot of
glutamatesupplemented foods  Its just that this projected safety
margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that
you can prove anything you like  Were talking prudent policy in
infant nutrition here yet youre misrepresenting it as received wisdom

Who said anything about received wisdom There is no question that
orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median
eminence These areas are responsible for the production of
hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal
development of the vertabrate organism Humans are vertebrates Now
what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain
necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing
Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary
ANH and ME of that part of the brain that is responsible for
controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone 

How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this Its unethical to
sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses
of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans  The food
industry knows this Thats why the animal model is used in medicine
and psych  If youre talking about straight sensitivity it would be
useful to define the term  There are plenty of studies on
psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and
physiology

I suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities
You and lateoccuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its
implication for adults me  Certainly
the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than
for the young but the additivity of Glu and Asp and their copious
and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their
hidden presence in HVP necessitates extreme caution Why would anyone
want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the
endocrine system in adults  The main point is blood levels
attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC 

Between who Over what I would be most interested in seeing you
provide peerreviewed nonfoodindustryfunded citations to articles
disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever 

You mean asserting  Youre being intellectually dishonest or just
plain confused because youre conflating reports which do not necessarily
have anything to do with each other  Olneys reports would argue a potential
for problems in human infants but thats not to say that this says anything
whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods nor does he provide any
studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious
reasons  It says nothing about MSGs contribtion to the phenomenon
of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome  It says nothing about the frequent
inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab

Olneys work provides a putative causal mechanism for some
sensitivities Terry Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally
administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone
fluctutations in adults Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant
supression of rhythmic GH secretion and to induce rapid and transient
release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG GH is
responsible not only for control of growth during development but
also converts glycogen into glucose Could this be the cause of
headaches I dont know

Probably one of the dumber remarks youve made

If you had read Olneys review article especially the remarks I
already quoted in an earlier post you would know to what I was
alluding May I ask exactly for whom you do computer consulting
