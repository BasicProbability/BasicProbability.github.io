 I have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week as a result of a genetic 
 predisposition to weak capillary walls OslerWeberRendu 
 Fortunately each nosebleed is of short duration 
 
 Does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency My younger 
 brothers each tried a skin transplant thigh to nose lining but their 
 nosebleeds soon returned Ive seen a reference to an herb called Rutin 
 that is supposed to help and Id like to hear of experiences with it 
 or other techniques 
  


My 6 year son is so plagued  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
to keep it under control  But let him get bopped there and hell recur for 
days  Also allergies colds dry air all seem to contribute  But again the 
vaseline or AD ointment or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring
