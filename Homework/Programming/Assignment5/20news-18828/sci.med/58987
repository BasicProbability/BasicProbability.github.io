Subject Re Barbecued foods and health risk

While in grad school I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with
heat shock proteins Apparently burning protein will induce changes in he
DNA Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion
I dont know but I never eat burnt food because of this 

Also many woods contain toxins As they are burnt it would seem logical that
some may volatilise and get into the BBQed food Again I dont know if these
toxins antifungal and antiwoodeater compounds would survive the rather harsh
conditions of the stomach and intestine and then would they be able to cross
the intestinal mucosa

Maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself which is almost
anyone  can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that
may be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ
