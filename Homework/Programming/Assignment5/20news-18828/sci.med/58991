all over my bod  At what point am I no longer infectious  My physicians
office says when they are all scabbed over  Is this true

Yes

Is there any medications which can promote healing of the pox  Speed up
healing

Acyclovir started in the first 12 days probably speeds recovery and
decreases the formation of new pox
