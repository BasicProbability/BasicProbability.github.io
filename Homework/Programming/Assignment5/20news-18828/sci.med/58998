restaurants advertize No MSG  many restaurants that feature salad
bars use MSG to keep the veggies looking fresh longer also a number
 
This brings up an important question for me  could premade salads the
kind sold in supermarkets have MSG added without mentioning it Legally
I mean  anyone know what the law is in this area


Steve Dyer points out that Sharen was probably thinking of Sulfites But
the question still stands
