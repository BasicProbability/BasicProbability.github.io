I recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me
intravenous Acyclovir

It was a pain finding IV sites in my armscan I have some facts about
how advantageous it is to give intravenous antibiotics rather than oral


I think some essential information must be missing here ie you must be
suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression  There is
no indication for IV acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
person  The oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms and may
even help prevent the development of postherpetic neuralgia but I
certainly would not subject someone to IV therapy without a good reason

To address your more general question IV therapy does provide higher and
more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug  For treating a
serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
getting adequate drug levels
