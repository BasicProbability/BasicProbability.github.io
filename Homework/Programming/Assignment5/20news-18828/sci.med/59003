As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
question WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD I must assume
that my wifes answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was
I dont mean to be disrespectful to your concerns but it seems to me 
that youre getting all wound up in a nonissue  

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out msg is a naturally 
occurring substance in a lot if not most foods  When food 
manufacturers add it to a preparation they do so because its a 
known flavor enhancer 

Your wifes theory that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite 
may well be true  But I dont believe its ALWAYS the reason its 
added  People are largely for the most part in charge of their 
own appetites 

childrens and my parents seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
food The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
brand  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference but some
sort of chemical training or addiction My questions for the net are
Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food  Is it allowed for pet
food to contain addictive or conditioning substances  Is MSG put in 
pet food

You dont know much about cats do you 

Cats will Take Advantage of You  Resign yourself  you will never  
understand a cat  Their tastes are whimsical  

I also suspect though its been a while since Ive checked ingredients 
on commercial cat food that there are much more stringent requirements 
on pet food additives than human  

See the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence 
to look out after their own interests
