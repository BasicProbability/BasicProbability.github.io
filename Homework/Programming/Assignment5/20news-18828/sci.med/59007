Subject Re Barbecued foods and health risk

Mark McWiggins markmchalcyoncom reminds us

MM Also dont forget that its better for your health 
MM to enjoy your steak than to resent your sprouts 

YES

I call this notion psychological health food and in fact have
determined that the Four Food Groups are Ice Cream Pizza Barbecue and
Chocolate  Ideally every meal should contain something from at least two
of these four groups  Food DOES serve functions other than nutrition and
one of them is keeping the organism happy and thus aiding its immune
system 

And I didnt spend a million bucks commissioning a study that told me to
redraw my silly little pyramid in different colors and with a friendlier
typeface either  Ref Consumer Reports back pageone of the best
things ever to turn up there

Rich Young youngserumkodakcom writes of one of six impossible things
RY to consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a time

Donald Mackie DonaldMackiemedumichedu confesses
DM I have to confess that this is one of my few unfulfilled ambitions
DM No matter how much I eat it still seems realistic

Yeah I want to try one of those 42oz steaks cooked over applewood at
Wallys Wolf Lodge Inn in Coeur dAlene  That seems quite
unrealisticunrealistically SMALL  And a few slabs of ribs from the East
Texas Smoker RIP again in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either  

What say we have a recfoodcooking dinner at the Moonlite BarBQue Inn in
Owensboro Its all you can eat including lamb ribs  mutton for about
10  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the
Moonlites Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her  It IS too hot for me and I
dont say that very often  And she could bring ice cream with crushed
dried chiltepins for dessert  

And we could see if there IS such a thing as an unrealistically large
quantity of barbecuethe owner of the Moonlite estimates that the
Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the
summer and forty thousand in the winterin a town of 50 000 or so  Two
pounds per person per week   Again sure sounds unrealistic to methats
just too meager to be healthy

 Kiran Now a twopound slab of ribs a day THATs realistic
