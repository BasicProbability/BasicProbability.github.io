My 6 year son is so plagued  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
to keep it under control  But let him get bopped there and hell recur for 
days  Also allergies colds dry air all seem to contribute  But again the 
vaseline or AD ointment or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring

If you can get it you might want to try a Canadian overthecounter product
called Secaris which is a watersoluble gel  Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture thats
already there
