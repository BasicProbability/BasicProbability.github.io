Subject Re OBGYN residency

reply to gebcspittedu Gordon Banks
 
I believe it is illegal for a residency to discriminate against FMGs
 
Is that true  I know some that wont even interview FMGs
 
I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory particularly
if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasnt
offered an interview but I dont know if it has ever gone to court
