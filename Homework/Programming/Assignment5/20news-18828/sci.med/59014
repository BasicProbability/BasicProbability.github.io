Subject Re MORBUS MENIERE  is there a real remedy

It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow beat the system
and like a space explorer boldly go where no man has gone before and
return with a prize cure Unfortunately too often the prize is limited
and the efficacy of the cure questionable when applied to all
sufferers

This applies to both medical researchers and nonmedical individuals
Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use
does not make the next cureall What about the dozens of individuals
who have courageously participated in clinical trials Did they have any
guarentee of cures Are they any less because they didnt trumpet their
story all over the world

As a parting note wasnt there some studies done on Gingko seeds for
Menieres To the original poster  what about trying for a trial of
that Its probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate
some of the discomfort And youd be helping answer the question for
future sufferers
