Subject Re Lasers for dermatologists

It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age in
fact lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field

It probably wont be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is
usually a superficial burn to avoid any deeper damage Limited tinea
pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as
well as systemic medication ie tablets Finally a selfdiagnosis is
not always reliable lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal
infection and requires very different treatment
