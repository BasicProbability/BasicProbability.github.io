 Is there a righteye dominance eyedness as there is an
 overall righthandedness in the population I mean do most
 people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the
 other If so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this
 
 There is eye dominance same as handedness and usually for the
 same side  It has nothing to do with refractive error however
 
 I recall readingseeing that former baseball star Chris Chambliss hitting
 abilities were in part attributed to a combination of lefthandedness 
 righteye dominance
 
I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to
see whether cross dominant individuals those with a particular handedness
but who had dominance in the opposite eye were better hitters than
those with same side dominance of hand and eye  I was picked from
my softball class because I was cross dominant right hand left eye
which put me in a small minority and the grad student was trying to get
an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people  To
control the study she used a pitching machine  fast pitch  Since
I was used to slow pitch I didnt come close actually I think
I foul tipped a few to hitting the ball  If there were a lot of people
like me in her study ie those who cant hit fast pitch or are
not used to hitting off a machine  I would seriously question the
results of that study  I think there have been some studies of major
league players across a fairly large cross section of players to test
whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was better 
but I dont know the results  The woman who ran the study I was in
said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major
leaguers than across the general population  but Im not sure
whether Id believe her
