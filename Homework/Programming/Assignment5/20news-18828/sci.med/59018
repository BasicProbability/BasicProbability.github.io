 My family doctor and the physiotherapist PT she sent me to agree that the
 pain in my left shoulder is bursitis I have an appointment with an orthpod
 I love that its short for orthopedic surgeon apparently but while Im
 waiting the PT is treating me
 
 Shes using hot packs ultrasound and lasers but theres no improvement
 yet In fact I almost suspect its getting worse
 
 My real question is about the laser treatment I cant easily imagine what
 the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem Can anyone
 shed some light so to speak on the matter

If it works its only due to the heat produced by the laser
