Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans 
a disease about which I can find no information  Apparently it has something
to do with the bodys production of yeast while at the same time being highly
allergic to yeast  Can anyone out there tell me any more about it

Candida albicans can cause severe lifethreatening infections usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill  This is not however the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing

Systemic yeast syndrome where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine  There
is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists
