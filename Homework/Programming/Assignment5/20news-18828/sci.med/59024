Chinese and many other Asians Japanese Koreans etc have used
MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years Do you believe that
they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes Not They just
extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth

And to add further fuel to the flame war I read about 20 years ago that
the natural MSG  extracted from the sources you mention above  does not
cause the reported aftereffects its only that nasty artificial MSG 
extracted from coal tar or whatever  that causes Chinese Restaurant
Syndrome  I find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it

I was under the possibly incorrect assumption that most of the MSG on
our foods was made from processing sugar beets Is this not true Are 
there other sources of MSG

I am one of those folx who react sometimes strongly to MSG However
I also react strongly to sodium chloride table salt in excess Each
causes different symptoms except for the common one of rapid heartbeat
and an uncomfortable feeling of pressure in my chest upper left quadrant
