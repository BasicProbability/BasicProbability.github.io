Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

MSG is common in many food we eat including Chinese though some oriental
restaurants might put a tad too much in them  Ive noticed that when I
go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants I will usually get
a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards  This happens to many
of my friends and relatives too  And heh we eat Chinese food all the
time at home  but we dont use MSG when were cooking for ourselves

So when we put one and one together it can be safely assumed that
MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people

Stick with natural things  MSG doesnt do body any good and possibly
harms for that matter  So why bother with it  Taste food as it should
be tasted and dont cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG
