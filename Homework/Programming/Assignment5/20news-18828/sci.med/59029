	In case you dont know Krillean Photography to the best of my
knowledge involves taking pictures of an most of the time organic
object between charged plates The picture will show energy patterns
or spikes around the object photographed and depending on what type
of object it is the spikes or energy patterns will vary One might
extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
the universe as we know it has its own energy signature

Go to the library and look up corona discharge

Disclaimer  Hey I understand VAXen and VMS  Thats what I get paid for  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
