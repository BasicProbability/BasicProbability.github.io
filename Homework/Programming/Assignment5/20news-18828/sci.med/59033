Subject seizures  infantile spasms 


	The reason Im posting this article to this newsgroup is to
1 gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might
   have recently been effected by it  from being associated with
   it or actually having this disorder  and
2 help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated
   with seizures over the internet

Recently I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 1215 hours
after birth He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston
and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition
This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in
learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with
hospitals proceduresetc

I dont want to go into a lot of detail but his condition was termed 
quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight
as a normal baby would He was put on the standard anticonvulsion drugs
and that did not seem to help out His MRI EKG catscans are all normal
but the EEGs show alot of seizure activity After many metabolic tests
body structure tests and infectionvirus tests the doctors still do not
know quite what type of siezures he is having although they do have alot
of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms  This is where
we stand right now

If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above
any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing
from you I am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gather
information about it As I know now these particular types of disorders
are still not really well understood by the medical community and so Im
going to see nowif somehow the internet can at least give me alittle
insight Thanks
