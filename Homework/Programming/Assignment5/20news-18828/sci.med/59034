Someone I know has recently been diagnosed as having Candida Albicans 
a disease about which I can find no information  Apparently it has something
to do with the bodys production of yeast while at the same time being highly
allergic to yeast  Can anyone out there tell me any more about it

Candida albicans can cause severe lifethreatening infections usually
in people who are otherwise quite ill  This is not however the sort
of illness that you are probably discussing

Systemic yeast syndrome where the body is allergic to
yeast is considered a quack diagnosis by mainstream medicine  There
is a book The Yeast Connection which talks about this illness

There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists

Theres a lot of evidence it just hasnt been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used

For example Dr Ivker who wrote the book Sinus Survival always gives
before any other treatment a systemic antifungal such as Nizoral to his
new patients IF theyve been on braodspectrum antibiotics 4 or more times
in the last two years  Hes kept a record of the results and for over 
2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relief
of allergicsinus symptoms  Of course this is only the beginning for his
program

In my case as I reported a few weeks ago I was developing the classic
symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection I agree it is a poorly 
written book  eg extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which
I never had before started in November  Within one week of full dosage
of Sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared  I can
now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes  Im also
greatly improved in other areas as well

Of course I have allergy symptoms etc  I am especially allergic to
molds yeasts etc  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that
if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a
natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you
would have perceptible symptoms  Also yeast do produce toxins of various
sorts and again you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
such toxins can cause problems in some people  In my case it was sinus
since thats the center of my allergic response  Of course the 60000
question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed I was
from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionallydeficiencies because of the
stress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeast
colonization somewhere in the body  It is a tough question to answer since
testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy  One almost has to
take an empirical approach to diagnosis  Fortunately Sporanox is relatively
safe unlike past antifungals still have to be careful however so theres
no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons

BTW some would say to try Nystatin  Unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae
too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect  Youll find
a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time

In summary I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
medicine on the right road  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients  If anybody doctors included said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection I cannot guarantee
their safety  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned
