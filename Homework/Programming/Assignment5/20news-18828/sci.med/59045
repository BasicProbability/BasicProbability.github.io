Now Im not saying that culturing is the best way to diagnose its very
hard to culture Bb in most cases  The point is that Dr N has developed a
feel for what is and what isnt LD  This comes from years of experience
No serology can match that  Unfortunately some would call Dr N a quack
and accuse him of trying to make a quick buck

Why do you think he would be called a quack  The quacks dont do cultures
They poopoo doing more lab tests  this is Lyme believe me Ive
seen it many times  The lab tests arent accurate  Well treat it
now  Also is Dr Ns practice almost exclusively devoted to treating
Lyme patients  I dont know any orthopedic surgeons who fit this
pattern  They are usually GPs
 
 
Are you arguing that the Lyme lab test is accurate
The books that Ive read say that in general the tests
have a 5050 chance of being correct  The tests
result in a large number of both false positives and
false negatives  I am in the latter case

We could get those same odds by rolling the dice
