Subject Re Any info on Vasomotor Rhinitis

Disclaimer Im a sufferer not a doctor

Im not sure theres a really sharp distinction between allergic and
vasomotor rhinitis  Basically vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is
stuffy when it has no reason to be not even an identifiable allergy

Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis  Also
I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as
saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel
