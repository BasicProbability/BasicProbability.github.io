allergy tests and went down a checklist of drugs a photocopied 
sheet  Ive gained out 30 lbs since then though I havent eaten 
more or much differently than before Ivsuffered depression  
fatigue and Ive experienced a foul smell and sense of taste for 
about the last two months  I mentioned the lack of smell and taste to 
this Dr in Feb and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen he 
just looked up my nose with his little lightthe same one used for 
ears and prescribed Prednisone and Sulfatrim DS severe headaches 
and a rash resulted particularly after my weeks worth of Prednisone 
ran out  Now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if I have a bleeding 
ulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities  Im considering seeing another 
doctor  Any suggestionsadvice  Id really appreciate it
