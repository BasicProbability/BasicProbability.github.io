Subject Re Paxil request

I dont know much and in fact have asked questions here
myself My doctor told me that Paxil is a cleaner SRI in that
it produces fewer side effects As to a comparison between
Zoloft and Prozac Im not able to remember what he said about
the differences between those two drugs Sorry
