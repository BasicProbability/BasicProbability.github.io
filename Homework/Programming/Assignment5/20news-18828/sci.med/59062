Subject Burzynskis Antineoplastons
From jschwimmerwccnetwccwesleyanedu Josh Schwimmer

Ive recently listened to a tape by Dr Stanislaw Burzynski in which he 
claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti
cancer properties that he names antineoplastons  Burzynski says that his 
work has met with hostility in the United States despite the favorable 
responses of his subjects during clinical trials

What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr Burzynskis research  He 
paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an 
intolerant medical establishment but I have no basis from which to judge 
his claims  Two weeks ago however I read that the NIHs Department of 
Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynskis 
work  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldnt investigate a 
treatment that didnt seem promising

Any opinions on Burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current 
status of his research would be appreciated
