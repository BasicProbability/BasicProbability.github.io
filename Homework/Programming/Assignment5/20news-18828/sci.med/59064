Subject Altitude adjustment

I live at sealevel and am calledupon to travel to highaltitude cities
quite frequently on business  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
feet of altitude  One of them especially is very polluted

Often I feel faint the first two or three days  I feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  Also it is very
dry in these cities so I will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol

Thing is I still have symptoms  How can I ensure that my short trips there
no I dont usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
Is there something else that I could do

A long time ago possibly two years ago there was a discussion here about
altitude adjustment  Has anyone saved the messages

Many thanks

Vida
