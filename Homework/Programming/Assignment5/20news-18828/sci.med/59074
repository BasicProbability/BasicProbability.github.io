	   I am looking for any informationsupplies that will allow
   doityourselfers to take Krillean Pictures Im thinking
   that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for
   sale but I dont know any of the companies Any info is greatly
   appreciated
	   In case you dont know Krillean Photography to the best of my
   knowledge involves taking pictures of an most of the time organic
   object between charged plates The picture will show energy patterns
   or spikes around the object photographed and depending on what type
   of object it is the spikes or energy patterns will vary One might
   extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
   the universe as we know it has its own energy signature

There have been a number of scientific papers in peerreviewed journals
published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s  Sorry I cant be
more specific but it is a long time since I read them  They would describe
what is needed and how to set up the apparatus  

These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can
be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the
moisture in the object being photographed  It has nothing to do with the
energy signature of organic objects

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water
