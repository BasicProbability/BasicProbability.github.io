Good grief again

Why the anger  I must have really touched a raw nerve

Lets see  I had symptoms that resisted all other treatments  Sporanox
totally alleviated them within one week  Hmmm I must be psychotic  Yesss
Thats it  my illness was all in my mind  Thanks Steve for your correct
diagnosis  you must have a lot of experience being out there in trenches
treating hundreds of patients a week  Thank you  Im forever in your
debt

Jon

oops gotta run the men in white coats are ready to take me away haha
to the happy home where I can go twiddle my thumbs basket weave and
moan about my sinuses
