Subject RE  altpsychoactives

FYII just posted this on altpsychoactives as a response to
what the group is for


A note to the users of altpsychoactives

This group was originally a takeoff from scimed  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugssuch as antidepressentstricyclics Prozac Lithiumetc
antipsychoticsMelleralsp etc OCD drugsAnafranil etc and
so on and so forth  It didnt take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo altdrugs atmosphere  Thats to bad for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to scimed where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data

It was also to discuss reallife experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned

Oh well I had unsubscribed to this group for some time and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changednopesame old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderatedtoo bad

Oh well obviously no one really cares

Bill Claussen


Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group
