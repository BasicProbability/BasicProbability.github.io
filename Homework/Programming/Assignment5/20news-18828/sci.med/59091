Subject Re Good Grief  was Re Candida Albicans what is it

In article romdasuclinkberkeleyedu Ella I Baff writes

   If anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no
   evidence of the yeast connection I cannot guarantee their safety
   For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as
   I am concerned

This doesnt sound like Candida Albicans to me

No just a little anger  Normally I dont rip peoples lips off except
when my candida has overcolonized and I become  Fungus Man
