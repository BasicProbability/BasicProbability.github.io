Subject Need Reference  Multiple Personalities Disorders and Allergies

I heard thirdhand not the best form of information that there was recently
published results of a study on MultiplePersonalityDisorder Syndrome
patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may
have a psychological trigger or basis  What I heard about this study was that
in one personality a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs
of inhalant allergy scratch tests were used according to what I heard
while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms including
testing a full  on scratch tests for particular inhalants

If this is true it is truly fascinating

But Id like to know if this study was ever done and if so what the study
really showed and where the study is published  Any help out there
