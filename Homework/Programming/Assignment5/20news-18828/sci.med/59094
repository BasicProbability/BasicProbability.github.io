Can you provide a reference to substantiate that gaining back
the lost weight does not constitute weight rebound until it
exceeds the starting weight  Or is this oral tradition that
is shared only among you obesity researchers

Not one but two

Obesity in Europe 88
proceedings of the 1st European Congress on Obesity

Annals of NY Acad Sci 1987

Hmmm These dont look like references to me Is passiveaggressive
behavior associated with weight rebound
