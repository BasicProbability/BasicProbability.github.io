My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones She says that because she has no
medical insurance she cannot get them removed

My question Is there any way she can treat them herself or at least mitigate
their effects Any help is deeply appreciated Advice referral to literature

Morphine or demerol is about the only effective way of stopping pain
that severe  Obviously shell need a prescription to get such drugs
Cant she go to the county hospital or something
