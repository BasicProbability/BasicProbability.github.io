Subject Corneal erosionabrasions

For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion    There
does  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem  My current
episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea  If  its
bad  enough the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy  However my doctor
this time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to
protect the area  Apparently the problem is not that common but Id be curious
if anyone else out there has a similar problem perhaps to see if a cause can be
found
