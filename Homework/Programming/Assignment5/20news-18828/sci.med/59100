I live at sealevel and am calledupon to travel to highaltitude cities
quite frequently on business  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
feet of altitude  One of them especially is very polluted

Mexico City Bogota La Paz

Often I feel faint the first two or three days  I feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  Also it is very
dry in these cities so I will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol


Thing is I still have symptoms  How can I ensure that my short trips there
no I dont usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
Is there something else that I could do

Go three days early  Preliminary acclimatization takes 34 days  It
takes weeks or months for full acclimatization  Could you be
experiencing some jet lag too
