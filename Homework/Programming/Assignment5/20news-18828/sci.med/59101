There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists

Theres a lot of evidence it just hasnt been adequately gathered and
published in a way that will convince the diehard melancholic skeptics
who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used

No theres no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous

The evidence is identical to the sort of evidence that has been
used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases
in the past

medicine on the right road  But methinks that some who hold too firmly
to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough
actually treating patients

I like the implication here  It must not be that the quacks making
millions off such diseases are biased  rather that those who
doubt their existence dont understand the real world  It seems
easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same
thing

However I have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple
quack diseases rise and fall in popularity  Systemic yeast syndome
seems to be making a resurgence it had fallen off a few years ago
There will be new such diseases Im sure with bestselling books
and expensive therapies

If anybody doctors included said to me to my
face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection I cannot guarantee
their safety  For their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as
far as I am concerned

Well this of course is convincing  I guess Id better start diagnosing
any illnesses that people want so that I can keep my lips
