Dyer youre rude Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour Its
often practiced in a disorganized manner Most early treatment of
nonlife threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient Its an educated guess by a trained person
but its still no more than a guess
Its cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who dont respond
 

Dyer is beyond rude 

There have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own 
knowledge and unopen to anything that isnt already established Given what 
the medical community doesnt know Im surprised that he has this outlook

For the record I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
past few years with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
deficiencies I had not taken any antobiotics 

My dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous

After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis the outbreaks ceased
When I quit taking the acidophilous the outbreaks periodically resumed 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then
