If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above
any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing
from you I am not trying to play doctor here but only trying to gather
information about it As I know now these particular types of disorders
are still not really well understood by the medical community and so Im
going to see nowif somehow the internet can at least give me alittle
insight Thanks 


There is no database for infantile spasms nor a newsgroup that I
know of  The medical library will be the best source of information
for you
