lots of editing out of previuos posts

Here is another anecdotal story  I am a picky eater and never wanted to 
try chinese food however I finally tried some in order to please a
girl I was seeing at the time  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant
syndrome  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different
dishes  It didnt taste great but I decided it wasnt so bad  We went
home and went to bed early  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs
I threw up for so long that Im not kidding I pulled a muscle in
my tongue  Dry heaves and everything  No one else got sick and Im
not allergic to anything that I know of  

Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am 
physically threatened  The smell of the food makes me ill and that is
a psycholgical reaction  When I have been dragged in to suffer
through beef and broccoli without any sauces I insist on no MSG  
I havent gotten sick yet

Funny about that my wife my girlfriend at the time used to get sick 
after eating certain foods at various Asian restaurants and never knew 
why  Shed go pale and sweaty and then vomit copiously  A couple of us 
ventured a connection with MSG and her response was MSG  Whats that  
It also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and 
chips which I noticed later had MSG on the label  Dont know about 
double blinds but avoiding MSG has stopped her being sick at restaurants


cheers John
