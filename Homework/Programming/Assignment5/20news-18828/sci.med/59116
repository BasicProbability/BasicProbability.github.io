I recall reading somewhere during my youth in some science popularization
book that whyle isotope changes dont normally affect chemistry a consumption
of only heavy water would be fatal and that seeds watered only with heavy
water do not sprout  Does anyone know about this


I also heard this I always thought it might make a good eposide of
Columbo for someone to be poisoned with heavy water  it wouldnt
show up in any chemical test

That would be a very expensive toxin indeed
