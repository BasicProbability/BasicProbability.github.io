Good grief again

Why the anger  I must have really touched a raw nerve

Lets see  I had symptoms that resisted all other treatments  Sporanox
totally alleviated them within one week  Hmmm I must be psychotic  Yesss
Thats it  my illness was all in my mind  Thanks Steve for your correct
diagnosis  you must have a lot of experience being out there in trenches
treating hundreds of patients a week  Thank you  Im forever in your
debt

Jon

oops gotta run the men in white coats are ready to take me away haha
to the happy home where I can go twiddle my thumbs basket weave and
moan about my sinuses

Ever heard of something called the placebo effect I think Dyer is
reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old
quackery over and over again

It true that current medical knowledge is limited but do you realize
just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your  Its playing the
lottery at best

If the results you got were so clear and obvious would you mind
trying a little experiment to see if it is true It would be quite
simple Have sugar pills and have real pills  Take one set for one
week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
the real pills Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results
Lets say youre wife would know which are the real ones If what you
are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
each week
