 Am I justified in being pissed off at this doctor
 
 Last Saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife
 I took him to a local Urgent and General Care clinic at 550 pm  The

 be bothered  My son did get three stitches at the emergency room  Im still 
 trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so I can write them a 
 letter   We will certainly never set foot in that clinic again
 

The people in charge already know what kind of care they are 
providing and they dont give a rats ass about your repeat business

You are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers
and broadcast news shows  If you do keep the letter short and to the point
so they dont discard it out of hand and emphasize exactly what you
are upset about

Its possible that the local health department can help you complain to 
someone official but really that clinic exists for the sole purpose 
of generating walkin income through advertising and nothing you can do 
will change them  all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid them

Im glad it sounds like your son did ok anyway

My opinion only of course
