Subject Re Krillean Photography

I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school
I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by
first dunking them in water
 
 I know this is a little weird but I know that World magazine you know
National Geo for children did a very simple and concise article on Kirlian
photography  They had some neat pictures too  A friend of mines mother had
a book on Kirlian photography only its photographs took a radiologist to 
interpret  They World magazine warned us all that it was very dangerous
probably to stop curious children from experimenting with it  Mind you this
was 10 years ago at least  And boy does that say something about my age
