Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications 
has been linked to rapidexcessive weight gain andor a distorted 
sense of taste or smell  Hismanal Azmacort a topical steroid to 
prevent asthma Vancenase
 
 Hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain
 It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect
 and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly
 doesnt cross the bloodbrain barrier and so tends not to cause
 drowsiness

It also gave me lots of problems with joint and muscle pain  Seemed to
trigger arthritislike problems
