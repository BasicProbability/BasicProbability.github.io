I would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
Mednews OCRScanner Fund  We have reached our goal  A Hewlett Packard
Scanjet IIp was purchased this week

Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received

John Sorenson
Carol Sigelman
Carla Moore
Barbara Moose
Judith Schrier

Again thank you to all who gave

I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
review the product  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems  
It runs under Windows 31 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett 
Packard Scanners  

When initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options 
1 text  graphics 2 input source ie scanner fax file disk file 3 
automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image 

I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
parts of the document I would like scanned and in what order

Once an image is scanned you can bring up the PopUp image verification  The 
software gives you two errors at this point  Blue which are words that were 
converted reliability but do not match anything in the builtin dictionary  
Yellow shade which are words that Wordscan Plus doesnt think it converted 
correctly at all  I have found that the software should give itself more 
credit  It is usually correct instead of wrong  If a word is shaded blue 
you can add it to your personal dictionary  The only problem is the personal 
dictionary will only handle about 200 words  I find this to be very limited 
considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary 

After a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word 
processor formats  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a 
seperate TIFF or PCX file format

I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files  I use

an Intel Satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a PCXDCX format  
While most of my faxes were received in standard mode 200x100 dpi the 
accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent 

Overall a very impressive product  The only fault I could find is the 
limitations of the size of the user dictionary  200 specialized words is just 
too small 

If anyone has any specific questions please do not hesitate to send me email

                                 Introduction

     Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
soon be eliminated as a public health problem 1 infectious diseases remain 
the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
the United States Since the early 1970s the US public health system has 
been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes eg 
Escherichia coli O157H7 hepatitis C virus human immunodeficiency virus 
Legionnaires disease Lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome The incidences 
of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera 
malaria and tuberculosis TB have increased in many areas Furthermore 
control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease 
salmonellosis shigellosis TB and staphylococcal infections 2 Emerging 
infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those 
in institutional settings eg hospitals and child day care centers and 
minority and underserved populations The substantial economic burden of 
emerging infections on the US healthcare system could be reduced by more 
effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
3 
     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series Emerging Infectious 
Diseases Future articles will address these diseases as well as 
surveillance control and prevention efforts by healthcare providers and 
public health officials This first article updates the ongoing investigation 
of an outbreak of E coli O157H7 in the western United States 4

     From November 15 1992 through February 28 1993 more than 500 
laboratoryconfirmed infections with E coli O157H7 and four associated 
deaths occurred in four states  Washington Idaho California and Nevada 
This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation 1 that 
identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
one restaurant chain Washington 
     On January 13 1993 a physician reported to the Washington Department of 
Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome HUS and an 
increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea During January 1617 a 
casecontrol study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
postdiarrheal HUS identified with age and neighborhoodmatched controls

18 a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants 
was initiated 
     As a result of publicity and casefinding efforts during January
February 1993 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the 
state health department A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case 
definition of cultureconfirmed E coli O157H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS 
Figure 1 Of the 477 persons 52 11 had close contact with a person with 
confirmed E coli O157H7 infection during the week preceding onset of 
symptoms Of the remaining 425 persons 372 88 reported eating in a chain A 
restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms Of the 338 patients 
who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant 312 92 reported eating 
a regularsized hamburger patty Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 
through January 20 Of the 477 casepatients 144 30 were hospitalized 30 
developed HUS and three died The median age of patients was 75 years 
range 074 years Idaho 
     Following the outbreak report from Washington the Division of Health 
Idaho Department of Health and Welfare identified 14 persons with culture
confirmed E coli O157H7 infection with illness onset dates from December 
11 1992 through February 16 1993 Figure 2A Four persons were 
hospitalized one developed HUS During the week preceding illness onset 13

     In late December the San Diego County Department of Health Services was 
notified of a child with E coli O157H7 infection who subsequently died 
Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
E coli O157H7 infections or HUS from midNovember through midJanuary 1993 
Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and

reported reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27 
increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January 
1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier A case was defined as 
postdiarrheal HUS bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured 
or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E coli O157H7 with 
onset from November 15 1992 through January 31 1993 
     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition Figure 2B The 
outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients Fourteen 
persons were hospitalized seven developed HUS and one child died The median

     On January 22 after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten 
at a local chain A restaurant the Clark County Las Vegas Health District 
issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
contact the health department A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS bloody 
diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured or any diarrheal illness 
with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E coli O157H7 with 
onset from December 1 1992 through February 7 1993 Because local 
laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey SMAC medium to screen stools 
for E coli O157H7 this organism was not identified in any patient After 
SMAC medium was distributed the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
one patient 38 days after illness onset

498 Other Investigation Findings 
     During the outbreak chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases 
primarily were serving regularsized hamburger patties produced on November 
19 1992 some of the same meat was used in jumbo patties produced on 
November 20 1992 The outbreak strain of E coli O157H7 was isolated from 11 
lots of patties produced on those two dates these lots had been distributed 
to restaurants in all states where illness occurred Approximately 272672 
20 of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall 
     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the 
United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the

contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
the likelihood of contamination The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states No one 
slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source 
     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
families and child day care settings is ongoing

Editorial Note E coli O157H7 is a pathogenic gramnegative bacterium first 
identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody 
diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers 2 This pathogen has since 
emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS the most common 
cause of acute renal failure in children Outbreak investigations have linked 
most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other 
food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been 
implicated 3 Preliminary data from a CDC 2year nationwide multicenter 
study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E coli O157H7 
that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 
participating hospitals and was isolated from 78 of all bloody stools a 
higher rate than for any other pathogen 
     Infection with E coli O157H7 often is not recognized because most 
clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on

SMAC medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
associated with infection 4 The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent Younger age groups 
and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
complications Illness usually resolves after 68 days but 27 of patients 
develop HUS which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia 
renal failure and a death rate of 35 
     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
outbreaks of E coli O157H7 in the absence of routine surveillance Despite 
the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in 
three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington 
1 Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E coli O157H7 using SMAC agar 5 
When infections with E coli O157H7 are identified they should be reported 
to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public 
health action to prevent further cases 
     E coli O157H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can 
contaminate meat during slaughter CDC is collaborating with the US 
Department of Agricultures Food Safety Inspection Service to identify 
critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
the likelihood of pathogens such as E coli O157H7 entering the meat supply 
Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be 
internally contaminated The optimal food protection practice is to cook 
ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices 
are clear In this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
an important role The Food and Drug Administration FDA has issued interim 
recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
155 F 861 C FDA personal communication 1993 
     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
outbreaks The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
caused by E coli O157H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E 
coli O157H7

     Consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
United States almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 1 Longterm use of 
smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
oral cancer 2  the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently 1 
To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products 
CDCs 1991 National Health Interview SurveyHealth Promotion and Disease 
Prevention supplement NHISHPDP collected information on snuff and chewing 
tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the US civilian 
noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years This 
report summarizes findings from this survey 
     The 1991 NHISHPDP supplement asked Have you used snuff at least 20 
times in your entire life and Do you use snuff now Similar questions were 
asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking Current users of 
smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
time of the interview former users were defined as those who reported having 
used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the 
time of the interview Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
former users Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not 
smoking now Ever smokers included current and former smokers Data on 
smokeless tobacco use were available for 43732 persons aged greater than or 
equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
national estimates Confidence intervals CIs were calculated by using 
standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis SUDAAN

     In 1991 an estimated 53 million 29 US adults were current users 
of smokeless tobacco including 48 million 56 men and 533000 06 
women For all categories of comparison the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use was substantially higher among men For men the prevalence of use was 
highest among those aged 1824 years Table 1 for women the prevalence was 
highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years The prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American IndiansAlaskan 
Natives and whites the prevalence among women was highest among American 
IndiansAlaskan Natives and blacks Among both men and women prevalence of 
smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education Prevalence was 
substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in 
rural areas Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among

for women p less than 005 Table 1 
     Among men the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those 
aged 1844 years but varied considerably by age the prevalence of use of 
chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group Table 2 Although 
women rarely used smokeless tobacco the prevalence of snuff use was highest 
among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years 
     An estimated 79 million 44 95 CI4146 adults reported being 
former smokeless tobacco users Among ever users the proportion who were 
former smokeless tobacco users was 599 95 CI577621 Among persons

Editorial Note The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
tobacco was highest among young males Adolescent and young adult males in 
particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility Use of oral 
snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this 
behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders 4 
     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
racialethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
further explanation For example targeted marketing practices may play a role 
in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the 
differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons 56 
     In this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes In the 1991 NHISHPDP the 
prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users In a previous 
study among college students 18 of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

occasionally 7 In addition approximately 7 of adults who formerly smoked 
reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
stop smoking 8 Healthcare providers should recognize the potential health 
implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use 
     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special 
population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
tobacco use including males aged 1224 years to no more than 4 by the year 
2000 objective 39 and American IndianAlaskan Native youth to no more 
than 10 by the year 2000 objective 39a 9 Strategies to lower the 
prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobaccocontrol efforts 
enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco making excise taxes 
commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging healthcare providers to 
routinely provide cessation advice and followup providing schoolbased 
prevention and cessation interventions and adopting policies that prohibit 
tobacco use on school property and at schoolsponsored events 5
