                    LOW LEVELS OF AIRBORNE PARTICLES LINKED
                           TO SERIOUS ASTHMA ATTACKS
                           American Lung Association 

     A new study published by the American Lung Association has shown that 
surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with 
asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment  
     The Seattlebased study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits 
for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution  
The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed 
unsafe under federal air quality laws  
     People with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to 
exacerbate that inflammation said Joel Schwartz PhD of the Environmental 
Protection Agency who was the lead author of the study  When people are on 
the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over 
the edge 
     The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits 
with daily levels of PM or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
of 10 microns or less  These finer particles are considered hazardous because 
they are small enough penetrate into the lung  Cities are considered out of 
compliance with clean air laws if the 24hour average concentration of PM10 
exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air  
     In Seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at 
levels as low as 30 micrograms  The authors concluded that for every 30 
microgram increase in the fourday average of PM10 the odds of someone with 
asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent  
     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory 
Disease an official journal of the American Thoracic Society the Lung 
Associations medical section  
     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that 
particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat  A 1992 study 
by Dr Schwartz and Douglas Dockery PhD of Harvard found that particles 
may be causing roughly 60000 premature deaths each year in the United States  
Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms 
and bronchitis in children  
     Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone 
says Dr Schwartz  But more and more research is showing that particles are 
bad actors as well      One problem in setting standards for particulate 
air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study  Unlike other regulated 
pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex 
and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and

acid aerosols  
     Researchers cant Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects 
of particulate air pollution says Dr Schwartz  We have no way of 
duplicating the typical urban mix of particles   Consequently most of what 
is known about particulates has been learned through populationbased research 
like the Seattle study  
     Given that the EPAs current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur 
dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any 
time soon  Until changes are made there appears to be little people with 
asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles
     In some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only 
cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and thats 
rarely particulate matter says Dr  Schwartz  However PM10 doesnt have 
to be near its violation range to be unhealthy

               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma

The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in 
dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance 
techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care 
professionals and the public to address 1 the clinical and histological 
characteristics of early melanoma 2 the appropriate diagnosis management 
and followup of patients with early melanoma 3 the role of dysplastic nevi 
and their significance and 4 the role of education and screening in 
preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality  Following 2 days of 
presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel 
weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement 
 
Among their findings the panel recommended that 1 melanoma in situ is a 
distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 05 centimeter margins 
2 thin invasive melanoma less than 1 millimeter thick has the potential 
for longterm survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical 
excision with a 1 centimeter margin 3 elective lymph node dissections and 
extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma 4 
patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high 
risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely 
5 some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for 
melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs and 6 education 
and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality 
from melanoma

                         NCIDesignated Cancer Centers

The Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCIdesignated Cancer Centers 
actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer 
incidence morbidity and mortality  Within the program there are four types 
of cancer centers  basic science cancer centers 14 which engage primarily 
in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers 12 which focus on 
clinical research comprehensive cancer centers 28 which emphasize a 
multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community 
outreach and consortium cancer centers 1 which specialize in cancer 
prevention and control research 
 
Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s it was 
the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new 
cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones  The passage 
of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened 
the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and 
cancer control research  Over the next two decades the centers program grew 
progressively 
 
In 1990 there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation Today 
there are 28 of these institutions all of which meet specific NCI criteria 
for comprehensive status 
 
To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center an 
institution must pass rigorous peer review  Under guidelines newly 
established in 1990 the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the 
requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in 
several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong 
program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings 
into clinical practice 
 
Moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly 
beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant also 
referred to as a P30 or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting 
the infrastructure of a cancer centers operations  These criteria encompass 
strong participation in NCIdesignated highpriority clinical trials 
significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important 
outreach and educational activitiesall of which are funded by a variety of 
sources 
 
The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and 
capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit 
important new findings or address timely research questions

Of the 55 NCIdesignated Cancer Centers 14 are of the basic science type  
These centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers 
engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators 
and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications 
from new discoveries in the laboratory 
 
Clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and 
clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently 
incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their 
overall research programs  There are 12 such centers today 
 
Finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely 
structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and 
control research  These centers interface with state and local public health 
departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention 
and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions 
responsible for implementing populationwide public health programs  
Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with 
institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community 
hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials 
 
Together the 55 NCIDesignated Cancer Centers continue to work toward 
creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through 
interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the 
laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice

NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines Reuters 040893  Frank 
Jacqueline 

     WashingtonThe Clinton administration will permit the National  
Institutes of Health to test multiple AIDS vaccines instead of  only allowing 
the Army to test a single vaccine administration  sources said Thursday  The 
decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to 
test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc and the National Institutes of 
Health which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested  Health and  
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the 
therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday  Companies 
including Genentech Inc Chiron Corp and  Immuno AG have already told NIH 
that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests  The testing is 
intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  
replication of HIV in patients already infected  Shalala refuted last weeks 
reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Armys test of the 
MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time  
The report was inaccurate  and I expect there to be some announcement in the 
next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project said Shalala   
Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr Bernadine 
Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had 
convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested 
simultaneously  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of 
multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two 
years

The Limits of AZTs Impact on HIV US News  World Report 041293 Vol 
114 No 14 P 18 

     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987   Burroughs Wellcome 
the manufacturer of AZT made 338 million  last year alone from sales of the 
drug  However a team of  European researchers recently reported that 
although HIVpositive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk 
of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment that benefit  
disappeared two years later  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of 
the threeyear study which could give more reason  for critics to argue the 
drugs cost side effects and general  efficacy  Even though US 
researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials 
many argue the European  researchers suggestion that HIVpositive patients 
experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  
AIDS symptoms  In addition researchers have long been familiar  with the 
 end of part 3
