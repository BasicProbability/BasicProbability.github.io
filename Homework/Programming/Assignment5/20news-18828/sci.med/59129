Ill drink to that

Yeah yeah yeah  I didnt threaten to rip your lips off did I
Snort

There have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own 
knowledge and unopen to anything that isnt already established Given what 
the medical community doesnt know Im surprised that he has this outlook

Duh

Nice to see Steve still has his high and almighty intellectual prowess 
in tact

For the record I have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
past few years with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
deficiencies I had not taken any antobiotics 

Listen thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics  If you have thrush you have thrush because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it it generally
responds well if youre not otherwise immunocompromised  Norings
analretentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have candida from reading a quack book

Yawn

My dentist who sees a fair amount of thrush recommended acidophilous
After I began taking acidophilous on a daily basis the outbreaks ceased
When I quit taking the acidophilous the outbreaks periodically resumed 
I resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then

So

Exactly my question to you Steve Whats your point This person had
one you didnt

Nice to see that some things never change Steve if you arent being
ignorant in one group alternative youre into another One positive
thing came out of it you are no longer bothering the folks in 
alternative its just a shame that these people have to suffer so
that others may breath freely 
 
Sorry for wasting bandwidth folks Dont forget to bow down once
every second day and to offer your first born to the almight 
omniscient omnipotent Mr Steve
