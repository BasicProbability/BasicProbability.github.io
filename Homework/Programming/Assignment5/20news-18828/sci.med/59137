Medicine is not a totally scientific endevour
 
The acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific  The
application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than
science
 
There are diseases that havent been described yet and the root cause
of many diseases now described arent known Read a book on
gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them After
scientific methods have run out then its the patients freedom of
choice to try any experimental method they choose And its well
recognized by many doctors that medicine doesnt have all the answers
 
Certainly we dont have all the answers  The question is what is the
most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge  The
scientific method has proven itself to be reliable  The only reason
alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their
practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific
scrutiny insisting that tradition or anecdotal evidence are
sufficient  These have been shown many times in the past to be very
unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge  Crooks ideas have
never been backed up by scientific evidence  His unwillingness to do
good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions
