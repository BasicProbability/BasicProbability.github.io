Can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications 
has been linked to rapidexcessive weight gain andor a distorted 
sense of taste or smell  Hismanal Azmacort a topical steroid to 
prevent asthma Vancenase

Hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain
It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect
and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly
doesnt cross the bloodbrain barrier and so tends not to cause
drowsiness


So antihistamines can cause weight gain  NOW they tell me 
Is there any way to find out which do  which dont  My doctor
obviously is asleep at the wheel

The original poster mentioned fatigue  I had that too but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having  I wasnt getting
any rest  My doctor said that was a common reaction  If astemizole
doesnt cross the bloodbrain barrier how does it cause that side
effect  Any ideas
