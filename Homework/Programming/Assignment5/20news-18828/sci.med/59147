Subject Re Discussions on altpsychoactives

In article 1r4bhsINNhafhpcolcolhpcom billccolhpcom Bill Claussen writes

This group was originally a takeoff from scimed  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugssuch as 

Oh well obviously no one really cares


	Then let me ask you for a workable solution  We have a name
here that implies certain things to many people  Rather than trying
to educate each and every person that comes to the group  is there
some name that would imply what this group was originally
intended for  

	My dad was a lawyer  as such I grew up with being a stickler
for meaning  In my reality psychoactives technically could 
range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
standard recreational drugs  In practice I had hoped to see it
limited to those that were above some psychoactive level  like
some of the drugs you mention but also possibly including some
recreational drugs  but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
effects  the recent query about bong water I thought was a bit
off topic  so I just hit k

	But back to the original question  what is a workable solution 
what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
discuss  It sounds like there should be a altsmartdrugs or something
similar  I dont feel psychoactives would generally be used to
describe alot of those drugs  There is a big difference between a
drug that if taken in certain doses over a period of days may have
a psychoactive effect in some people vs many of the drugs in
PIHKAH which are psychoactive
