   someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture
   needles

Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who   
themselves has AIDSit is unlikely not impossible they will get AIDS        
from acupuncture needles Generally even if accidently inoculated the normal
immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant 
involved with acupuncture needle insertion 

Isnt this what HIV is about  the normal immune response to an exposure

Most acupuncturists use disposable needlesuse once and throw away

I had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back  The needles were taken
from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly NOT
sterile or even clean for that matter  More than likely they were fresh
from the previous patient  I WAS concerned but I kept my mouth shut  I
probably should have raised hell

Any comments  No excuses
