    The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made
    by Kellogs makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to
    something in the coating or the cereals  Of the four of us in our
    immediate family Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever running
    nose itchy eyes etc but we have a lot of allergies in our family history
    including some weird food allergies  nuts mushrooms 
    

   Many of these cereals are cornbased After your post I looked in the
   literature and located two articles that implicated corn contains
   tryptophan and seizures The idea is that corn in the diet might
   potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder not cause it
   Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based Id be interested

A couple of folks have suggested the corn connection  In the five month
period between the two seizures my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
Kix and Berry Berry Kix in the mornings and never had a problem  I checked
the labels and the first ingredient is corn  She has also never had a problem
eating corn or corn on the cob but of course that is usually later in the day
with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high  I do believe that
Frost Flakes have corn in them but I will have to check the Fruit Loops  But
the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
wonder

Thanks for checking into this  All information at this point is valuable to me
