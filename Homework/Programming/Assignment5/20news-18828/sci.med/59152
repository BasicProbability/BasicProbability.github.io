 Now Im not saying that culturing is the best way to diagnose its very
 hard to culture Bb in most cases  The point is that Dr N has developed a
 feel for what is and what isnt LD  This comes from years of experience
 No serology can match that  Unfortunately some would call Dr N a quack
 and accuse him of trying to make a quick buck
 
 Why do you think he would be called a quack  The quacks dont do cultures
 They poopoo doing more lab tests  this is Lyme believe me Ive
 seen it many times  The lab tests arent accurate  Well treat it
 now  Also is Dr Ns practice almost exclusively devoted to treating
 Lyme patients  I dont know any orthopedic surgeons who fit this
 pattern  They are usually GPs

No he does not exclusively treat LD patients  However in some parts of the
country you dont need to be known as an LD specialist to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices  Dr N told me that last year
he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town

Lets say that only 2 people per week actually have LD  That means at the
very minimum 104 people in our town and immediate area develop late stage
manifestations of LD every year  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists rheumatologists GPs etc and you can see what kind of problem
we have  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient

He refers most patients to LD specialists but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage in most cases to
the knees

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs
