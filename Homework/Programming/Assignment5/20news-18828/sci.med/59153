Hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain
It really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect
and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly
doesnt cross the bloodbrain barrier and so tends not to cause
drowsiness

The original poster mentioned fatigue  I had that too but it was
mostly due to the really bizarre dreams I was having  I wasnt getting
any rest  My doctor said that was a common reaction  If astemizole
doesnt cross the bloodbrain barrier how does it cause that side
effect  Any ideas

It made me really BITCHY for the first few weeks  Now that I think about
it I was having some bizarre dreams too  My doctor said it made him feel
like he had to be DOING something all the time  But if you keep taking it
after a few weeks these symptoms seem to go away he said hang in there  
I did and they did
