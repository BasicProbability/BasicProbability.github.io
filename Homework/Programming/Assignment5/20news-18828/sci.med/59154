                      TUTORIAL PROGRAM
Tutorials will be conducted at the Bethesda Ramada Hotel on 
Tuesday July 6

1200245pm Introduction to Molecular Biology for Computer 
 Scientists  Prof Mick Noordewier Rutgers University

This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain  
Material covered will include structural and informational 
molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
material the central dogma of gene expression and selected 
other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as 
relates to current computational approaches  Dr Noordewier has 
appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers and 
has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
to his current work in computational biology

1200245pm Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for 
 Biologists  Dr Richard Lathrop MIT  Arris Corp

An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
presented as it relates to actual and potential biological 
applications  Fundamental techniques symbolic programming 
languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as 
selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge 
representation inference and machine learning  The intended 
audience includes biologists with some computational background 
but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence  Dr 
Lathrop codeveloper of ARIADNE and related technologies has 
worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
biological problems in both academia and industry

300545pm Neural Networks Statistics and Information Theory 
 in Biological Sequence Analysis Dr Alan Lapedes Los Alamos 
 National Laboratory 

This tutorial will cover the most rapidlyexpanding facet of 
intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine 
learning techniques applied to sequence analysis  Closely 
interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such 
approaches to statistical techniques and informationtheoretic 
views of sequence data  Dr Lapedes of the Theoretical 
Division at Los Alamos has long been a leader in the use of such 
techniques in this domain

300545pm Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming 
 Prof John Koza Stanford University

The genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly 
nonlinear multidimensional optimization problems was originally 
inspired by a biological metaphor  This tutorial will cover both 
the biological motivations and the actual implementation and 
characteristics of the algorithm  Genetic Programming an 
extension wellsuited to problems where the discovery of the size 
and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will 
also be addressed  Particular attention will be paid to 
biological applications and to identifying resources and software 
that will permit attendees to begin using the methods  Dr Koza 
a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford has taught 
this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
the field

300545pm Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis 
 Prof David Searls University of Pennsylvania 
  Shmuel Pietrokovski Weizmann Institute

Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
are increasingly in evidence  These involve the adaptation of 
tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of 
genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the 
identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
functional relatedness  Dr Searls who holds research faculty 
appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn 
represents the branch of this field that considers higherorder 
syntactic approaches to sequence data while Shmuel Pietrokovski 
has studied and published with Prof Edward Trifinov in the area 
of wordbased analyses
