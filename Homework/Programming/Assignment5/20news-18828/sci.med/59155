A friend of mine is seeing an acupuncturist and
wants to know if there is any danger of getting
AIDS from the needles

	Ask the practitioner whether he uses the presterilized disposable
needles or if he reuses needles sterilizing them between use  In the
former case theres no conceivable way to get AIDS from the needles  In
the latter case its highly unlikely though many practitioners use the
disposable variety anyway

It is illegal to perform acupuncture with unsterilized needles No licensed
practitioner would dare do this Also there is not a single documented case
of transmission of AIDS via acupuncture needles I wouldnt worry about it
