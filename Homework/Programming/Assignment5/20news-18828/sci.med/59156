Subject diet for Crohns IBD


A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohns
disease

But she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence

Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
problems of people with Crohns disease 

I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric

Thanks in advance
