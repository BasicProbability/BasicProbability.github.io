Can you provide a reference to substantiate that gaining back
the lost weight does not constitute weight rebound until it
exceeds the starting weight  Or is this oral tradition that
is shared only among you obesity researchers

Annals of NY Acad Sci 1987

Hmmm These dont look like references to me Is passiveaggressive
behavior associated with weight rebound 

I purposefully left off the page numbers to encourage the reader to
study the volumes mentioned and benefit therefrom


Good story Chuck but it wont wash  I have read the NY Acad Sci
one and have it  This AM I couldnt find any reference to
weight rebound  Im not saying it isnt there but since you
cited it it is your responsibility to show me where it is in there
There is no index  I suspect you overstepped your knowledge base
as usual
