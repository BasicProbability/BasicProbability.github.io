 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohns
 disease
 
 But she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
 without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence
 
 Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with Crohns disease 
 
 I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric
 
 Thanks in advance

If she is having problems with fresh vegetables the guess is that there
is some obstruction of the intestine  Without knowing more it is not
possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring
or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine  In general there are
no dietary limitations in patients with Crohns except as they relate
to obstruction  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on 
recurrence of Crohns  It is important to distinguish recurrence from
recurrent symptoms  A physician would think of new inflammation as 
recurrence while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the
intestine  

Your friend should look into membership in the Crohns and Colitis

Good luck to your friend
