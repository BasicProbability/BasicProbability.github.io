 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohns
 disease
 
 But she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
 without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence
 
 Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with Crohns disease 

If she is having problems with fresh vegetables the guess is that there
is some obstruction of the intestine  Without knowing more it is not
possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring
or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine  In general there are
no dietary limitations in patients with Crohns except as they relate
to obstruction  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on 
recurrence of Crohns 

Interesting statements simply because I have been told otherwise  Im
certainly not questioning Steves claims as for one I am not a doctor and I
agree that foods dont bring on the recurrence of Crohns  But inflammation
can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food

Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection is that a good enough
caveat  I was told that a LOW RESIDUE diet is called for  Basically
the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut which may not be
realized by the patient any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
of inflammation and constantly irritate thus exacerbating the problem
Therefore anything that doesnt digest completely by the point of common
inflammation should be avoided  With what Ive been told is typical Crohns
of the terminal ileum my diet should be low residue consisting of

Completely out  never again  items
	o corn kernel husk doesnt digest  most of us know this 
	o popcorn same
	o dried dehydrated fruit and fruit skins
	o nuts Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge 

Discouraged greatly
	o raw vegetables too fibrous
	o wheat and raw grain breads
	o exotic lettuce iceberg is ok since its apparently mostly water
	o greens turnip mustard kale etc
	o little seeds like sesame try getting an Arbys without it
	o long grain and wild rice husky
	o beans youll generate enough gas alone without them
	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing

I was told that the more processed the food the better rather ironic in this
day and age  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE  you want to give your
system as little chance to inflame as possible  I was told that among the
NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged I only listed a few to try
the ones I wanted and see how I felt  If its bad dont do it again
Remember though that this was while I was in remission  For Veggies cook the
daylights out of them  I prefer steaming  I think its cooks more
thoroughly  youre mileage may vary

As with anything else CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR  Dont just take my word  But
this is the info Ive been given and it may be a starting point for
discussion  Good luck
