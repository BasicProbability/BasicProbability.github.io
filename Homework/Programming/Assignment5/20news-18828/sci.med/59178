Subject Re Altitude adjustment

I live at sealevel and am calledupon to travel to highaltitude cities
quite frequently on business  The cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
feet of altitude  One of them especially is very polluted

Often I feel faint the first two or three days  I feel lightheaded and
my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sealevel  Also it is very
dry in these cities so I will tend to drink a lot of water and keep
away from dehydrating drinks such as those containing caffeine or alcohol

Thing is I still have symptoms  How can I ensure that my short trips there
no I dont usually have a week to acclimatize are as comfortable as possible
Is there something else that I could do

I saw a Lifetime Medical Television show a few months back on travel
medicine  It briefly mentioned some drugs which when started two or
three days before getting to altitude could assist in acclimitazation

Unfortunately all that I can recall is that the drug stimulated
breathing at night  I dont know if that makes sense it seems
to me that the new drug which stimulates red blood cell production
would be a more logical approach erythropoiten sp

Alas I didnt record the program but wish I had since I live
at over 7000ft and my mother gets sick when visiting

Please let me know if you get more informative responses
