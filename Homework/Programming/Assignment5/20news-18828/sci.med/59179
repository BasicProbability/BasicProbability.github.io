Snort  Ah there go my sinuses again
Oh wow  A classic textbook  Hey they laughed at Einstein too
Yeah Ill bet  Tomorrow the world
Listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless
Im sure you are  You sound like the typical hysterichypochondriac who
responds to miracle cures
Yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously
Snort
Yeah it sounds reasonable to me
Oh really  What tests  Immunecompromised my ass
More like credulous malingerer  This is a psychiatric syndrome
You know its a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused
in this way  Its ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic
The trouble is that it isnt toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks
The only good thing about nystatin is that its relatively cheap
and when taken orally nontoxic  But oral nystatin is without any
systemic effect so unless it were given IV it would be without
any effect on your sinuses  I wish these quacks would first use
IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you  That would solve
the yeast problem once and for all
Perhaps a little Haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating
your symptoms
Are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket  Id hate
to think my insurance premiums are going towards this

Steve take a look at what you are saying  I dont see one construvtive
word here  If you dont have anything constructive to add why waste
the bandwidth  yeah sure flame me for doing it myself  Is this
scimed or altflame  Like it or not medical science does not know
categorically everything about everything  Im not flaming your
knowledge just asking you to sit back and ask yourself what if

Minds are like parachutes  they only function when they are open

Oh  and if you do want to flame me or anyone else how about using
email

Rob Geraghty                3 things are important to me 
robgcitruqozau          The gift of love the joy of life
CITR                        And the making of music in all its forms
