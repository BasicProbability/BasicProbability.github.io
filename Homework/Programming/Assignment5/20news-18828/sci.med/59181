Subject Re diet for Crohns IBD

In article 1r6g8fINNe88ceticsuncedu jgecsuncedu John Eyles writes
 
 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohns
 disease
 
 But she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
 without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence
 
 Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with Crohns disease 
 
 I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric
 
 Thanks in advance

All your friend really has to do is find a Registered DieticianRD  While 
most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have RDs who 
are in private practice so to speak  Many physicans will refer their 
patients with Crohns disease to RDs for dietary help  If you can get 
your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for 
the RDs services just like the services of a physical therapist  The 
better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends 
plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to 
control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
Crohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and 
lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but 
Im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  For 
bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects 
are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  Upjohn is developing 
a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with 
inflammatory diseases but its not available yet
