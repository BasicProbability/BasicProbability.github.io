Subject Great Post was Re Candida yeast Bloom VERY LONG


GREAT post Martin  Very informative wellbalanced and humanitarian
without neglecting the need for scientific rigor


Crossposted to altpsychologypersonality since some personality typing
will be discussed at the beginning  Note Ive set all followups to scimed
since most of my comments are more scimed oriented and Im sure most of the
replies if any will be medrelated

I can not believe the way this thread on candidayeast has progressed
Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci 
Med Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman 
poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well  

They are just responding in their natural way  HyperCholeric Syndrome HCS
Oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community
better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist  

Actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
will type out as NT for those not familiar with the MyersBriggs system
just email me and Ill send a summary file to you  In the general
population NTs comprise only about 12 of the population but among
physicians it is much much higher I dont know the exact percentage 
any help here appers

One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious
choleric behavior driver type A etc  the extreme emotional need to
control to lead andor to be the best or the most competent  If they are
also extroverted they are best described as Field Marshalls  This trait
is very valuable and essential in our society  we need people who want to
lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge
to raise the level of competency etc  The great successes in science and
technology are in large part due to the vision an N trait and scientifically
minded approach T trait of the NT personality of course the other types
and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well  However
when the NT person has selfimage challenges the darkside of this
personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all

A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their
temperament will be extremely businesslike lack of empathy or feeling
and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient
must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question  Ive
known many MDs of this temperament and suffice to say I dont oblige them
with a followup visit no matter how competent I think they are and they
usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
extreme drive of theirs  to know the most to know it all

Maybe we need more NF doctors  

Enough on this subject  lets move on to candida bloom


Let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have 
no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that 
balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics  Could it just be
professional jealousy  I couldnt help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did

Youve helped me already by your post  Of course I believe that I have
been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being
the phlegmatic I am maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people
myself in past posts  Lets all try to raise the level of this discussion
above the level of anal effluent


Humans have all 
kinds of different organisms living in the GI system mouth stomach small 
and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin  These are 
nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune 
system is compromised  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike 
the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce 
toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body  But any of 
these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up 
residence within the body  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this 
happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier

In my welldescribed situation in prior posts I definitely was immune
stressed  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low  My sinuses
were a mess  no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged
I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years  In the end even two weeks
of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
infection of the sinuses via catscans mucus color wont get into the
details and other symptoms  Three very traditional ENTs made this
diagnosis I did not have any cultures done however because of the
difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
a bacterial infection  Enough of this background provided to help you
understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox antifungal
therapy below


The first question I have is this  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being
considered systemic in the classic sense  It is sort of an inbetween
infection


Steve got real upset with Elaines doctor because he was using antifungals 
and vitamin A for her GI problems  If Steve really understoood what 
vitamin A does in the body he would notor at least should not be calling 
Elaines doctor a quack

I was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin A  My doctor after
my blood tests put me on 75000 IU of vitamin A for one week only then
dropped it down to 25000 IU for the next couple of weeks  I also received
zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly
complex ways as my doctor explained hes one of those evil orthomolecular
specialists  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal
he then stopped me on all vitamin A except for some in a multivitamin
supplement and made sure that I maintain a 50000 IUday of beta carotene
Call me carrot face  

Hopefully Elaines doctor will take a similar careful approach and to
all supplements  Im even reevaluating some supplements Im taking for
example niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gramday which Steve Dyer had
good information about on scimednutrition  If niacin only has secondorder
improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is
not worth taking such a large dose longterm and risking liver damage


survives  If it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides 
the other organisms living with it in the sinuses GI tract or vagina  In 

Though I do now believe based on my successful therapy with Sporanox that
I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my
sinuses I still want to ask the question  have there been any studies that
demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
sinusitisrhinitis  My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
time  I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on
Sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away  considered
normal

BTW my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry cant
remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950s
which stated that people can develop contained nonlethal or nonserious
aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus
inflammation symptoms  Ill have to dig out that reference again since it
is relevant to this discussion


some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
membrane or skin bloom site  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
the candida or not isnt certain

My doctor tested me I believe a RAST or RAST similar test for allergic
response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive
Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless  And assuming it is true that Candida can grow
partway into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a 
threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane
irritation due to the bodys allergic response  As I said in an earlier post
one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a MD degree or a 
PhD in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis

BTW and Ill repost this again  Dr Ivker in his book Sinus Survival
has routinely given before anything else Nizoral a preSporanox systemic
antifungal not as safe and not as good as Sporanox to his new chronic
sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
the last two years  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients well over
90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it
doesnt cure it by any means implying the socalled yeastfungus infection
is not the primary cause but a later complication  Hes also found that
nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help

This implies of course assuming that excessive yeastfungus bloom is
aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeastfungus has grown partway
into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeastfungus other than by
direct contact  it is not absorbed into the blood stream  Again I admit
lots of ifs and implies which doesnt please the hardcore NT who
has to have the doubleblind study or its a nonissue but one has to start
with some plausible hypothesisexplanation a strawman if you will


If its internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
nondescript  

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the
appropriate studies are done  And that is if you cant observe or culture
the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then theres no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body

Its a real Catch22

Another Catch22  Those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that
no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if its not
up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a nonstudy which
should not even be considered  I agree that the appropriate studies should
be done and that will take big  to do it right  However in order to
convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets
you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to
compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
needed funding  That is you have to do 90 of the study before you even get
funding as a scientist at a National Lab Im very aware of this for the
smaller funded projects  Im afraid that even if Dr Ivker and 100 other
doctors got together pooled their practices case histories and anecdotes
into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get
nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results

It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
noticeable nonlethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable
hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would
also oppose the needed studies because in their minds its a done issue  
excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will
not and cannot exist  Period  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold
such a viewpoint  Kind of reminds me of Lister


Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in 
the sinuses the GI tractmouth stomach and intestines and in the 
vaginal tract which compete with it for food  The human immune system 
ususally does not bother itself with thesenonpathogenic organisms unless 
they broach the mucus membrane barrier  If they do an inflammatory 
response will be set up  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A 
from their diets  About 30 of all Americans die with less Vitamin A than 
they were born withUS autopsy studies  While this low level of vitamin 
A does not cause pathologyblindness it does impair the mucus membrane 
barrier system  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong 
inflammatory response after a candida bloom  

Arent there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the
sinus mucus membranes and cilia


While diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the  most common cause of 
this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which 
knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main 
competition for candida as far as food is concerned  While drugs are 
available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not 
use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection  The toxicity of 
the antifungal drugs does warrant some caution  But if the GI or sinus 
inflammation is suspected to be candidaand recent use of a broad spectrum 
antibiotic is the smoking gun then antifungal use should be approrpriate 
just as the antifungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring 
vaginal yeast infections in spite of what Mr Steve Dyer says

Again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeastfungus
species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing
in bread  You can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but
you cant kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
antifungal such as itraconazole Sporanox or some of the older ones such
as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective  This is why as has
been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor Ive been in
email contact with  thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long
term treatment of GI tract candidiasis  Its like trying to weed a garden
by cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
out again once you walk away

The 60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially
grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms
in susceptible people eg allergy without becoming systemic in the
classical sense of the word  something in between strictly an excessive
bloom not causing any problems and the fullblown systemic infection that
is potentially lethal


In the GI system the anorectal region seems to be a particularly good 
reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very 
favorable environment around the rectum for transferthrough moisture and 
humidity of candida to the vaginal tract  One of the most effctive ways to 
minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear  

Also if one is an anal retentive like Ive been diagnosed in a prior
post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth  


If the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even 
blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids  If the 
bloom manages to move further up the GI tract very diffuse symptomatology 
occursabdominal discomfort and blood in the stool  This positive stool 
for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first 
place  After extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong 
but her gut still hurt  On to another doctor and so on  Richard Kaplan 
has told me throiugh email that he considers occult blood tests in stool 
specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of 
false positivescandida blooms guys  If my gut hurt me on a constant 
basis I would want it fixed  Yes its nice to know that I dont have 
colon cancer but what then is causing my distress  When I finally find a 
doctor who treats me and gets me 90 better Steve Dyer calls him a quack

As Ive said in private email there are flaws in our current medical system
that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
alternative therapies AFTER the approvedprovenaccepted therapies dont work
For example I went to three ENTs who all said that I will just have to live
with my acutechronic sinusitis after the abs failed they did mention
surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia werent plugged and it would not
get to the root cause of my condition  After three months of aggressive and
fairly nonstandard therapy Sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and
equalization vitamin C lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly
improved to where I was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated
Of course skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have
improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
experience of the three ENTs I saw who said that Id just have to live with
it  Im confident I will reach what one could call a total cure  The
antifungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction
because of my overuse of abs for the last four years  Note  for those
having sinus problems may I suggest the book by Dr Ivker I mention above
Be sure to get the revised edition


I have often wondered what an MD with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a nonexistent syndrome

Dr Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his
visits to several ENTs totally floored him when they said youll just have
to live with it  He spent several years trying everything  standard and
nonstandard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis  He now
shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road
to recovery following some parts of it  His one recommendation to take a
systemic antifungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of
antibiotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
practice  Im sure if I commented to him of the hardcore beliefs of the anti
yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as
its worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly
I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
their moral obligations to help the patient

Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical
yeast overgrowth eg they fit some of the profiles the proyeast people
have identified should consider antifungal therapy IF all other avenues
have been exhausted  Remember theory and practice are two different things 
you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic  If a doctor does
something nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
thousand of his patients shouldnt you at least sit up and take notice
Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
instead of why it shouldnt work  Im afraid a lot of doctors have become
so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients
they have sworn to help  You have to do both  both have to be balanced which
we dont see from some of the posters to this group  There comes a point when
you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach
such as trying a good systemic antifungal such as Sporanox after having
exhausted all the other avenues  I was one of those who the traditional
medical establishment was not able to help so I did the natural thing  I
went to a couple of doctors who are somewhat outside this establishment
and as a result I have found significant relief

Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having
his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt
therapies for hisher patients that finally reach the point where all the
accepted therapies are ineffective  Id like to hear a doctor tell me
well Ive tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
country and since they clearly dont work for you I now have the authority
to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others  I
cant promise anything and there are some risks  You will have to sign
something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
these unproven therapies and Ill have to register your case at the State
Board  Anyway if my ENT had suggested this to me I wouldve jumped on this
pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic
reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much
risk to himher risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the
patient  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine
and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free  It also would
be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
compassion of the medical community to the patient  that its doing everything
it can within reason to help the patient  It is the lack of such a mechanism
that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of
which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all
true quackery

I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size


If taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut  Through 
aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes
But before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system 
needs to be strengthened  This is accomplished by vitamin A vitamin C and 
some of the Bcomplex vitamins  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans 
are not getting enough B6 and folate  These are probably the segement of 
the population that will have the greatest problem with this nonexistent 
disordercandida blooms after antibiotic therapy

What dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper
working of the mucos memebranes


Some of the above material was obtained from Natural Healing by Mark 
Bricklin Published by Rodale press as well as notes from my human 
nutrition course  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in 
the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely 
important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in 
the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida 
blooms  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate 
intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the GI 
system is involved  If candida can not get glucose its not going to out 
grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and 
fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check 
once carbohydrate is returned to the gut

Id like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch


If Steve and some of the other naysayers want to jump all over this post 
fine  I jumped all over Steve in Sci Med Nutrition because he verbably 
accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin 
A and antifungals for a candida bloom in her gut  People seeking advice 
from newsnet should not be treated this way  Those of us giving of our 
time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content  If you saved 
your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly 
seeking help alone I wouldnt have a problem with your behavior 

Brave soul you are  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one
develops an immunity to it  One year ago my phlegmatic self would have
backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis  But my immune
system and my computer system have been hardened from gradual
desensitization  I now kind of like being called anal retentive  it has
a nice ring to it  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
post  truly classic worthy of a blue or maybe brown ribbon  I might
even crosspost it to altbestofinternet  Hmmm

Thanks again for a great and informative post  I hope others who have
researched this area and are lurking in the background will post their
thoughts as well no matter their views on this subject
