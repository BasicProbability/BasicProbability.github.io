Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

Anecedotal evidence is worthless  Even doctors who have been using a drug
or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised
at the results of clinical trials  Whether or not MSG causes describable
reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover  

I tend to disagree I think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it
and it is fairly consistent will is very important  First it points to the
necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are
all psychological or possibly allergy in this case  As Ive pointed out 
before pyschological effects are no less real than other effects  One       
persons makebelieve can easily be another persons reality  Using 
psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example the hallucinations one
person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on
an acid trip there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going
to happen  Anyhow that was a pretty lame example but hopefully I made my
point its all a matter of perception and as long as someone ingesting MSG
perceives it as causing bad effects then she can definitely experience those
affects  On the other hand it could just be an allergy to the food its in   or something  Still anecdotal evidence is not worthless its the stuff that
leads to the study being done
