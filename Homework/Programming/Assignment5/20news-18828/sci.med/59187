Many of these cereals are cornbased After your post I looked in the
literature and located two articles that implicated corn contains
tryptophan and seizures The idea is that corn in the diet might
potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder not cause it
Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based Id be interested

Years ago when I was an intern an obese young woman was brought into
the ER comatose after having been reported to have grand mal seizures
why attending a corn festival  We pumped her stomach and obtained
what seemed like a couple of liters of corn much of it intact kernals  
After a few hours she woke up and was fine  I was tempted to sign her out as
acute corn intoxication

Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and

How about contaminants on the corn eg aflatoxin
