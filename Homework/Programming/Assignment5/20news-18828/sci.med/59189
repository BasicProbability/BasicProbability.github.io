Hi

Ive just returned from a visit with my OBGYN and I have a few 
concerns that maybe yall can help me with  Ive been seeing 
her every 4 weeks for the past few months Im at week 28 
and during the last 2 visits Ive gained 9 to 9 12 pounds every 
4 weeks  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period 
As it stands Ive thus far gained 26 pounds  Also she says that 
though Im at 28 weeks the babys size is 27 weeks I think she 
mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus  When I was 13 
weeks the babys size was 14 weeks  I must also add that I had 
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and Ive had no 
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain 
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and I have a very 
difficult time moving and the doc has recommended I not walk or 
move unless I have to I have a little handicapped sticker for 
when I do need to go out 

Anyway thats 12 of the situation the other is that almost from 
the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick throwing up about 
23 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated  
I told her about this  I know this because I wasnt eating 
very much due to the nausea and could see the results  Well 
now I only get sick about once every 12 weeks and it is still bile 
related  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my 
upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when I 
was lying on my right side  It began to get worse though because 
it started to hurt when I lay on my right side and then it hurt  
no matter what position I was in  Next I noticed that when I 
ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had 
turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse  However if 
I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it 
wasnt as much of a problem

So the doctor says I have cholistatis and that I should avoid 
fatty foods  This makes sense and because I was already aware 
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have 
been avoiding these foods on my own  But Im still able to eat 
foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods  

But doc wants me to be on a nonfat diet  This means no meat 
except fish and chicken wo skin I do this anyway  No nuts 
fried food cheese etc  I am allowed skim milk  She said I 
should avoid anything sweet eg bananas  Also I must only 
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day  
potatoes pasta rice  She said I cant even cook vegetables in 
a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or 
steamed  Im concerned because I understand you need to have 
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process  And if 
Im not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it 
from my stores  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if 
shes concerned about fat  Im not clear how much of her 
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on 
cholistatis which I cant seem to find any information on  She 
originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the 
entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I 
started  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and 
shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems  She also 
asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them 
are  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain 
and feel like Im being punished by a severe diet  She did 
want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be 
temporary for that one week 

What I want to know is how reasonable is this nonfat diet  I 
would understand if she had said lowfat diet since Im trying 
that anyway even if she said really lowfat diet  I think she 
assumes I must be eating a highfat diet but really it is that 
because of the endometriosis and the operation Im not able to 
use the energy from the food I do eat 

Any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated  Im 
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet 
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few 
minutes and Ill end up having to eat constantly  Thus far I 
dont find any foods satisfying

Thanks 

G
