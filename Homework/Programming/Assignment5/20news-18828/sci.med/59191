Subject Re HELP for Kidney Stones 


   Isnt there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving
   a noninvasive use of ultrasound where the patient is lowered
   into some sort of liquid when heshe undergoes treatment Im sure
   Ive read about it somewhere If I remember it correctly it is a
   painless and effective treatment
   A couple of weeks ago I visited a hospital here in Stockholm and
   saw big signs showing the way to the Kidney stone chrusher
