Subject Re Science and methodology was Homeopathy  tradition

In article 1quqlgINN83qim4ucsutexasedu turpincsutexasedu Russell Turpin writes
 My definition is this Science is the investigation of the empirical
that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous
work

Reading this definition I wonder when should you recognize something
as being a mistake It seems to me that proponents of pseudosciences
might have their own ideas of what constitutes a mistake and which
discoveries of such previous mistakes they accept
