Subject French to English translation of medical terms

Dear Netters

I am not sure whether this is the right place to post my query but I
thought there may be some bilingual physicians in this newsgroup that
could help Please excuse me for overloading the bandwidth

I am trying to build a resource allocation program for managing a
surgical operating unit in a hospital The user interface is in
English however the terms of medical specialties I was given are in
French  I have no medical dictionary handy mine is a technical
university 

I need to get the translation into English when there is one of the
following words They refer to medical categories of operating rooms
theaters I admit they may not be universally used

1 sceptique
2 orl
3 brulurebrule
4 neonatal
5 prenatal
6 premature
7 neurochirurgie neurosurgery
8 chirurgie generale
9 chirurgie plastique
10 urologie urology

Thank you for you help
Cheers
