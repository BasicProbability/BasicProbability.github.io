 A friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of Crohns
 disease

 But she cant seem to eat certain foods such as fresh vegetables
 without discomfort and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence

 Her question is are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with Crohns disease 

 I saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric

 Thanks in advance

 All your friend really has to do is find a Registered DieticianRD  While
 most work in hospitals and clinics many major cities will have RDs who
 are in private practice so to speak  Many physicans will refer their
 patients with Crohns disease to RDs for dietary help  If you can get
 your friends physician to make a referral medical insurance should pay for
 the RDs services just like the services of a physical therapist  The
 better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends
 plan doesnt it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to
 control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal
 Crohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and
 lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but
 Im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors  For


If you do a MEDLINE search on turmeric youll see that it is a potent
lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas
Im in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my
hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs a 2000
bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused
Langendorff sheep heart The turmeric was more effective 


A colleague of mine in the School of Pharmacy Dr Ron Kohen has a paper in
press on the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of tea

 bad inflammation steroids are used but for a mild case the side effects
 are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use  Upjohn is developing
 a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with
 inflammatory diseases but its not available yet
