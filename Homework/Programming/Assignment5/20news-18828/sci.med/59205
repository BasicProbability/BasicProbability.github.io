Subject Choleric and The Great NTNF Semantic War

Crossposted from altpsychologypersonality since it talks about
 physicians personalities  Apologies to scimed readers not
 familiar with the MyersBriggs NTNF personality terms  But
 in a word or two the NTs iNtuitiveThinkers are approximately your
 philosophysciencetech pragmatic types and the NFs iNtuitiveFeelers
 are your humanitiessocialsciencetheology idealistic types  They
 hate each others guts  but tend to intermarry
 The letter J is a reference to conscienciousnessdecisiveness

Jon Noring emits typical NFtype stuff 
 Physicians are just responding in their natural way
 HyperCholeric Syndrome HCS  
 it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of
 physicians will type out as NT 
 One driving characteristic of an NT especially an NTJ is their obvious
 choleric behavior driver type A etc  the extreme emotional need to
 control to lead andor to be the best or the most competent 

Please get it right Jon
This NTJ has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes
 because the NFs of this world are fouling the oncepristine NT
 intellectual nest with their verbal poop

The dominant correlation is NT  Phlegmatic and not NT  Choleric
One of the semantic roots of choleric is the idea of hot emotional
and one of the semantic roots of phlegmatic is cold unemotional

Here is a thumbnail sketch taken from Hans Eysenck refering to Wundt
relating the Ancient Greek quadratic typology with modern terms

I suspect that your characterisation of NTs as choleric is what
you psychtypes call a projection of your own NFness onto us

 Maybe we need more NF doctors  

Perhaps in serious pediatics and my little boys got a runny
nose doctor general practice but please God not in neurology
opthamology urology etc etc  And NFpsychiatry should seperate
from NTie real psychiatry and be given a new name  something 
like channeling
