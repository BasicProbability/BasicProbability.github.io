Anecedotal evidence is worthless  Even doctors who have been using a drug
or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised
at the results of clinical trials  Whether or not MSG causes describable
reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover  

But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal
evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will
NEVER lead anywhere  Im sure somebody here can provide an example where
anecdotal evidence and the interpretation of it was upheldverified by
followon rigorous clinical trials


I tend to disagree I think anecdotal evidence provided there is a lot of it
and it is fairly consistent will is very important  First it points to the
necessity of doing a study and second it at least says that the effects are
all psychological or possibly allergy in this case  As Ive pointed out 
persons makebelieve can easily be another persons reality

Good point  There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to circle
the wagons to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless
maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence
to support controversial subjects such as the yeast hypothesis  But
evidence is evidence  it requires a jury or a process to sort it out and
determine the truth from the junk  Medicine must continue to strive to better
understand the workings of the bodymind for the purpose of alleviating
illness  anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle  it is not
worthless  Rather it can help focus limited resources in the right direction
