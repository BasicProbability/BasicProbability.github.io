Subject How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation

I got asked in Sci Med Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production
toxic kidney stone formation  I decided to post my answer here as well 
because of the recent question about kidney stones  Not long after I got 
into Sci Med I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium 
would prevent kidney stone formation  Im going to state it again here
But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 
supplements  Read on to find out whyI have my asbestos suit on now guys

Vitamin C will form oxalic acid  But large doses are needed above 6 grams 
per day

	1 Review Article Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney 
	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C Int Clin Nutr Rev
	   531101291985

But glycine also forms oxalic acidDamino acid oxidases  For both 
glycine and vitamin C one of the best ways to drastically reduce this 
production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine 
but to increase your intake of vitamin B6

	2 Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in 
	    patients with kidney stones Int Urol Nephrol 204353591988
	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary 
	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program

	3 The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria Clin Sci 38
	   277861970  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day 
	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels

For gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activityB6 is 
required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for 
oxidative deaminationDamino acid oxidases  For vitamin C the effect is 
quite different  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism  
The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40 
of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid  But this is highly variable 
and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 
6 grams per day not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic 
acid  At very high doses of vitamin Cabove 10 grams per day more of the 
extra vitamin C more than 40 conversion can end up as oxalic acid  In a 
very early study on vitamin C and oxalic productionProc Soc Exp Biol 
Med 85190921954 intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day 
increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg 
per day  Until 8 grams per day was reached the average excreted was 
increased by only 3 to 12mg per day2 gram dose 4 gram dose 8 gram dose 
and 9gram dose 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion 
before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average 
before supplementation

B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body  There 
are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we dont know about 
yet  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the 
speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must 
have an enzyme in it that requires B6  Differences in B6 levels could then 
explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C 
challengethis is not the preferred route of catabolism  Increasing your 
intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you 
take vitamin C supplements  Since the typical American diet is deficient 
in B6 some researchers believe that the main cause of calciumoxalate 
kidney stones is B6 deficiencyespecially since so little oxalic acid gets 
absorbed from the gut  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day 
showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalateUrol Int35309
151980  If 400mg was present each day there was a significant increase 
in urinary oxalate excretion

	Here are the high oxalate foods

	1 Beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea
	   Contain at least 25mg100grams

	2 Beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale 
	   peanuts pepper sweet potatoe
	   Contain 10 to 25 mg100grams

If the threshold is 130mg per day you can see that you really have a lot 
of latitude in food selection  A recent NEngJ Med article also points 
out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your 
intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being 
absorbed at all  If you also increase your intake of B6 you shouldnt 
have to worry about kidney stones at all The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for 
males and 16mg per day for femalesdirectly related to protein intake
B6 can be toxicnerve damage if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more 
per day for an extended peroidweeks to months  

The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 187 mg per day 
for males and 116mg per day for females living in the US  Coupled with 
this low intake was a high protein dietwhich greatly increases the B6 
requirement as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that 
either block B6 absorption are metabolic antagonists of B6 or promote B6 
excretion in the urine  Common ones are birth control pills alcohol
isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids  I tell my students to 
supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that 
increase the B6 requirement  The dose recommended for patients taking 
birth control pills is 1015mg per day and this should work for most of the 
other drugs that increase the B6 requirementthis would be on top of your 
dietary intake of B6  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone 
formation should be given B6 supplements

One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your 
CaMg dietary ratio is 21  Magnesiumoxalate is much more soluble than is 
calciumoxalate

There are actually about three times as many articles published in the 
medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone 
formation than there are for B6  I thought that I was being pretty safe in 
stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier 
post in this news group but good old John A in Mass jumped all over me I 
guess that he doesnt read the medical literature  Oh well since kidney 
stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them I thought 
Id tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctors office
