Would anyone out there in netland happen to have an
authentic surefire way of making this great sauce that
is used to adorn Gyros and Souvlaki

Im not sure of the exact recipe but Im sure acidophilus is one of
the major ingredients   


The only recipies Ive ever seen for this include plain yogurt finely
chopped cucumber and a couple of crushed cloves of garlic  yummy
