Hate to wreck your elaborate theory but Steve Dyer is not an MD
So professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with
Nystatin etc cant very well come into the picture  Steve
doesnt have any patients



response to specificially Candida albicans and I showed a strong positive
Another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless  And assuming it is true that Candida can grow

Yes everyone who is normal does that  We use candida on the other arm
when we put a tuberculin test on  If people dont react to candida
we assume the TB test was not conclusive since such people may not
react to anything  All normal people have antibodies to candida
If not you would quickly turn into a fungus ball

This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the
appropriate studies are done  And that is if you cant observe or culture
the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then theres no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body

Its a real Catch22


Youve just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory
Find something that no one can disprove and then write a book saying
it is the cause of whatever  Since no one can disprove it you can
rake in the bucks for quite some time  

I have often wondered what an MD with chronic 
GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
patients is a nonexistent syndrome


That is odd isnt it  Why do you suppose it is that MDs with these
common problems dont go for these crazy ideas  Does the professional
jealosy extend to suffering in silence even though they know they
could be cured if they just followed this quack book
