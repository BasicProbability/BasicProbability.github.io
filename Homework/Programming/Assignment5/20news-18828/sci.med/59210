 and in 1946 when the National Health Service was established
homeopathy was included as an officially approved method
of treatment

I was there in 1976  I suppose it must have died out since 1946
then  Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in
the employ of the NHS  Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities
refused to hire any homeopaths  A similar law in the US allows
chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but Ive never seen one
there and I dont know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor
There are a lot of Britons on the net so someone should be able to
tell us if the NHS provides homeopaths for you
