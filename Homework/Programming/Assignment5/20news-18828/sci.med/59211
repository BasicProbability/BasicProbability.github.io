Subject EpsteinBarr Syndrome questions

Okay this is a long shot

My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosistype symptoms very  
regularly  This has been going on for a number of years  Shes seen a  
number of doctors six was the last count I think  Most of them have  
said either You have mono or Youre full of it theres nothing wrong  
with you  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her  
and one has claimed that it is EpsteinBarr syndrome

Now what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  
it exists  Obviously this has been her experience  So whats the  
story  Is it real  Does the medical profession believe it to be real

Has anyone had success is treating EBS  Or is it just something to live  
with  Thanks for your assistance
