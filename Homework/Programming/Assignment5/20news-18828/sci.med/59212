   Many of these cereals are cornbased After your post I looked in the
   literature and located two articles that implicated corn contains
   tryptophan and seizures The idea is that corn in the diet might
   potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder not cause it
   Check to see if the two Kellog cereals are corn based Id be interested
   
   Years ago when I was an intern an obese young woman was brought into
   the ER comatose after having been reported to have grand mal seizures
   why attending a corn festival  We pumped her stomach and obtained
   what seemed like a couple of liters of corn much of it intact kernals  
   After a few hours she woke up and was fine  I was tempted to sign her out as
   acute corn intoxication
   
   Gordon Banks  N3JXP       Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and

   How about contaminants on the corn eg aflatoxin
