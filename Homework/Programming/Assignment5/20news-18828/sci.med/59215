doctors said that he could die from it and the medication caused

	Is it that serious  My EKG often comes back with a few irregular
beats  Another question  Is a low blood potassium level very bad  My
doctor seems concerned but she tends to worry too much in general

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal
heart rhythms cardiac dysrhythmias  Some of them are very serious
while others are completely benign  Having a few irregular beats
on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and
when they occurred or could be of no significance

Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying
heart disease to develop arrhythmias  Very low potassium levels are
clearly dangerous but it is not clear how much of a problem
lowendofnormal levels are  a lot of cardiologists seem to treat
anyone with even a mildly lownormal potassium level
