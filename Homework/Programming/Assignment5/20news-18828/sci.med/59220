Subject Re diet for Crohns IBD

One thing that I havent seen in this thread is a discussion of the
relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty
acids FAs

I was diagnosed last May wCrohns of the terminal ileum When I got
out of the hospital I read up on it a bit and came across several
studies investigating the role of EPA an essentially FA in reducing
inflammation The evidence was mixed Many of these studies are
discussed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease MacDermott Stenson 1992

But if I recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be
picked with the studies both the ones wpos and wneg results In
the studies patients were given EPA a few gramsday for most of the
studies but if I recall correctly there was no restriction of the
other FAs that the patients could consume From the informed
laypersons perspective this seems mistaken If lots of n6 FAs are
consumed along with the EPA then the ratio of bad prostanoid
products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad
Isnt this ratio the issue

Whats the view of the gastro community on EPA these days EPA
supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs
appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the
low absolute amount of fat I eat  810 calories
