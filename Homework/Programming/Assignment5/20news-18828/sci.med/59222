Okay this is a long shot

My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosistype symptoms very  
regularly  This has been going on for a number of years  Shes seen a  
number of doctors six was the last count I think  Most of them have  
said either You have mono or Youre full of it theres nothing wrong  
with you  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her  
and one has claimed that it is EpsteinBarr syndrome

Now what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  
it exists  Obviously this has been her experience  So whats the  
story  Is it real  Does the medical profession believe it to be real

Has anyone had success is treating EBS  Or is it just something to live  
with  Thanks for your assistance

Outbreaks of a chronicmonolike entity were originally called EBS or
some variant thereof because most of the people with this disease had
elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus But not all of them
did which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal
Medicine Jan 1988 I believe Now its also called Chronic Fatigue
and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome CFIDS since it seems clear that
some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs

Astonishly there are still docs who tell people with massively
swollen glands recurrent fevers and nightsweats etc that theres
nothing wrong with them This is not the same thing as saying that the
syndrome may have a at least partly psychological cause The
disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers
on just what the cause is No one knows but theories include
psychological stress some sort of virus a retrovirus say most 
maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses environmental
toxins bacteria and yes candida genes andor some combo of
these

Theres no outright cure at the moment but different docs try
different things some of which seem to help

Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days
Post your Q to altmedcfs and you will be flooded wfacts

Note There are lots of far better understood and better treatable
diseases that look like CFIDS Make sure these get ruledout by a good
doc
