Subject Re Great Post was Re Candida yeast Bloom VERY LONG

In article turpincsutexasedu Russell Turpin writes

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as
hardtosee candida infections causing various problems should not
be investigated  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by 
figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought
virtually impossible to test for

Indeed I would be surprised if candida overbloom were such a
phenomena  I would think that candida would produce signature
byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the 
extent of recent infection  I realize this might get quite 
tricky and difficult probably expensive and likely inconvenient
or uncomfortable to the subjects but that is not the same as 
virtually impossible

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the Yeast Connection
that there is indeed work by researchers to do this  Of course they are
working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
membrane tissue with associated mild inflammatory response can and does
occur in a large number of people  If you reject this yeast hypothesis
then Id guess youd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic
endeavor  Stay tuned
