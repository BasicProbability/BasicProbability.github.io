As for how foods taste  If Im not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it why shouldnt I use it  Saying I shouldnt use
it is like saying I shouldnt eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

 Nobody is saying that you shouldnt be allowed to use msg  Just
dont force it on others If you have food that you want to 
enhance with msg just put the MSG on the table like salt  It is
then the option of the eater to use it  If you make a commerical
product just leave it out You can include a packet like some
salt packets if you desire

Salt pepper mustard ketchup pickles  are table options
Treat MSG the same way  I wouldnt shove my condiments down your
throat dont shove yours down mine
