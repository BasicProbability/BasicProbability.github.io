Do you believe that any quacks exist  How about quack diagnoses  Is
being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
other people shouldnt say so  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous healers taking advantage of
people


I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors of
the squeakyclean traditional crewcut talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment kind who recommend treatments that though accepted may
not be necessary for the patient at the time  And all for making a quick
buck  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the US is
significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color  In fact Id
say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the
true focus of the medical profession  The AMA and the Boards should focus
on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on searchand
destroymissions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditionalaccepted medicine cannot help



Now to make a general comment on many recent posts


Lately Ive seen the word quack bandied about recklessly  When a doctor or
doctorwannabe has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical
subject in a civilized manner all heshe has to do is say quackquack and
somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over
on their backs and peepee on themselves in obedience  What do they teach
you in medical school  how to throw your authority around

Let me put it another way to make my point clear  quack is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand
The indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency  and coming
from any medical doctor or wannabe where competency is expected is real
scary

But what do I know Ive already been diagnosed by the scimedgods in this
newsgroup as being anal retentive and psychotic  I look forward to more
netdiagnoses  Hey theyre free


Jon Quacks R Us Noring


ps may I suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group
You can call it scimedtraditionalmoderated or scimedAMAapproved so you
can keep analretentives like me out of it
