 Would anyone out there in netland happen to have an
 authentic surefire way of making this great sauce that
 is used to adorn Gyros and Souvlaki
 
 Im not sure of the exact recipe but Im sure acidophilus is one of
 the major ingredients   

Its plain yoghurt with grated cucumber and coriander other spices are
sometimes used Some people use half yoghurt and half mayonaise
