Subject Re Heat Shock Proteins

rousseauaimmunexcom writes about heat shock proteins HSPs and DNA

I hate to be derogatory but in this case I think its warranted

HSPs are part of the cellular response to stress  The only reason they
are called heat shock proteins is because they were first demonstrated
using heat shock  Dead tissue ie meat is not going to produce ANY
protein because its DEAD  

Also who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated  It will be 
completely digested in your stomach which is about pH 2  

Some of you worry WAY too much  Eat a healthy balanced diet and relax

My advice is if you dont know what you are talking about it is better
to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
ignorance  Dont speculate or at least get some concrete information
before you do
