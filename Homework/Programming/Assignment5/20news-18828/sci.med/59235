Subject Re eye dominance

In article C5E2G7877worldstdcom rsilverworldstdcom Richard Silver writes

   Is there a righteye dominance eyedness as there is an
   overall righthandedness in the population I mean do most
   people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the
   other If so what kinds of percentages can be attached to this
   Thanks 


Yes there is such a thing as eye dominance although I am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength

As i recall if you selectively close your dominant eye you will percieve
that the image shifts This will not happen if you close your other eye

I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness but I
cant recall the relation at the moment
