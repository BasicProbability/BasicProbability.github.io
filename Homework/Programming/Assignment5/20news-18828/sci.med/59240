Subject Re Adult Chicken Pox 


I am 35 and am recovering from a case of Chicken Pox which I contracted
from my 5 year old daughter  I have quite a few of these little puppies
all over my bod  At what point am I no longer infectious  My physicians
office says when they are all scabbed over  Is this true

I have been in the same boat as you last year Ive tried four times to
send you an email response but your end doesnt seem to accept my mail
Please let me know if you receive this

Cheers Nigel
