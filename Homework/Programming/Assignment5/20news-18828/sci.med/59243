Subject Sweets Syndrome 


	My brothers affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweets
syndrome Also called steroid resistant Sweets syndrome

	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for
hyperthyroidism Shed been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it 

	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but shes isnt being treated by an endocrinologist Her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital She entered the
hospital because of the Sweets syndrome symptoms skin lesions

Ive looked through the last two years of Medline and didnt find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets  

I checked a handbook which said that Sweets was associated with leukemia

Id like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel
to New York City For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology

Any information that might help Apparently there hasnt been much
improvement in her condition over the past several months
