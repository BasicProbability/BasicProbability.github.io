My 6 year son is so plagued  Lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
to keep it under control  But let him get bopped there and hell recur for 
days  Also allergies colds dry air all seem to contribute  But again the 
vaseline or AD ointment or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring

If you can get it you might want to try a Canadian overthecounter product
called Secaris which is a watersoluble gel  Compared to Vaseline or other
greasy ointments Secaris seems more compatible with the moisture thats
already there


Secaris is reasonably inexpensive 600 Cdn for a tube and is indeed an
over the counter medication Why it does not appear to be available in the
US I dont know Its manufactured in Montreal

Its a nasal lubricant and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from
dry mucous membranes

From some of the replies to my original posting its evident that some
people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
from environmental influences ie dry air But Ive had no responses
from anyone with experience with Rutin Is there another newsgroup that
might have specifics on herbal remedies

But thanks to all those who did reply with their experiences
