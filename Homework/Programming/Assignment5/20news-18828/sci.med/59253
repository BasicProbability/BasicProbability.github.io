Subject Adenocarcinoma of the Lungs

Putting aside our substantial differences Id like to ask the knowledgeable
ones to give feedback on this  Let me explain

One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after
having some difficulties with walking and writing she is 64 years old
Otherwise she is in fine health  The discovery was made via CAT scans

She then had MRI scans done where small cancerous areas were discovered
in her lungs  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma  One spot is
in the lungs and another in the pneumothorax  The oncologists believe
the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor she smoked
until four years ago

Anyway Id like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is how it is different
from other cancers how she will be treated luckily the tumor is right
below the skull and can be easily removed and statistically what are
the chances for full remissionrecovery

Thanks
