Subject Annual inguinal hernia repair

Last year I was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia  I couldnt remember doing anything that would have
caused it  That is I hadnt been lifting more than other people do
and in fact probably somewhat less  Eventually the thing became more
painful and I had the repair operation

This year I developed a pain on the other side  This turned out to be
another inguinal hernia  So I go back to the hospital Monday for
another fun 8 operation

I dont know of anything Im doing to cause this to happen  Im 38
years old and I dont think Im old enough for things to start falling
apart like this  The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness but if so why did it suddenly appear
when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger

Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia other than not lifting
anything  Its rare that I lift more than my 16monthold or a sack
full of groceries and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days  Is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk

Of course my wife thinks its from sitting for long periods of time at
the computer reading news
