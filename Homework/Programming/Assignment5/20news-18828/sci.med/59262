As for how foods taste  If Im not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it why shouldnt I use it  Saying I shouldnt use
it is like saying I shouldnt eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

Julie it doesnt necessarily follow that you should use it MSG or
something else for that matter simply because you are not allergic
to it For example you might not be allergic to animal fats and
like their taste yet it doesnt follow that you should be using them
regularly MSG might have other bad or good I am not up on 
knowledge of MSG effects on your body in the long run maybe thats
reason enough not to use it 

Altho your example of the ulcer is funny it isnt an
appropriate comparison at all
