Subject Re Can men get yeast infections

 To smithmcmentorccpurdueedu Lost Boy

 LB I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections I 
 LB get rather nasty ones from time to time mostly in the area of the
 LB scrotum and the base of the penis 

I used to have problems with recurrent athletes foot until I 
started drying between my toes with my blow drier after each time 
I bathe  I also dry my pubic area while I am at it to prevent 
problems  You might want to try it
