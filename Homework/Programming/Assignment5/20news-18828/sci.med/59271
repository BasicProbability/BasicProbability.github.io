Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick  And EVERY
time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products

Which points up the studies made by amateurs  Did you ALSO check EVERY TIME
YOU DID NOT get sick  No you say  Why not check every thing you eat when
you dont get sick and find out how much MSG youre actually consuming

 All thats needed now is that final step a doubleblind study done
 on humans  There isnt even an ethical question about possible
 harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive

But  some say that only 2 of the population has a problem with MSG 
some say its more like 20  but lets say that its 5  How many
people would have to be tested that would have a problem  Also  I
KNOW I have a problem with it and I wouldnt VOLUNTEER for a test

If you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didnt want
to participate because it involved MSG youdve already made yourself
ineligible since MSG IS detectable by taste How can anybody be so clueless
as to what double blind studies are all about

unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
