Subject Re Use of haldol in elderly

In article YfqmleK00iV185Co5Landrewcmuedu Lawrence Curcio lc2bandrewcmuedu writes
Ive seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays In the examples Ive seen drugs were
definitely involved 
 
My own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital He was fiftythree at the time and he was on 21 separate
drugs

No wonder he became confused  With so many drugs it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem  And because some drugs 
potentiate the effect of each other they can make the side effects
all the worse and even dangerous  kinda like mixing alcohol and 
antihistamines

he was disoriened the doctors thougt  they should put him on something
else as well

Unfortunately doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving  If one drug they are taking causes
the patients blood pressure to go up many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of reevaluating the need for the original drug
This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home

procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss
it with an independent doc Her problems may not be the effect of HALDOL
at all HALDOL may have been used validly or it may have been
prescribed because OTHER medication confused her and because the
hospital normally prescribes HALDOL for the confused elderly

I fully agree  In addition she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can reevaluate the need for the medications she is taking
I cant remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug reevaluated regularly  If her current physician
is unwilling to do this find one who will  Either check the phone 
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology 
or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society
By finding a geriatric specialist he she will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help
