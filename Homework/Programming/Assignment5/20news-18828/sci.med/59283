               Rates of Cesarean Delivery  United States 1991

     Cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the 
approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the United States since 1986 
Table 1 The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 
21 reporting countries exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico 1 This 
report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDCs National Hospital 
Discharge Survey NHDS for 1991 and compares these data with previous years 
     Data on discharges from shortstay nonfederal hospitals have been 
collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS conducted by CDCs National Center 
for Health Statistics For 1991 medical and demographic information were 
abstracted from a sample of 274000 inpatients discharged from 484 
participating hospitals The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior 
cesarean VBAC presented in this report are based on weighted national 
estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31000 11 women discharged 
after delivery The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were 
calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from 
national vital registration data Therefore estimates of the number of 
cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based 
solely on the NHDS 2 Stated differences in this analysis are significant at 
the 95 confidence level based on the twotailed ttest with a critical value 
of 196 
     In 1991 there were 235 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate as 
in 1990 and similar to rates during 19861989 Table 1 The primary cesarean 
rate ie number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no 
previous cesareans for 19861991 also was stable ranging from 168 to 175 
In 1991 the cesarean rate in the South was 276 significantly p005 
higher than the rates for the West 198 Midwest 218 and Northeast 
226 Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years 
than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or 
government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger 
hospitals and for deliveries for which Blue CrossBlue Shield  and other 
private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of 
payment Table 2 The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries 
     Since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older women 
increased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained 
the same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 233 
essentially the same as the 235 observed 
     Based on the NHDS of the approximately 4111000 live births in 1991 an

estimated 966000 235 were by cesarean delivery Of these an estimated 
338000 350 births were repeat cesareans and 628000 650 were primary 
cesareans Since 1986 approximately 600000 primary cesareans have been 
performed annually In 1986 85 of women who had a previous cesarean 
delivered vaginally compared with 242 in 1991 Of all cesareans in 1991 
350 were associated with a previous cesarean 304 with dystocia ie 
failure of labor to progress 117 with breech presentation 92 with fetal 
distress and 137 with all other specified complications 
     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 28 days In 
comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 45 days 
and for a repeat cesarean 42 days  nearly twice the duration for VBAC 
deliveries 22 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs 23 
days In 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 32 days for 
primary cesareans 52 days for repeat cesareans 47 days and for VBAC and 
nonVBAC vaginal deliveries 27 and 26 days respectively

Editorial Note The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 
1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rates 
have been stable since 1986 3 Because there is little evidence that 
maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because 
cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of 
childbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the 
overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary 
cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 148 
     Postpartum complications  including urinary tract and wound infections 
 may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries 
than for vaginal births 5 Moreover the prolonged hospital stays for 
cesarean deliveries substantially increase healthcare costs For example in 
1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and 
4720 respectively The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 
611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 If the cesarean 
rate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 235 the number 
of cesarean births would have decreased by 349000 617000 versus 966000 
resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospital 
charges 
     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 several factors may 
impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean 
delivery For example VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women 
offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7 
Of women who are offered a trial of labor 5070 could deliver vaginally 7 
a level already achieved by many hospitals 8 Trial of labor was routinely 
offered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for which

Volume  6 Number 11                                           April 25 1993

national data are available 9 when the VBAC rate according to NHDS data 
was 57 The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35 based on all 
women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was 
attempted To reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the 
VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary 
rate 
     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by 
applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean 
delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peerreview 
process 10 Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates 
include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing 
reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of 
physician and hospitalspecific cesarean delivery rates to increase public 
awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns 
which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean 
delivery 4

     The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a 
challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance 
Although the risk of acquiring malaria for US citizens and their dependents 
stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and 
unpredictably During May 1992 the Office of Medical Services Department of 
State OMSDOS and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases 
among official US personnel stationed in Kampala Uganda A review of the 
health records from the Embassy Health Unit EHU in Kampala indicated that 27 
cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 
1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 EHU OMSDOS and 
CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and 
identify potential risk factors for malaria among US Embassy personnel This 
report summarizes the results of the investigation 
     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported casepatients were 
available for review by OMSDOS and CDC A case of malaria was confirmed if 
the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp Of the 25 persons 17 were slide
confirmed as having malaria 
     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to 
obtain information about residence activities use of malaria 
chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures ie using bednets 
and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long 
sleeves and pants in the evening Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey 
128 82 responded 
     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in 
Kampala Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less 
than or equal to 15 years 632 19 than among persons greater than 15 
years 1194 12 this difference was not significant relative risk 
RR16 95 confidence interval CI0640 Eightytwo percent of the 
cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 15 years 
compared with those living there less than 1 year Travel outside of the 
Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for 
malaria 
     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who 
participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine 
alone and proguanil alone In addition 23 18 persons who responded were 
not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis The risk for malaria was significantly 
lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil 888 
9 than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis 937 
24 RR04 95 CI0209 Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported 
side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason 
     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets

all or most of the time 227 7 than among persons who sometimes or rarely 
used bednets 1599 15 RR05 95 CI0120 The risk for malaria was 
also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening

upper 95 confidence limit12 Risk for malaria was not associated with 
failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the 
evening 
     As a result of this investigation EHU staff reviewed with all personnel 
the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection 
measures and made plans to obtain insecticideimpregnated bednets and to 
provide window and door screens for all personnel

Editorial Note In Uganda the increase in malaria among US personnel was 
attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased 
malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in subSaharan 
Africa The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and 
continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in 
malariaendemic areas  preventive measures that are also important for 
shortterm travelers to such areas 
     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most 
other areas with chloroquineresistant P falciparum however in some areas 
eg Thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness In 
Africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in 
preventing infection with P falciparum is 92 1  Mefloquine is safe and 
well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2year period The risk 
for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis 
eg psychosis and convulsions is low ie 1319 episodes per 100000 
users 2 while the risk for less severe adverse reactions eg dizziness 
gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for 
other antimalarial chemoprophylactics 1 
     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need 
for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 
34 Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense 
chloroquine resistance eg Southeast Asia and Africa In Africa for 
persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline chloroquine and proguanil 
is an alternative although less effective regimen Chloroquine should be 
used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquineresistant P 
falciparum has not been reported

     Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib conjugate vaccines have been 
recommended for use in infants since 1990 and their routine use in infant 
vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib 
disease in the United States 13 Vaccines against diphtheria tetanus and 
pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the 
United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 
90 reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these 
organisms Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely 
recommended for infants a high priority is the development of combined 
vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate 
injections 
     The Food and Drug Administration FDA recently licensed two new products 
for vaccinating children against these diseases 1 the Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccine tetanus toxoid conjugate ActHIB Trademark  for 
vaccination against Hib disease only and 2 a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and wholecell pertussis vaccine DTP and Hib conjugate vaccine 
TETRAMUNE Trademark a combination of vaccines formulated for use in 
vaccinating children against diphtheria tetanus pertussis and Hib disease 

                               ActHIB Trademark 

     On March 30 1993 the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine polyribosylribitol phosphatetetanus toxoid conjugate PRPT 
manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB 
Trademark by Connaught Laboratories Inc Swiftwater Pennsylvania This 
vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a threedose primary 
vaccination series administered at ages 2 4 and 6 months Previously 
unvaccinated infants 711 months of age should receive two doses 2 months 
apart Previously unvaccinated children 1214 months of age should receive one 
dose A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all 
children Previously unvaccinated children 1559 months of age should receive 
a single dose and do not require a booster More than 90 of infants receiving 
a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark consecutive doses at 2 4 
and 6 months of age develop a geometric mean titer of antiHaemophilus b 
polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ugmL 4 This response is similar to 
that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed 
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in 
prospective trials Two US efficacy trials of PRPT were terminated early 
because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines

for use in infants 4 In these studies no cases of invasive Hib disease 
were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRPT These and 
other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRPT vaccine will be similar to 
that of the other licensed Hib vaccines TETRAMUNE Trademark 
     On March 30 1993 the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and wholecell pertussis vaccine DTP and Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine TETRAMUNE Trademark available from LederlePraxis Biologicals Pearl 
River New York combines two previously licensed products DTP TRIIMMUNOL 
Registered manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River New York and 
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine HibTITER Registered manufactured by Praxis 
Biologics Inc Rochester New York 
     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months5 years 
for protection against diphtheria tetanus pertussis and Hib disease when 
indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate 
vaccine coincide Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody 
responses to each of the components of the two vaccines TETRAMUNE Trademark 
is expected to provide protection against Hib as well as diphtheria tetanus 
and pertussis equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other 
DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines 
     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ACIP recommends that 
all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b 
conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12
15 months 5 The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a fourdose 
primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 
4 6 and 1518 months of age and a booster dose at 46 years 68 A 
complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and 
TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed

            International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of
                                 HIV Infection

                     National Institute of Dental Research

     At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection held January 31February 3 in San Francisco participants explored 
issues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal 
immunology and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection 
     The workshop was organized by Dr John Greenspan and Dr Deborah 
Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology School of Dentistry University of 
California San Francisco  An international steering committee and scientific 
program committee provided guidance 
     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries including 
Asia Africa Europe Central America South America as well as the United 
States and Canada  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National 
Institute of Dental Research the National Cancer Institute the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases the NIH Office of AIDS Research 
and the Procter and Gamble Company 
     Among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of HIV lesions ethics 
professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision 
of oral care to the HIVpositive population salivary HIV transmission and 
mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric HIV infection and 
womens issues 

                                Recommendations

     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association 
between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV to 
establish a universal terminology for HIVassociated oral lesions to look for 
more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology 
studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral 
lesions and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions 

                                 Epidemiology

     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV 
Infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of HIV infection has

radically changed  In 1988 HIV infection was detected and reported largely 
in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs  
Today more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in 
children and adolescents 
     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa a 
major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well  
Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more 
are appearing all the time 
     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions 
such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis  They also are beginning to explore 
the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression 
and prognosis 

                            Socialpolitical Issues

     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection 
focused on changing the publics attitude that AIDS is retribution for 
indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use  Speakers also addressed health 
care delivery for HIVinfected patients and the need to educate the public 
about what AIDS is and how it is acquired 

                          Saliva and Salivary Glands

     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIVinhibitory 
activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary 
secretions  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular 
secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid 
secretions  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible 
for salivary inhibitory activity  They attributed the HIVinhibitory effect 
of saliva to the 1 aggregationagglutination of HIV by saliva which may both 
promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and 2 
direct effects on the virus or target cells 
     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease 
in HIVinfected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity 

                               Pediatric Issues

     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest  With 
early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of HIV
infected children has tripled  The prevention of transmission of HIV from 
mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mothers 
serostatus is known prior to giving birth 

                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease

     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and 
gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection  Recommendations made at 
the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of 
diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration 
of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy 

                       Occupational and Treatment Issues

     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIVinfected individuals 
and treatment rendered by HIVinfected health care professionals still command 
considerable attention  Factors under consideration include the costbenefit 
of HIV testing patienttohealth care provider transmission of HIV infection 
and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the 
treatment of HIVinfected patients 
     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on 
the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less  
Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence 
Company in late 1993
