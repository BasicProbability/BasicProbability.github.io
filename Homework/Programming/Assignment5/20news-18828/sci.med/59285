call for employers to keep  information about the HIV status of healthcare 
workers  confidential  But doctors who know of an HIVpositive colleague  who 
has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate 
professional regulatory body  The guidelines  also emphasize the significance 
of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an 
infected healthcare  worker  A model letter to patients who have come into 
contact  with such an individual is provided along with suggestions for  
health officials on how to deal with the media  In addition a  UK advisory 
panel on HIV infection in healthcare workers has  been formed to provide 
specific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients

     The questions raised by Moore et al about recombinant gp160  envelope 
glycoprotein precursor from HIV1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages 
rather than disadvantages write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of 
MicroGeneSys in Meriden  Conn  Moore et al says that gp160 in a baculovirus 
expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor and that this  
recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV1 virus 
does in natural infection  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in 
patients infected with HIV1 broadens HIV1  specific envelopedirected immune 
responses including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and 
CD8  cytotoxic Tcell responses  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never 
intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein  Antibody 
responses against native HIV1 proteins  including the types described by 
Moore et al exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent

progression of HIV disease  In addition the binding of gp120 or gp120
antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific 
activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which  
may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection  The absence of CD4 
binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added 
safety feature  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts 
stimulation of cytotoxic T cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune 
function  Based on  these and other clinical results MicroGeneSys gp160 was 
chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first 
phase III vaccine therapy studies conclude Volvovitz and  Smith

     There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV1positive 
women breastfeeding their babies writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet  The 
antiinfective properties of  milk are well documented  While the numbers of 
leukocytes  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA and lymphocyte mitogenic  
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to 
barely detectable levels lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to 
twelve months with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA  
Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory 
illnesses in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIVpositive 
mothers  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV
1 infected children had a longer median incubation time 19 months than 
bottlefed infants 97 months  Breastfed children also had a slower 
progression to AIDS  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer 
protection against HIV1 infection  Studies of  the biological properties of 
milk from 15 HIV1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA 
antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins as well as IgA antibodies against 
core antigens   Binding of HIV1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a 
human  milk factor  In the developing world where infectious disease  and 
malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality  breast milk is 
still the best food for infants regardless of the mothers HIV status  
Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early 
milk have been expressed  and discarded  The possibility remains that breast 
milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and  
may even delay progression to AIDS concludes Mok

et al of the University of Miami  School of Medicine in Miami Fla  The 
researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and 
attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing  Living patients 
with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed and DNA sequence  analysis 
was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the 
dentist  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the 
medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug 
abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail  
There were  1192 patients who had undergone 9267 procedures of whom 124  
were deceased  An examination of the death certificates of  patients 
identified five who had died with HIV infection all of  whom were either 
homosexuals or IVdrug users  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the 
remaining 1048 patients and 900  agreed to be tested  HIV infection was 
reported in five of the  900 patients including four who had clear evidence 
of risk  factors for the disease  One patient who had only a single  
evaluation by the dentist denied highrisk behavior  Comparative DNA sequence 
analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients 
were not closely related  The study  suggests the potential for HIV 
transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting 
in which  universal precautions are strictly observed conclude Dickinson  et 
al

AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB Study Says Washington 
Post 042293 P A13 

     Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once which makes the 
resurging health hazard harder to control according to a  study published in 
todays New England Journal of Medicine   People who contract TB usually 
develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria 
again  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight 
off a  new TB infection doctors found  Peter M Small of the Howard  Hughes 
Medical Institute at Stanford University director of the  study said that in 
order to protect against reinfection it may  be necessary for some people to 
use TB medicines permanently   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB 
bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County 
Hospital  in New York

HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS Lancet 041093 Vol 341 No 8850 P 957  
Duesberg Peter 

     Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS the  hypothesis 
that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a  hindrance to the 
physiologically AZT and psychologically  positive AIDS test toxic public 
health initiatives writes  Peter Duesberg of the University of California
Berkeley  In the Lancets March 13 issue Schechter et al call Duesbergs  
hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to 
AIDS a hindrance to public health initiatives   However their hypothesis 
that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits  
The US government spends  4 billion annually but no vaccine no therapy 
no prevention  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this 
hypothesis   Schechter et al conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  
depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies 
against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals 
from Vancouver  However their survey  neglects to disprove Duesbergs drug
AIDS hypothesis because it  does not provide controlsie confirmed drug
free AIDS  casesand because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  
use altogether  To refute Duesbergs hypothesis Schechter would  have to 
produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years 
HIVpositive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same 
AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so  The 10 year period is claimed by

proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS  
Alternatively they could show that HIVfree  individuals who have used drugs 
for 10 years never get  AIDSdefining illnesses concludes Duesberg 
   
Rapid Decline of CD4 Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV1  Infection 
Lancet 041093 Vol 341 No 8850 P 959   Vento Sandro et al 

     Interferon IFN which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases 
in some settings may hasten CD4 Tcell loss in some  HIV1 infected 
individuals through the amplification of harmful  autoimmune reactions 
write Sandro Vento et al of the A  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro Italy  
The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV1 infected individuals with 
hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis CAH who had a rapid  
profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN  All three patients  throughout the 
observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had 
circulating antibodies to p24  Sera from all three patients obtained at the 
end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzymelinked immunosorbent assay 
contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  
aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens 
homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV1 gp41  
These autoantibodies which also  recognize native class II molecules and 
may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells in vivo were at low tires 
50100  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN  Such  
autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and 
HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 Tcell loss 
in some HIV1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful 
autoimmune reactions  The subjects had A1 B8 DR3 and B35 DR1 HLA 
antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell 
counts and  clinical progression of HIV1 disease  IFN can induce a very  
rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with 
these HLA haplotypes the researchers conclude

TB Makes a Comeback State Government News 0493 Vol 36 No 4 P 6   
Voit William and Knapp Elaine S 

     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United 
States it is emerging again among the homeless AIDS  patients immigrants 
minorities and prisoners  Dr Lee B  Reichman professor of medicine at the 
University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung 
Association  said Right now its a big city problem but potentially its  
everyones problem  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected 
with TB and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their 
immune systems are depressed  especially those with AIDS or HIV  Gene

Tammes a Centers for  Disease Control expert said that is why the CDC has 
issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB 
patients  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because 
those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with 
treatment  In addition the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public 
health services   In New York City TB is an epidemic because the number of 
cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people said Dr George  
Diferdinando director of the New York State TB Control   According to 
Diferdinando curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of 
diagnosed TB cases in treatment   About 40 percent of infected New York City 
residents dont  complete therapy  When TB patients dont finish taking their  
medication multidrug resistant TB can develop which requires  taking more 
expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to 
treat
     
 Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern 
Florida Artifact or Reality American Journal of Public Health 0493 Vol 
83 No 4 P 571  Nwanyanwu Okey C et al 

     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in 
southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk write 
Okey C Nwanyanwu et al of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta Ga  
The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal 
Palm Beach counties  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual 
transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users 
or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route 
of HIV transmission  Medical records of patients  in addition to records 
from social services HIV counseling and  testing centers and sexually 
transmitted disease STD clinics  were reviewed  If no other HIV risk factor 
was found from  medical record review patients were interviewed using a  
standardized questionnaire  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were 
reviewed 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission 
categories  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification the 
percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties 
between January 1 1989 and March 31 1990 that was attributed to 
heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men 
and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women  While the percentage of  
heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after 
adjustment was made for reclassified cases it  still remained above the 
national average the researchers  conclude
