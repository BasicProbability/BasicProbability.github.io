Subject FREQUENT NOSEBLEEDS

A   From some of the replies to my original posting its evident that some
A   people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
                        
 Include small amounts of hot spicy foods with your meals Its
 not a cure but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus
 You may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water 
 consult your doctor first which is available OTC in Canada
 If you have a sedentary lifestyle exercising sometimes helps

A   from environmental influences ie dry air But Ive had no responses
A   from anyone with experience with Rutin Is there another newsgroup that
                      
A   might have specifics on herbal remedies

 I tried to email you but our board is having internet problems
 so Im not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not
 
 Rutin is NOT a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex You should
 generally not take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid 
 complex instead If you dont and there are some exceptions to that
 youll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the other
 major component of the bioflavonoid complex
 I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin after it
 showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be
 fore A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in 
 hesperidin which from then on made me always add bioflavonoids 
 to anyone that had very low levels of rutin
 Most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin so
 there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whole
 bioflavonoid complex instead

 I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that 
 they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose 
 bleeds aneurysms gastrointestinal bleeding due to drugs etc
 One patient in desperation took a whole bottle 100s in one day
 for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects
  
 They are also nontoxic in very high amounts thats why they can
 be safely recommended If you are allergic to citrus fruit they are
 made from their peels pine bark sources are available as well

 About 90 of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency 
 with the average daily dosage needed being about 1  2000mg
 For major complaints 4  6000mgday is common
 
 In case they cannot be taken because of their size and taste they
 are big and they dont taste that great a product made from pine 
 bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
 small and taste much better however the cost is about seven times
 higher for the equivalent effect One 25mg tablet of the pine bark
 extract gives you about the same effect as 1000mg of bioflavonoids
 The name for the pine bark product is Pycnogenol
  
   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are
 
   Quest1000mg   big bitter not chewable
   Swiss Herbal600mg   smooth easier swallowing 
   Jamieson500mg   medium bitter chewable 

   SISU25mg   Pycnogenol small easy swallowing
 
   Give them a try and see what happensand good luck
