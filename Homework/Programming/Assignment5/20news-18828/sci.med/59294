Hmm  This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack
therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
laetrile whether licensed or not as a quack  There are unethical
behaviors such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees
which I would not lable as quackish but prescribing known ineffective
therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack
