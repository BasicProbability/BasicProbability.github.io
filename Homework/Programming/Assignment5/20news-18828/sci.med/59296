So if you have any evidence against the hypothesis  for example
controlled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals dont do any
better than sugar water  then lets hear it  If you dont then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject
disbelief on the other

I dont have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS 
Im sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does  Do you really think
that in the absence of a doubleblind study I should be indifferent
to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS

For what its worth I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin
for candida hypersensitivity syndrome  It was published in the 
New England Journal I think 1990 and showed no benefit on systemic
symptoms though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections not
surprisingly  As I recall the yeast crowd had some major objections
to the study though I dont remember what they were
