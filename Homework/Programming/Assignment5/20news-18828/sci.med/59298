  Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods resident    in  
  the seas surrounding the antarctic Or pictures taken by them perhaps

 No flame intended but youre way way off base In simple terms Kirilian
 photography registers the electromagnetical fields around objects in simple
 it takes pictures of your aura

No flame intended but I think you just missed one of the rare attempts of
humor in sciskeptic
Krillean against Kirilian Get it


BTW I think youre a bit of base yourself since to my knowledge the
electromagnetic field around a stone is rather abscent But still a stone
has a nice aura on the Kirilian photographs

Dont remember excactly but corona discharge I think is a more fitting
expression than aura Think youll find something on this in the skepticfaq
