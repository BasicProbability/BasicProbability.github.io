Poor persons Kirlian Photography try this at home

1 Hold your hand up to a cold window
2 Look closely at the stunning corona effects around
   your fingertips
3 Remove hand from window and observe after image  
4 Invent crackpot theory to explain the effect

Advanced Kirlian Photography try this at home too

1  Get a camera
2  Have your subject face you with hisher back to the sun
3  Take photo
4  Observe the glow behind their silhouetted image on the photo
5  Invent crackpot theory to explain the effect
