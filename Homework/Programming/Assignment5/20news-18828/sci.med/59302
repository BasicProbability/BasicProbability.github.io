 sale but I dont know any of the companies Any info is greatly
 appreciated
 
 Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods resident in 
 the seas surrounding the antarctic Or pictures taken by them perhaps

No flame intended but youre way way off base In simple terms Kirilian
photography registers the electromagnetical fields around objects in simple
it takes pictures of your aura

Greg  Flame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects
