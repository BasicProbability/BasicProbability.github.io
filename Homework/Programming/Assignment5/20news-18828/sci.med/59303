As for how foods taste  If Im not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it why shouldnt I use it  Saying I shouldnt use
it is like saying I shouldnt eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer

Julie it doesnt necessarily follow that you should use it MSG or
something else for that matter simply because you are not allergic
to it For example you might not be allergic to animal fats and
like their taste yet it doesnt follow that you should be using them
regularly MSG might have other bad or good I am not up on 
knowledge of MSG effects on your body in the long run maybe thats
reason enough not to use it 

Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms soya beans and brie cheese
which all have MSG in them  It occurs naturally

Im not going to quit eating something that I like just because
it might cause me trouble later or causes problems in some
people  I would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over
what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting
reports of what is goodbad for you

I may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me
Fine  Ive made my decision and I dont think its appropriate
for anyone to try to convert me  Its for your own good are
the most obnoxious and harmful words IMO in the English or
any other language


Altho your example of the ulcer is funny it isnt an
appropriate comparison at all

I think it is  I get tired of people saying dont eat X because
its BAD  Well X may not be bad for everyone  And even if
it is so what  Give people all the information but dont ram
your decisions down their throats
