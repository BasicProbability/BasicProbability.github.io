 Krillean photography involves taking pictures of minute decapods
 resident in the seas surrounding the antarctic Or pictures taken by
 them perhaps

 No flame intended but youre way way off base In simple terms
 Kirilian photography registers the electromagnetical fields around
 objects in simple it takes pictures of your aura

	Greg no flame intended but you have no discernible sense of
humor  What Bill wrote was intended to be funny  Its called a
joke Greg  Look into it
	Besides Kirilian photography is actually photography of my
friends twoyearold son Kiril  Perhaps you meant Kirlian
