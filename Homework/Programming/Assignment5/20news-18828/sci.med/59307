 An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as gumbo file
 This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves  This
 is not only a natural product but a natural product still in its natural
 form so maybe thats how they evade Delany  Or maybe a special exemption
 was made to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats

One possible reason is that file is made with sassafras leaves while root
beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark  The leaves contain either
no
or less saffrole than the bark

There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from
sassafras products  I have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which
is
claimed to have the saffrole removed

 I think what we have to keep in mind is that even though it may be illegal to
 commercially producesell food with carcinogenic substances it is not illegal
 for people to do such to their own food smoking etc  Is this true

Well the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make 
root beer there was a sign saying that it wasnt sold for human
consumption
Also when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen
bark
she made a point of telling me that I couldnt buy sassafras for human 
consumption

I find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile
live
in fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny in a sick way
