From Nigeldatamandemoncouk Nigel Ballard
Subject Re Mind Machines 


I use a ZYGON Mind Machine as bought in the USA last year  Although
its no wonder cure for what ails you  It is however VERY good at
stopping you thinking

Sound strange  Well suppose youre tired and want to go to bedsleep
BUT your head is full of niggling problems to resolve you lay in the
bed and quickly they all come to the surface churning around from one
unresolved thing to the next and then back again  Been there bought
the tshirt

I slip on the Zygon and select a soothing pattern of light  sound and
quickly I just cant concentrate on the previous stuff Your brains
cache kinda gets flushed and you start on a whole new set of stuff

A useful addition is the facility to feed the output of a tape player
or CD through the box I use New Age elevator muzak to enhance the
overall effect

DEFFO better than a pill

Cheers Nigel
