synopsis Young man with inguianl hernia on one side repaired now has
new hernia on other side  What gives he asks  and he continues 
 Of course my wife thinks its from sitting for long periods of time at
 the computer reading news

There is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing
chronic straining which has caused the bowel movements  The classic 
problems that are supposed to be looked for in someone with a hernia are
constipation chronic cough colon cancer and youre not too young for
that and sitting for long periods of time at the computer reading news

Good Luck with your surgery
