Subject Celery and Hypertension

Somewhere or other I read that when a person of Chinese heritage was
told that he had high blood pressure he responded by eating celery
sorry I dont recall the dosage  Apparently this is supposed to
work in reducing hypertension

Can anyone out there verify this  And if it does work does anyone
know the appropriate amounts and possible sideeffects

Thanks
