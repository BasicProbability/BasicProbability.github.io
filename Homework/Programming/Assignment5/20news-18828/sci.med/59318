are in a different class  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics

I guess Im still not clear on what the term candida bloom means
but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use
This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack
diagnosis that has been being discussed


found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams

Lucky how  Since a recent article randomized controlled trial of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis Ive mentioned to a 
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily  It turns out most would
rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections

yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline

Again this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed
There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea but I dont think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy
