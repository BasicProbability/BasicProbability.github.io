Subject Discussions on altpsychoactives
Date 20 Apr 1993 191625 GMT
 
Could the people discussing recreational drugs such as mj lsd mdma etc
take their discussions to altdrugs Their discussions will receive greatest
contribution and readership there The people interested in strictly
smart drugs ie Nootropics should post to this group The two groups
altdrugs  altpsychoactives have been used interchangably lately
I do think that altpsychoactives is a deceiving name altpsychoactives
is supposedly the smart drug newsgroup according to newsgroup lists on
the Usenet Should we establish an altnootropics or altsdn smart drugs 
nutrients I have noticed some posts in scimednutrition regarding
smart nutrients We may lower that groups burden as well

I beg to disagree with you on this subject  If I recall correctly
altdrugs was being flodded by posts like how do I grow MJ How do I
use a bong wow man I just had the coolest trip etc  There were
quite a few people out there who were versed in pharmacology and biology
who wanted to discuss centrally active substabces at a higher level
without all the other crap filling the bandwidth    I would suggest
that you proceed to create a newsgroup dedicated to Nootropics if you
must have one dedicated to them and leave altpsychoactives to the
discussion of psychoactives including nootropics which are but a small
portion of the realm of centrally active substances

I was wondering if a group called scipharmacology would be relevent
This would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological
issues pharmacodynamics neuropharmacology etc

Just an informal proposal I dont know anything about the netpolitics
for adding a newsgroup etc

more altpsychoactives stuff deleted
