Subject PMSCan It Be Prevented By A Diet Change

This question came up in Sci Med Nutrition and Im posting my answer 
here  Only 22 medical schools in the US teach courses on human 
nutrition  We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do 
when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community
I think that the best example of where US medicine is really missing the 
mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS  So many womenand 
their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that 
most physicians in the US are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by 
diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening  Before shooting 
your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is 
justified

From A Poster In Sci Medi Nutrition
 	In a psychological anthropology course I am taking we got 
 sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS  Some rumors shared
 by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar
 intake and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms
 	Is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey
 
 Many thanks
 
 Michael Ive wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got 
sidetracked with candida  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms most 
physicians dont recognize it as a specific disease entity  Here is 
everything that you would ever want to know about PMS

Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups

	PMTAAnxiety		PMTDdepression
	anxiety			depression
	irritability		forgetfulness
	insomnia		confusion
	depression		lethargy

	PMTCCraving		PMTHHyperhydration
	craving for sweets	weight gain
	increased appetite	breast congestion and tenderness
	sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness
	 1 headache		edema of the face and extremities
	 2 palpitations
	 3 fatigue or fainting
 
PMTA is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low 
progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a womens cycle

PMTC is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple 
carbohydrates  During the luteal phase of a womens cycle there is 
increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose 
challenge  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMTC are 
a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1  This condition of hypoglycemia 
is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of 
hypoglycemia magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia
	A Am J Psychiatry 1474477801990
Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium 
supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementationincreased to 56 of 
the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources 
of alpha linoleic acid

PMTD is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase of a womens cycle  Another cause of PMTD has been found to be lead 
toxicityin women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal 
phase Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human 
endometrial cystol Fertil Steril 28312181972

PMTH is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated 
serum aldosterone level  Salt restriction B6 magnesium and vitamin E 
for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMTH

This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form

	    a nutritional approach 1986 A Year in Nutritional Medicine

Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can 
find a doctor who will treat you for PMSjust about as hard as finding one 
that will treat you for candida blooms  While progesterone will work 
supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better  There really 
has been an awful lot of research done on PMSmuch more than candida 
blooms  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental 
controlled studiesthe type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to 
see done

Here are a few of these studies

	CARBOHYDRATE Experimental Controlled Study Effect of a lowfat 
	highcarbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy Lancet 
	2128321988  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy 
	of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive 
	specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15 of total calories 
	and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary 
	advise with no training  After 6 months there was a significant 
	reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in 
	the trained group as reported by selfreported symptoms as well as 
	physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling 
	tenderness and nodularity

	VITAMIN A Experimental Controlled Study The use of Vitamin A in 
	premenstrual tension Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand 39586921960  
	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200000 to 300000IU 
	vitamin A daily or a placebo  Serum retinol levels were monitored 
	and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of 
	toxicity occuredserum retinol above 450ugml  The intent of the 
	study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool 
	size500000IU to 1000000IU and then see if this 
	normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS  48 getting the high dose 
	vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS  Only 10 
	getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms
  	10 of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS 
	symptoms

	Experimental Controlled Study Premenstrual tension treated with 
	vitamin A J Clinical Endocrinology 101579891950 30 pts 
	received 200000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their 
	cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms
  	After 26 months all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in 
	PMS symptoms  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of 
	toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year 
	after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped  PMS symptoms 
	did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the 
	vitamin A supplementation was stopped

Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver  
These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal 
store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS  Of all the vitamins 
given for PMSvitamin A B6 and vitamin E vitamin A has shown the best 
single effect  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid 
estrogenprogesterone metabolism in the liver  Getting your liver full 
of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent 
the symptoms of PMS  But vitamin A is toxic and you dont want to be trying 
to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin 
A toxicity

	VITAMIN B6 Experimental Doubleblind Crossoverr Study Pyridoxine
	vitamin B6 and the premenstrual syndrome A randomized crossover 
	trialJR Coll Gen Pract 39364681989  32 women aged 1849 
	with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo
  	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 
	3 months  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of 
	PMSdepression irritability and tiredness  Other symptoms of PMS 
	were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation

	Experimental Doubleblind Study The efects of vitamin B6 
	supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms Obstet Gynecol 
	702145491987  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 
	150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months  Analysis of convergence 
	showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related 
	to the autonomic nervous systemdizziness and vomiting as well as 
	behavior changespoor mental performance decreased social interaction
  	Anxiety depression and water retention were not improved by B6 
	supplementation

Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women  Birth control 
pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man  
Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 1015 mg of B6 per 
day  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear  Dr David R 
Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in 
Clin Psychiatry News December 1987 as stating that B6 should be 
considered the firstline drug for PMSover progesterone and if the 
patient does not respond then other treatments should be tried  Vitamin 
B6 can be toxicnerve damage if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each 
day 


	VITAMIN E Experimental Doubleblind Study Efficacy of alpha
	tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome J Reprod 
	Med 326400041987 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 
	cycles or a placebo  Vitamin E treated pts had 33 who reported a 
	significant reduction in physical symptomsweight gain and breast 
	tenderness while the placebo group had 14 who reported a significant
 	reduction in physical symptoms The vitamin E group reported that 38 
	had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12 for the placebo 
	group  For depression the vitamin E group had 27 with a significant
	decrease in depression compared with 8 for the placebo group

	Experimental Doubleblind Study The effect of alphatocopherol on 
	premenstrual symptomalogy A double blind study J Am Coll Nutr 
	221151221983 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly 
	received vitamin E at 75IU 150IU or 300IU daily or placebo  After 
	2 months of supplementation 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly 
	improved PMTA and PMTC  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly 
	improve PMTD  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMTH
	other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve 
	PMTH symptoms
	
	MAGNESIUM Experimental Doubleblind Study Magnesium prophylaxis 
	of menstrual migraine effects on itracellular magnesium Headache 
	312983041991 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg 
	daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a 
	placebo  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and 
	continued until menstruation After 2 months the Pain Total Index 
	was significantly lower in the magnesium group  Magnesium treatment 
	was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual 
	Distress Questionnaire scores  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  
	lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower 
	in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer 
	from PMS  After treatment magnesium levels in these cells was raised 
	into the normal range

	Experimental Doubleblind Study Oral Magnesium successfully 
	relieves premenstrual mood changes Obstet Gynecol 782177811991 
	32pts aged 2439 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 
	360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the 
	onset of the menstrual flow  After 2 cycles both groups received 
	magnesium  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster 
	pain was significantly reduced during the second cyclemonth for the 
	magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were 
	switched to magnesium supplementation  In addition the total score on 
	the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by 
	magnesium supplementation  The authors suggest that magnesium 
	supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes 
	that occur during PMS

There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the 
medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder 
that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature  But 
since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci Med 
to be anecdotal in nature I have not bothered to cite them  There are 
also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on 
multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS  Ive chosen the 
best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out 
that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder  But doctors dont recognize 
nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathologyberiberi 
pellagra scruvy etc  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor 
being trained in the US should get a good course on human nutrition  PMS 
is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional 
disorders  Its time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses

Heres some studies which show the importance in multivitaminmineral 
supplementation andor diet change in preventing PMS

	Experimental Study Effect of a nutritional programme on 
	premenstrual syndrome a retrospective analysis Complement Med 
	Res518111991  200pts were given dietary instructions and 
	supplemented with OptiviteR plus additional vitamin C vitamin E 
	magnesium zinc and primrose oil  The dietary instructions were to 
	take the supplements and switch to a low fat complex carbohydrate 
	diet  On a retrospective analysis 965 of the 200pts reported an 
	improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30 of the sample stating that 
	they no longer suffered from PMS 


	Experimental Doubleblind Study Role of Nutrition in managing 
	premenstrual tension syndromes J Reprod Med 326405221987  
	A low fat high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite 
	supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet 
	change and placebo  After 6 months on the experimental program the 
	vitaminmineral supplementated group had significantly decreased 
	estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel 
	phase of their cycle

	Experimental Doubleblind Study Clinical and biochemical effects 
	of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome J 
	Reprod Med 326435411987 119pts randomly given Optivite12 
	tablets per day or a placebo  The treated groups showed a 
	significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo  Another
 	group of 104pts got Optivite4 tablets per day or placebo  For this 
	second group of patients no significant effect of supplementation on 
	PMS symptoms was observed
