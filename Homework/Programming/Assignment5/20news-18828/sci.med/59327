Subject Re Krillean Photography

GregFlame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects

True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
corona discharge



 
THAT is a DRY turtle  That turtle is NOT moist
