Subject Theophyllineephedrine and water bioavailability

Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine or the two in
combination can reduce the bodys ability to make use of 
available water  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike
recently becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous
hiking despite having brought 1 12 gallons of water c 6 liters
I drank close to twice as much as anyone else and no one else was
dehydrated  I dont think general physical condition was an issue
since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
stamina so far as I could tell

It may be that I just plain need more water than most people  But I am
wondering if theophylline andor ephedrine might be aggravating things
I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma
24 mg ephedrine 100 mg theophylline  I gather that both those
drugs are diuretics  So now Im wondering does that mean they can
reduce the bodys ability to utilize available water  Would it be a
particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hotweather
exercise  I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot but
that wasnt the case yesterday
