 Does anyone here know anything about chelation therapy using EDTA  My
 uncle has emphesema and a doctor wants to try it on him  We are
 wondering if
 
 1  Is there any evidence EDTA chelation therapy is beneficial for his
 condition or any condition
 
 2  What possible side effects are there  How can they be mimimized
 
 Please respond via email to    rme1cornelledu
 
 Thanks

EDTAchelation therapy has been used by some physicians to try to remove 
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial systemnot approved for such 
use  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung 
disease has become calcifiedchest xrays would show this  There are side
effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calciumit also 
binds other minerals  I think that there have been some deaths when 
EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that 
were not detected and corrected  In animal studies the best way to remove 
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C 
and magnesiumrabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C the extra 
vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium 
from the plaques

The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably 
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form  Most patietns 
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium

	1 Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease A review
	   Am J Clin Nutr 27159791974  Supplementation with 
	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels 

	2 The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular 
	    disease Am Heart J 94649571977  The need to measure the 
	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be 
	    overemphasized  This is a review article

	3 Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis 
	   in cholesterolfed rabbits Atherosclerosis 1073271990  
	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of 
	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1 by weight cholesterrol 
	   added to their normal food

Since EDTA will also bind magnesium Ive never really liked its use for 
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients
