are in a different class  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that could be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broadspectrum antibiotics
 
 I guess Im still not clear on what the term candida bloom means
 but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal
 infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use
 This has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack
 diagnosis that has been being discussed
 
 
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC antifungal creams
 
 Lucky how  Since a recent article randomized controlled trial of
 oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis Ive mentioned to a 
 number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
 could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily  It turns out most would
 rather just use antifungal creams when they get yeast infections
 
yogurt dangerous  If this were a standard part of medical practice as 
Gordon R says it is then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline
 
 Again this just isnt what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and
 has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed
 There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with
 bacteria after antibiotic therapy dont seem to be very helpful in
 reducing diarrhea but I dont think anyone would view this as a
 quack therapy

Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L bulgaricus  L 
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily 
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free  Most of 
the commercial yogurt sold in the US has a very low L acidophilus and L 
bulgaricus count  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem  Gordon R has told 
me through email that he gives his patients L acidophilus and several 
different obligate anaerobeswhich setup shop in the colon but he hasnt 
told me which ones yet  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative 
anaerobes and will setup shop where they have access to oxygen if given a 
chancemouth anus sinus cavity and vagina  Having these good bacteria 
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal 
region or the vagina  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida 
blooms  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from 
the evil yeast blooms in the body  Im not ready to buy that yet  I do 
believe that complications at specific sitesvagina anal and maybe lower 
colon sinus and mouth can result from antibiotic use which removes the 
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked
Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best wayin my opinion to get 
rid of the problem  Antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out
