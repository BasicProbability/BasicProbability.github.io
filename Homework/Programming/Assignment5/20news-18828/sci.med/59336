Subject Re Frozen shoulder and lawn mowing

 Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year  It is still
 partially frozen and I am still in physical therapy every week  But the
 pain has subsided almost completely  UNTIL last week when I mowed the
 lawn for twenty minutes each two days in a row  I have a push type power
 mower  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite
 a while and I used ice and medicine again  Can anybody explain why this
 particular activity which does not seem to stress me very much generally
 should cause this shoulder problem

You need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower If you havent been
doing much exercise as I suppose you havent then a constant 20 minute
long effort can cause stiffness and cramps
