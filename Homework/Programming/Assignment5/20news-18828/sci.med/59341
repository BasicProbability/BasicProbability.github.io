Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem

THE diarrhea problem  WHAT diarrhea problem  First candidal overgrowth is
not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy and not all cases of
antibioticrelated diarrhea have anything to do with candida  But a case
of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isnt going
to surprise anyone either  Thats not what people are disagreeing with

Antifungals a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out

Oh really  Whered you come up with this  You know its really
appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters
in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature
Bobbing for citations in the research literature isnt medicine
I hope youre not giving the wrong idea to your medical students
