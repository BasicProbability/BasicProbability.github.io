 GregFlame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
 Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
 involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
 subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
 with inanimate objects

 True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
 corona discharge

No Its called not wiping off the apparatus after taking a picture of the
whole leaf
