Subject Re Is MSG sensitivity superstition

 MSG is common in many food we eat including Chinese though some oriental
 restaurants might put a tad too much in them  Ive noticed that when I
 go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants I will usually get
 a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards  This happens to many
 of my friends and relatives too  And heh we eat Chinese food all the
 time at home  but we dont use MSG when were cooking for ourselves

        Heck I seem to feel like that every time I eat out Including 
in the cafeteria at work About half the time the headache intensifies 
until nothing will make it go away except throwing up Ick

        As you might imagine I dont eat out a lot I guess my tolerance 
for food additives has plummeted since I switched to eating mostly 
steamed veggies Theyre easy to fix thats all

        I wont even mention what happened the last time I ate corned 
beef Oops Too late
