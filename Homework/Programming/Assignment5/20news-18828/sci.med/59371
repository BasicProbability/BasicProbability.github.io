First off if Im not mistaken only hibernating animals have brown fat
not humans

Secondly your description sounds just like 24dinitrophenol  This is an
uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation  Put in laymans
terms it shortcircuits the mitochondria causing food energy to be
turned into heat

24DNP was popular in the 1930s for weight reduction  In controlled
amounts it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the
reduced amount of useful energy available  It is very dangerous
It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form rather than
play around with 24DNP

But if you insist I suggest you look up the literature in your own
university library  You can obtain 24DNP by taking a first year
organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies its
a commonlyused reagent
