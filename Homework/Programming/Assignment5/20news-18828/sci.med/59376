Subject INFO Colonics and Purification

Recently Ive come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition  In
particular Dr Bernard Jenssen in his book Colon Cleansing for
Health and Longevity  the title actually escapes me but it is very
similar to that  claims that regular selfadministered colonics
along with certain orally ingested debrisloosening agents boosts
the immune system to a significant degree

He also plugs a unique appliance called the Colema Board which
facilitates the selfadministration of colonics  It sells for over
100 from a Californiabased company  He also plugs VitraTox
products as his chemical agents of choice these include volcanic ash
supposedly for its electrical charge and psyllium powder for its
bulkiness

If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory its
particulars or the Colema Board and related products Id be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience

This article is crossposted to altmagick as the issue touches upon
fasting and cleansing through a ritual system of purification
