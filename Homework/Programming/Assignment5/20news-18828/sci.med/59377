I heard that a certain disease toxoplasmosys is transmitted by cats which
can harm the unborn fetus Does anybody know about it Is it a problem to 
have a cat in the same apartment

The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis  It is a protozoan that 
lives and multiplies within cells  In cats the protozoan multiplies in the
intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cats feces  The protozoa can
cross the placenta to infect the fetus  The disease may be asymptomatic
after the baby is born or it may be very severe  Toxo may cause blindness
and mental retardation

Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem however pregnant
women should not scoop or change the cats litterbox  In addition whoever
does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash hisher hands before handling
anything else especially food

Information came from The Merck Manual 15th Ed

I hope this information is helpful to you
