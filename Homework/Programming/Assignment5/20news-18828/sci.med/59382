GregFlame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects

True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
corona discharge

Yup  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates and taking a Kirlian photograph of it  You then cut off part of
the leaf put the top plate back on and take another Kirlian photograph  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases  Turns out the effect isnt
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity  Surprise surprise

understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
