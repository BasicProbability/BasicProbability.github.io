   Isnt there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving
   a noninvasive use of ultrasound where the patient is lowered
   into some sort of liquid when heshe undergoes treatment Im sure
   Ive read about it somewhere If I remember it correctly it is a
   painless and effective treatment
   A couple of weeks ago I visited a hospital here in Stockholm and
   saw big signs showing the way to the Kidney stone chrusher 

I saw this a few years ago on Tomorrows World lowbrow BBC
technology news program  The patient is lowered into a bath of
deionized water and carefully positioned  High intensity pressure
waves are generated by an electric spark in the water you dont get
electrocuted because deionised water does not conduct  These waves are
focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to
break up  This is completely painless

Of course you then have to get these little bits of gravel through
the urethra  Ouch
