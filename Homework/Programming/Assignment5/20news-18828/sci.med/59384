Subject Re Use of haldol in elderly

In article westesC60xqF59rnetcomcom westesnetcomcom Will Estes writes
Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly  Does 
shortterm use of the drug ever produce longterm sideeffects after
the use of the drug  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks  Although the
drug has been terminated she has changed from a perky slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance  It
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and onehalf months  I have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drugs are in part
catalysts for this  Any comments

Haldol one of the wonder drugs that works wonders  If youre a carrot that
is
