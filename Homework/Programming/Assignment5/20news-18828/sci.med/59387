FLAME ON

Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling
photography I couldnt help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrowminded I know it all I dont believe what I cant see or
measure attitude of many people out there

I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as Im concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something ANYTHING simply because it doesnt fit your current frame
of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

Especially the USA should be grateful after all Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth

FLAME OFF or end sermon
