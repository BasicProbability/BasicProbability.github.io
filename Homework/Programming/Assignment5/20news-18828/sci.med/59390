Subject Vasectomy Health Effects on Women
From eskagerbnermalsantarosaedu Eric Skagerberg

Does anyone know of any studies done on the longterm health effects of a
mans vasectomy on his female partner

Ive seen plenty of study results about vasectomys effects on mens health
but what about women 

For example might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for
say cervical cancer  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies  Changes in the
vaginas pH  Yeast or bacterial infections

Outside of study results how about informed speculation

Thanks in advance for your help
