    Isnt there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving
    a noninvasive use of ultrasound where the patient is lowered
    into some sort of liquid when heshe undergoes treatment Im sure
    Ive read about it somewhere If I remember it correctly it is a
    painless and effective treatment
The use of shock waves not ultrasound to break up stones has been
around for a few years  Depending on the type of machine and intensity
of the shock waves it is usually uncomfortable enough to require
something  The highpower machines cause enough pain to require
general or regional anesthesia  Afterwards it feels like someone
slugged you pretty good
