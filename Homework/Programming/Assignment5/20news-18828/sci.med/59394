Subject Re Resound Hearing aids and others

 I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss A recent rough test
 showed a gently sloping loss to 1020db down at 1000cps Then it falls off
 a cliff to 7080dbs down from 1500cps on  This type of loss is difficult
 to fit I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which
 keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired
 
 Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for
 several weeks These have four independent programs which are intended to
 be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed I
 found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
 to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
 another programmable system called ReSound
 
 Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for
 about 30 minutes and I couldnt compare them head to head with the Widex
 Nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and I was
 impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I
 will give in a separate posting They also carry the Widex aids and had one
 patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound
 even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago
 
 The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the
 Widex and other programmable aids I could take a trip to Europe on the
 difference  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money I am
 having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds I would
 appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections
 about when and if I might see improvements in technology that arent quite
 so expensive
 
 

Your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine thanks Uncle Sam  Ive been
wearing Miracle Ear canal aids for about 5 months now and I find them to be
acceptable  They are molded to the shape of your ear canal and tuned to 
your hearing curve  They are comfortable to wear and almost invisible if
youre worried about that although if youre currently wearing behind the
ear models thats not an issue  The cost  I paid 1200 each for mine
through the Miracle Ear counter at Sears  Ive heard that there is a
substantial discount for senior citizens but I havent researched that because
Im not a senior citizen yet

Give them a try you might be pleasantly surprised
