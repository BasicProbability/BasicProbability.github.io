GregFlame definitely intended here  Bill was making fun of the misspelling 
Go look up the word krill  Also the correct spelling is Kirlian  It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects

True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
corona discharge
 
Yup  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates and taking a Kirlian photograph of it  You then cut off part of
the leaf put the top plate back on and take another Kirlian photograph  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases  Turns out the effect isnt
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity  Surprise surprise

	This is true but its not quite the whole story  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the phantom leaf effect

    One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography
    is a Theosophist and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
    hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura electromagnetic
    or otherwise professor of electrical engineering at Londons
    City University and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research 
    named A J Ellison

    After years of studying the method and the claims Ellison
    came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
    calls Lichtenberg Figures an effect of intermittent ionization of
    the air around the object  Its a bit more complicated than
    not wiping off the plates but it comes down to the same thing
    in the end Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
    value if any than was previously widely thought  Electrical and
    magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
    of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
    usually also tracer chemicals
