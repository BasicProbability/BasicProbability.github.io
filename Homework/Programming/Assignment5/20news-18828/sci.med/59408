Subject Re Iridology  Any credence to it

Iridology is descendant from a 19thcentury theory which mapped certain
diseases to sectors of the iris of the eye  Theres enough natural
variation in color that a skilled examiner can find indicators of
virtually any disease

Modern scientists consider it to be complete bunk
