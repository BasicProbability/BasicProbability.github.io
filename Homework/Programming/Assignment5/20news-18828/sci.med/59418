Subject Re Krillean Photography

In article 1rk5miINNkjuusenetpadeccom starkdwovaxenetdeccom Todd I Stark writes
Yup  The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates and taking a Kirlian photograph of it  You then cut off part of
the leaf put the top plate back on and take another Kirlian photograph  You
see pretty much the same image in both cases  Turns out the effect isnt
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs  Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity  Surprise surprise

	This is true but its not quite the whole story  There were 
	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
	who also replicated the phantom leaf effect

You can also replicate the effect with a rock  Take your first Kirlian
photograph  Then moisten one edge of the rock  Lo and behold  Phantom rock

understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
