 It
involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a highvoltage source not of some aura  It works equally well
with inanimate objects

True but what about showing the missing part of a leaf  Is this
corona discharge

This effect disappears if you clean your apparatus after you kirlianed
the whole leaf and before kirlianing the leaf part
