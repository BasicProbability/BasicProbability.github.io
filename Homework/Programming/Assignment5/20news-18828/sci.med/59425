I get tired of people saying dont eat X because
its BAD  Well X may not be bad for everyone  And even if
it is so what  Give people all the information but dont ram
your decisions down their throats


It is evident you did not read my post carefully I wasnt
trying to tell you not to eat MSG products and produce nor was I
arguing for or against MSG I was simply questioning the logic of
your statement that simply because
a one is not allergic to something and
b likes eating that
it follows that one could keep eating whatever it is 
In my post I had clearly said that I dont know enough about MSG
The statement dont eat X because its bad is just your 
interpretation of nutritional info out there
