Subject Miscelaneous soontohavebaby questions

Were about to have our first baby and have a few questions that we
dont seem to be able to get answered to our satisfaction 

Reguarding having a baby boy circumsized what are the medical pros
and cons  All weve heard is its up to the parents

How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water  Weve heard 
stories of infection etc  How about after the water has broken
