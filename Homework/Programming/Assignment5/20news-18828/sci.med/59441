 Someone please help me I am searching to find out as many others may
an absolute cure to removing all detectable traces of marijuana from
a persons body Is there a chemical or natural substance that can be
ingested or added to urine to make it undetectable in urine analysis
If so where can these substances be found 

You could do what I do never go near the stuff
