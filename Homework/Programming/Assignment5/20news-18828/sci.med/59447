B   increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is
B   restricting calcium intake

 Marty I personally wouldnt be so quick and take that NEJM article 
 on kidney stones as gospel First of all I would want to know who
 sponsored that study
 I have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from
 local newspapers magazines to TVguide with disclaimers on the
 bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
 compliments of the Dairy Industries
 There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
 financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
 benefits of increasing ones calcium intake

 Secondly were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
 in that project analysed for their chemical composition  The study
 didnt say that it only claimed that most kidney stones are large
 ly calcium
 Perhaps it wont be long before another study comes up with the exact
 opposite findings A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
 are oftentimes just plain wrong It wouldnt be the first time
 
 Sodiummagnesiumcalciumphosphorus ratios are in my opinion still 
 the most reliable indicators for the cause treatment and prevention 
 of kidney stones
 I for one will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
 ones diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
 stones of either type and they definitely wont include an INCREASE
 in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
 type and peoples chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
 from a PHOSPHORUSraising approach instead
