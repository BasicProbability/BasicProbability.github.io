From pchurchswellactrixgennz Pat Churchill

I am currently in the throes of a hay fever attack  SO who certainly
never reads Usenet let alone Scimed said quite spontaneously 
There are a lot of mushrooms and toadstools out on the lawn at the
moment  Sure thats not your problem

Well who knows  Or maybe its the sourdough bread I bake

After reading learned semilearned possibly ignorant and downright
ludicrous stuff in this thread I am about ready to believe anything 

If the hayfever gets any worse maybe I will cook those toadstools

 

            The floggings will continue until morale improves
