Subject Re feverfew for migraines

In article ltrdroINNltfexodusEngSunCOM brendabookhouseEngSunCOM Brenda Bowden writes

Does anyone know about these studies Or have experience with feverfew
Im skeptical but open to trying it if I can find out more about this
What is feverfew and how much would you take to prevent migraines if 
this is a good idea that is Are there any known risks or side effects
of feverfew 

Thanks in advance for any info
Brenda

Ive tried it and so has one friend of mine  No known side effects or
risks  It didnt seem to work for us but several studies now have 
suggested it does work for many people so I think its worth a try

You can find it in capsule form at health food stores  Up to six capsules
a day was recommended if I remember correctly  It can also be prepared 
as a tea

Good luck

John
