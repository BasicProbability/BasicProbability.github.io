Ive already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didnt
really help them

I am a moderately severe asthmatic  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved

Did your ENT also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles
of your feet and improve your sex life

Actually severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses plugged ostia are
possible and sinus surgery which widens the ostia  from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm  should relieve this  There are nonsurgical ways
however to keep the ostia open however in a few individuals their
ostia are naturally very small and Dr Ivkers book talks about this
The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of
sinus surgery though

About asthma thats a little more controversial  Dr Ivker in his book
Sinus Survival speculates and says its not proven that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
postnasal drip from the sinuses  Hes had many patients whove found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated 
not clinical proof but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation

Before doing any sinus surgery first get THE BOOK  it discusses surgery
as well as a good nonsurgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis
