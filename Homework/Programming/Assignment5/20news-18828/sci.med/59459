Subject Re Kidney Stones

 A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones a
 cyst on one kidney and a kidney infection  She was upset because her
 condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall and she has been ill all
 this time  During her most recent doctors appointment at her parents
 HMO clinic she said that about FORTY xrays were made of her kidney
 When she asked why so many xrays were being made she was told by a
 technician that they need to see the area from different views but she
 says that about five xrays were made from EACH angle  She couldnt help
 feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something  She
 is a premed student and feels she could have understood what was
 happening if someone would have explained  When nobody would she got
 worried
 	Also she is told that thre are 300 surgery patients ahead of her
 and that they cannot do surgery until August or so  It is now April
 She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids  But she has to go to
 classes  She wonders why they have given her no medicine  She plans to
 call back her doctors office  clinic and try to get answers to these
 questions  But I told her I would also write in to scimed and see what I
 could find out about why there were so many xrays and whether it seems
 ok to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this
 or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care  She does plan to
 get a second opinion too 
 
 	I will pass info on to her  It never hurts to get information
 from more than one source  
 
 You can email me or post
 
 Thanks

My opinionfor what its worth is that 40 xrays is way too many  
Guidleines have been set on the number of dental xrays and chest xrays 
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiation 
is one of the most potentsplits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical 
formation in tissue cells  Ultasoundlike that used in seeing the fetus 
in the uterus has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder  But kidney tissue may 
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stonesany radiologists care 
to comment

Most stones will passbut its a very painful process  Unlike gallstones 
I dont think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the 
kidney stonewhich is probably calciumoxalate  Vitamin C and magnesium 
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
aterial wall  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
speed up the process of kidney stone passagebut Im pretty confident that 
a diet change andor supplementation can prevent a reoccurance  If surgery 
is being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule  A second 
opinion is a good idea because there are betterless damaging ways to break 
up the stone if its logged within the kidneysonic blasts  HMOs are 
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments
