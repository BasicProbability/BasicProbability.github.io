Do I ever  After 2 years of having health problems that had been
cleared up wallery shots and not knowing why I went and was retested
I actually did better than when I had been tested 2 years ago
Then putting 2  2 together I realized that it all started back up
when the laser printer came into the office  I kept track of the usage and
on hi use days I was worse  I got better over the weekends

The laser printer is gone Im 100 better Whether it is the toner
dust or chemicals I dont know I am highly allergic to dust but
it definitely was the laser printer
