Subject Vitamin B6 doses

Forgive me but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a
physicians posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B6  I cant
seem to locate the article but I recall there was mention of some safe
limits

I looked at a Balanced 100 time release formulation from Walgreens
and noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA  Is
this safe

Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for

Mail would be just fine if you dont want to clog the net

Thanks
