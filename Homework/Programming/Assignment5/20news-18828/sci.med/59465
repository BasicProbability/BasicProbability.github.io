	Besides Kirilian photography is actually photography of my
friends twoyearold son Kiril  Perhaps you meant Kirlian

I think it was a typo for Karelian photography which is the
practice of taking pictures of either Finns or Russians depending
on whom one asks

Think we can lose the sciimageprocessing group from this thread
folks

Thanks bunches
