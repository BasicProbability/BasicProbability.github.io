I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as Im concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

Oooooh  Bad example  Im an atheist

This is not flame or abuse nor do I want to start another thread this
is after all supposed to be about IMAGE PROCESSING

BUT to say youre an atheist is to suggest you have PROOF there is NO GOD
To be a politicallycorrect skeptic better to go with agnostic like me
