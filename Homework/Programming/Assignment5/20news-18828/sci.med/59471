 My wife had hives during the first two months
 of her pregnancy  My son 3 months old breastfed
 now has the same symptoms  She has been to a skinspecialist
 but he has merely prescribed various medicines one
 each visit as though by trial and error 
 
 Antihistamines worked on both of them but looks like
 becoming less effective
 
 Are there other solutions  Thanks

Food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the
young  Since the son is allergic it would be best not to go to
bottle feedings but rather eliminate foods from mothers diet  Your
pediatrician should be able to give you a list of foods to avoid

Good luck Steve
