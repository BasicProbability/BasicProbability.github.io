 My girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones She says that because she has no
 medical insurance she cannot get them removed
 
 My question Is there any way she can treat them herself or at least mitigate
 their effects Any help is deeply appreciated Advice referral to literature
 etc
 
 Thank you

First off I would consider the severity of the pain I had stones
several years ago and theres now way I could have made it without
heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
hospital I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would
dissolve them If the stones are passible the best thing she could do
is drink LOTS of water and hope that they pass but every time they
move a little the pain will be excrutiating I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth Yes
by a male doctor so Im sure some of you women will disagree Id
really like to know the truth in this so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in
