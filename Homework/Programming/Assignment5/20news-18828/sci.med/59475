Ive already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didnt
really help them

I am a moderately severe asthmatic  ENT doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery  Also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved



 Did your ENT also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles
 of your feet and improve your sex life



You probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal
obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine
hyperthyroidism asthma peptic ulcer dysmenorrhea and lack of libido

So before you post your inane comments it would be nice if youd run a MEDLINE
search on the topic say back to 1966 Theres been extensive literature on this
for over a 100 years

I may be in cardiology but Ive had a very good working relationship with
my colleagues from ENT
