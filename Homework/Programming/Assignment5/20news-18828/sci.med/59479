FLAME ON

Especially the USA should be grateful after all Columbus did not
drop off the edge of the earth

WITHCOUNTERFLAMEENABLED

 Columbus was indeed a crank but not in the manner you think

 The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail  It was
 also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles and that you could
 not reach Asia bo going west with current technology  you would neither be
 able to carry enough supplies nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing
 weather  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world  Instead
 they expected him to die at sea

 Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles
 making the trip practical

 Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates the Earths circumference is
 indeed 25K miles

 Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates there was a stopping place right
 about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles
