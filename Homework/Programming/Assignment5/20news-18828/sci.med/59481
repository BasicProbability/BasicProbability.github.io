Subject Epilepsy and video games

There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological 
esp neurological conditions induced by playing video games
eg Nintendo Apparently there have been reported several cases of
photosensitive epilepsy due to the flashing of some
patterns and the strong attention of the young players
One poster to comprisks reported some action from
the British Government

A quick search in a database reported the following two published
references

1 EJ Hart Nintendo epilepsy in New England J of Med 32220 1473
2 TK Daneshmend et al Dark Warrior epilepsy BMJ 1982 28417512

I would appreciate if someone could post or email 
any reference to preferably published further work on the subject
Any pointer to other information andor to possible technical tools 
if any for reducing the risks are appreciated

Many thanks
