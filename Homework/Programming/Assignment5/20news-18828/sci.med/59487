Subject Re HELP for Kidney Stones 

As I recall from my bout with kidney stones there isnt any
medication that can do anything about them except relieve the pain

Either they pass or they have to be broken up with sound or they have
to be extracted surgically

When I was in the Xray tech happened to mention that shed had kidney
stones and children and the childbirth hurt less

Demerol worked although I nearly got arrested on my way home when I barfed
all over the police car parked just outside the ER
