Subject Sumatripton spelling


I recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called sumatripton
I have no idea of the actual spelling that supposedly utilizes a chemical
that trips neurotransmitters  My mother has regular migraines and nothing
seems to help  does anyone know anything about this new drug  Is it in
a testing phaze or anywhere near approval  Does it seem to be working

Any information would help

Please feel free to email rather than take up bandwidth if you prefer

Thanks in advance
