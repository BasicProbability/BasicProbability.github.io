FLAME ON

Reading through the posts about Kirlian whatever spelling
photography I couldnt help but being slightly disgusted by the
narrowminded I know it all I dont believe what I cant see or
measure attitude of many people out there

	
I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
socalled paranormal stuff but as far as Im concerned it is just
as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

	Accepted by whom  People who think digital watches are a 
	real good idea  That 60 channels of television is 10x better 
	than 6 channels of television  

I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something ANYTHING simply because it doesnt fit your current frame
of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

	Youre right  Keep an open mind to the following

	1 Taco flavored donuts
	2 Cannibalism  Good way to get that extra protein in the diet
	3 Belief in Yawanga armadillo god of parking meters
