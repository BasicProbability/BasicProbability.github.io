move a little the pain will be excrutiating I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth Yes
by a male doctor so Im sure some of you women will disagree Id
really like to know the truth in this so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in 

Ive had neither a baby nor a kidney stone but according to my aunt 
who has had plenty of both a kidney stone is worse
