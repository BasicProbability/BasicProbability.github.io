 My wife has requested that I poll the Sages of Usenet to see what is
 known about the use of chromium in weightcontrol diet suppliments
 She has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind
 real information
 
 My first impulse was Yuck a metal but I have zero data on it
 
 What do you know

Ill tell you all that I know about chromium  But before I do I want to 
get a few things off my chest  I just got blasted in email for my kidney 
stone posts  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heart 
disease and cancer  When I give dietary advise it is not intended to 
encourage people reading this news groupor Sci Med Nutrition where I do 
most of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor  Nothing can be further from 
the truth  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to 
be ruled out  But once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance
Same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have 
a problem with one of these diseases dont use what Im going to tell you 
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor  You have to go
Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help 
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment 
programbut the odds are that you will not and thats why Im here  When 
my wife detected a lump in here breast I didnt say dont worry my vitamin 
E will take care of it  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician 
plan and simple  If its begninwhich most are fine then maybe a diet 
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring
But let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation 
and another lump returns get your butt into the doctors office as fast as 
your little feet can carry youbetter yet have a mammography done on a 
regular basis my wife kept putting hers off both myself and her 
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done  Her gynocologist even 
scheduled one but she didnt show uptoo busy running the Operating Room for 
the biggest Hospital in Tulsa

One more thing I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist  This group uses 
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease  There is 
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have 
drug actions in the body  But you talk about flying blind man this is 
really blind treatment  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and 
minerals are being used  Im not saying that some of this stuff couldnt 
be right on the money it may well be  But my approach to nutrition is a 
lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan the two MDs who wrote the new 
Clinical Nutrition textbook  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab 
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet 
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you 
handle stress  Thats where Im coming from folks  Blast away if you want
Im not going to change  Put me in your killfile if you want I really 
dont care  Im averaging 810 email messages a day from people who think 
that Ive got something important to say  But Im also getting hit by a 
few with an axe to grind  Thats life

Chromium is one of the trace elements  It has a very limitedbut very 
important role in the body  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor
GTF  GTF is made up of chromium nicinamideniacin glycine cysteine 
and glutamic  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to 
form GTF  Some foods already have GTFLiver brewers or nutritional yeast
and black pepper  When chromium is in GTF a pretty good absorption is 
seenabout 20  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral 
chelatechromium picolinate its absorption is much lower1 to 2 lowest 
for all the minerals  Ive been posting in Misc Fitness and chromium has 
come up there several times as a fat burner  Chromium is among the least 
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really 
do any harm  I wouldnt do it though  The adequate and safe range for 
chromium is 50 to 200ug per day  The average American is getting about 
30ug per day from hisher diet  Chromium levels decrease with age and many 
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency  I 
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in 
Type II diabetes but Im not going to because for each positive one there 
also seems to be a negative one as well  Im convinced that the problem is 
bioavailability  When yeastGTF is used good results are obtained but when 
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative  In addition to 
Type II diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and 
glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is 
concerned

Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease 
this possible link with chromium isnt too surprising  Glucoma is a little 
more interesting  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin 
responsive glucosedriven metabolic function  If this eye focusing activity 
is impairedby a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular 
pressure is believed to be elevated  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with 
glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium J Am Coll 
Nutr 1055361991  But this one preliminary study should not prompt 
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements  For one thing 
just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless 
they have been taking chromium suppleemntsyeast  Since glucoma is often 
found in older people its not too surprising that chromium was low in the 
RBCs  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would 
prompt some attention  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to 
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma

You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC 
chromium test or hair analysis  Most clinical labs are not going to run a 
RBC chromium  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail 
analysis for you but I wouldnt use them  There is just too much funny 
business going on in these unregulated labs right now

Heres Weinsier and Morgan advise on chromium  They do not consider 
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is 
availablethey dont like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they 
also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not 
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs  This has to change 
and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum it will  What then do they suggest
Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical 
response to chromiumrun a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium 
supplementation  Once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug of 
CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day

Whats my advise  Dont take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
they just do not work that way  If you want to take them and then 
exercise that would be great  Do include yeast as part of your dietmost 
Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet  If you do have 
a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status  
When he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say 
please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgans new Clinical Nutrition textbook 
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose 
tolerance  If you cant do that Ill find a doctor who can thank you 
very much
