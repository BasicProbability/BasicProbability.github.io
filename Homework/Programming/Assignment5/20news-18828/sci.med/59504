Subject Re Candidayeast Bloom Fact or Fiction


In a previous article banschbachvmsocomokstateedu  says
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the US  Its really 
too bad that most US medical schools dont cover nutrition because if 
they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the 
medical profession

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply ie B12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy B12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet I sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients
systemic candida infection  I think The Yeast Connection is
a bunch of hooey  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught anyway

Here is a brief primer on yeast  Yeast infections as they are commonly 
called are not truely caused by yeasts  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeastlike fungus  

Well maybe Im getting picky but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the
mold form  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds 
depending on environment  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism  it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection  a fungus infection  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a moldlike fungus

Youre the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didnt know 
that a yeast is a form of a fungus  shudder
Or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying
