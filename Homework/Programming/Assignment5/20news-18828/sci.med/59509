Subject Re Placebo effects

 To turpincsutexasedu Russell Turpin

 RT o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
 RT receive a placebo or the test treatment

It seems to me that many drugs have such severe side effects that 
it might not be possible to keep the doctors from knowing who is 
getting the true drug  This is especially true of the drugs used 
for mental illnesses
