 In a previous article banschbachvmsocomokstateedu  says
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the US  Its really 
too bad that most US medical schools dont cover nutrition because if 
they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the 
medical profession
 
 Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
 well as covering it in other sections as they apply ie B12
 deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy B12 deficiency in
 hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet I sill
 hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine  candida can cause
 mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients
 with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients
 systemic candida infection  I think The Yeast Connection is
 a bunch of hooey  What does this have to do with how well
 nutrition is taught anyway

Elisabeth lets set the record straight for the nth time I have not read 
The Yeast Connection  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing 
by this hated book  Its okay I guess to hate the book by why hate me
Elisabeth Im going to quote from Zinssers Microbiology 20th Edition
A book that you should be familiar with and not hate Candida species 
colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly 
thereafter  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present  
Indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic 
mycosis  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic 
infectioncandidiasis so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or 
sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection  Poor diet and persistent 
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis
Your assessment of candidiasis in the US is correct and I do not dispute 
it

What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic 
infection  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
GI tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity  Knocking down the bacterial 
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida 
blooms  Let me quote from Zinssers again However some factors such as 
the use of a broadspectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to 
both mucosal and systemic infections  I was addressing mucosal infections
I like the term blooms better  The nutrition course that I teach covers 
this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure  I guess that 
your nutrition course does not too bad  


Here is a brief primer on yeast  Yeast infections as they are commonly 
called are not truely caused by yeasts  The most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a 
yeastlike fungus  
 
 Well maybe Im getting picky but I always thought that a yeast
 was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the
 mold form  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds 
 depending on environment  Candida exibits what is known as
 reverse dimorphism  it exists as a mold in the tissues
 but exists as a yeast in the environment  Should we maybe
 call it a mold infection  a fungus infection  Maybe we
 should say it is caused by a moldlike fungus

 Youre the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didnt know 
 that a yeast is a form of a fungus  shudder
 Or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying

My my Elisabeth do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you  If you 
noticed my faculty rank Im a biochemist not a microbiologist
Candida is classifed as a fungusaccording to Zinssers  But as you point 
out it displays dimorphism  It is capable of producing yeast cells 
pseudohyphae and true hyphae  Elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist 
and that makes a lot of sense to you  To a biochemist its a lot of 
Greek  So I called it a yeastlike fungus go ahead and crucify me

You know Elisabeth I still havent been able to figure out why such a small 
little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in 
Sci Med  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too
I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what 
Ive said that it will make sense  Im not asking anyone here to buy into 
The Yeast Connection book because I dont know whats in that book plain 
and simple And to be honest with you Im beginning to wish that it was never 
written
