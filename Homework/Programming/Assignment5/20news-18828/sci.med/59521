 I recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called sumatripton
 I have no idea of the actual spelling that supposedly utilizes a chemical
 that trips neurotransmitters  My mother has regular migraines and nothing
 seems to help  does anyone know anything about this new drug  Is it in
 a testing phaze or anywhere near approval  Does it seem to be working
 
My girlfriend just started taking this drug for her migranes  It really
helped her get through the rebound withdrawl when she got off analgesics 
She doesnt have a mail account but asked me to forward this

Glaxo is the distributor Imitrex is the drugs brand name  It works 
She can call her pharmacy for more info The miracle drug has been used
for years in Europe and for some time in Canada  Trials in the US were
completed and the drug hit the US market at the end of March  Some
pharmacies dont stock it yet  Presently it needs to be injected
subcutaneously although testing is starting with a nasal spray form  It
mimics serotonin its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors
looks identical to serotonin on a model I saw

Opinions are mine or others but definately not MDAs
