Subject Re Vasectomy Health Effects on Women

In article 1993Apr271104405069niccsunet eskagerbnermalsantarosaedu Eric Skagerberg writes
 Does anyone know of any studies done on the longterm health effects of a
 mans vasectomy on his female partner
 
 Ive seen plenty of study results about vasectomys effects on mens health
 but what about women 
 
 For example might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for
 say cervical cancer  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies  Changes in the
 vaginas pH  Yeast or bacterial infections
 
 Outside of study results how about informed speculation

Ive heard of NO studies but speculation

Why on earth would there be any effect on womens health  Thats about 
the most absurd idea Ive heard since Ted Kaldiss claim that no more than 
35000 people would march on Washington

Ok one point  Greatly reduced chance of pregnancy  But thats it
