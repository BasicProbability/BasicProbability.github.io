Subject Whats a bone scan

My mother has been advised to have a bone scan performed  What is this
procedure for and is it painful  Shes been having leg and back pain
which her GP said was sciatica  Her oncologist listened to her symptoms
and said that it didnt sound like sciatica and she should get a bone
scan
