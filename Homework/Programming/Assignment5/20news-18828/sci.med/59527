Subject Re Candidayeast Bloom Fact or Fiction

In article banschbachvmsocomokstateedu writes

Im not asking anyone here to buy into The Yeast Connection book
because I dont know whats in that book plain and simple And to be honest
with you Im beginning to wish that it was never written

I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way
it was  My doctor  who claims to have introduced Dr Crook to the
possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in
1961 I have no reason to doubt him on this  does not like the book
because 1 it makes too many unfounded claims and 2 is horribly written
from a scientific viewpoint  On the other hand my doctor has always kept
an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the yeast
connection

But I believe there is some truth to the book  Hopefully the right
clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction  In
the meantime Id still encourage people who have incurable chronic sinus
problems especially if they overused antibiotics to find a doctor to
administer a systemictype antifungal such as itraconazole along with
liver panels before during and after treatment just to play it safe  It
is an empirical approach for sure but when all else fails and your ENT
says sorry youll just have to live with it it is time to step out and
try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence
Dr Ivker supported by plausible theories outlined by Marty  At
this stage you have little to lose particularly if you use itraconazole and
have the proper monitoring  the health risk has been shown through extensive
clinical studies both in Europe and the US to be very minimal with
relatively healthy ie nonAIDS patients  Im glad I did this since I
saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox itraconazole  Of
course your mileage may vary a lot  everyone is different so it may not
work for you  Talk to your doctor
