When I was a school boy my biology teacher told us of an incident
in which a couple were very passionate without actually having
sexual intercourse  Somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation
Was my biology teacher misinforming us or do such incidents actually
occur

Sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg  There is only one way for
pregnancy to occur intercourse  These days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques but were speaking of
natural acts here  It is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina ie coitus interruptus but thats
about at far as you can get  Through clothes  no way  Better go talk
to your biology teacher

Well now Doc I sure would not want to bet my life on those little
critters not being able to get thru one layer of sweatsoaked cotton
on their way to do their programmed task  Infrequent yes unlikely
yes but impossible  I learned a long time ago never to say never in
medicine   g                        Len Howard MD FACOG
