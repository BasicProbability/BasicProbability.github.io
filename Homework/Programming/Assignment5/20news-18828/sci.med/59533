Subject Re Antihistamine for sleep aid

Im interested in this from the other angle what antihistamine can I
take at bedtime for relief of allergies with the assurance that its
sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning but
preferably with the antiallergy effect lasting longer

Im thinking mainly of OTC products Which has the least duration of
sedative action Benadryl ChlorTrimeton or what
Note that Im asking about duration not intensity
