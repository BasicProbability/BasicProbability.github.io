First off if Im not mistaken only hibernating animals have brown fat
not humans

	Human infants do have bown fat deposits while adult humans are
believed not to have brown fat
	Also while brown fat may play an important role in rousing
hibernators it is definitely not limited to hibernating animals  it
is a common energy source for nonshivering thermogenesis
