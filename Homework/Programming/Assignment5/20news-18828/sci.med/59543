Subject Cold Sore Location

Ive had cold sores in the past  But they have always been in the 
corner of my mouth  Recently  Ive had what appears to be
a cold sore but on my lower lip in the middle above the chin

Can cold sores appear anywhere around the mouth or body

Is there a medical term for cold sore
