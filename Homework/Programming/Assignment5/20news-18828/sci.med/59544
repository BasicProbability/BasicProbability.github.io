Subject thyroidal deficiency

Hi

My wife has aquired some thyroidal sp deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep coldness and proneness
to gaining weight She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary 
tests and her values were regarded as low The doctor and my wife are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the 
gland giving lifelong dependency to the drug hormone The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp and been given
some drops to reactivate either her thyroidal gland andor the 
messagecenter in the brain sorry about the approximate language
but I havent got many clues to what the english terms are but the 
brainarea is called the hypofyse in norwegian 

My questions are has anyone hadheard of success in using this approach
Her values have been slowly but steadily sinking any comment on the
probability of improvement Although the doctor has told her to eat
normally my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illnesscondition may this
affect the treatment development

I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested and I
will greatly value any informationopinionexperience on this topic

I dont intend this post to be either a flaming of the established
medical profession or a praise for alternatives I am just relaying
events as they have happened

Sincerely

Erik A Wolff
