 I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
 socalled paranormal stuff but as far as Im concerned it is just
 as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
 quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis
 
 Oooooh  Bad example  Im an atheist
 
 This is not flame or abuse nor do I want to start another thread this
 is after all supposed to be about IMAGE PROCESSING

 BUT to say youre an atheist is to suggest you have PROOF there is NO GOD

 That means that there cannot be any atheists  since there is NO WAY that you
can prove that there is no god Atheists are people who BELIEVE that there is no
god most not only believe but also are damn sure that there isnt a god like
me
