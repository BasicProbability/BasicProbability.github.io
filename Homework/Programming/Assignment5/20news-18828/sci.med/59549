Subject Re Antihistamine for sleep aid


In article 1993Apr2905204423918nmtedu houlenmtedu Paul Houle writes

 	Anyway  I am looking for advice for the use of
 antihistamines as sleep aids  and if there are any dangers of such use
 Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
 millions  I dont want to try BZs  because BZ addiction seems to be
 a serious threat  and from what I hear  BZ sleep quality is not good
 whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me  I have
 tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff  and that also seems to
 lower sleep quality  I seem to wake up around 400 or so and be in some
 kind of mental haze until 700 or 800  Also  I would be interested in
 any other advice for helping my problem  Although Ive already tried
 many of the nonpharmacological solutions

Antihistamines have been the active ingredient of OTC sleep aids for
decades  Go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as Sominex Nytol etc  The active ingredient is
diphenhydramine the same antihistamine thats in Benadryl
