Subject Vitamin A and Infection

Ive sent Gordon R my posts on protein vitamin C and vitamin A prior to 
posting on internet as a professional courtesy  Somehow Ive managed to 
delete my vitamin A post from my text file  Gordon R had promised to send 
it back to me but hes pretty mad at me right now so Ill just retype it
Since digging through all my references is very time consumingtook me all 
day for that PMS post Im not going to cite any referencesGordon R has 
them  Im going to include some of the material from Weinsier and 
Morgans new Nutrition textbookwhich was not in my original material to 
point out that what Im going to say has some support in the medical 
community

Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long 
time  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and Ive 
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection
Now Im going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in 
the US as far as infection is concernedvitamin A

When vitamin A was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as 
the antiinfection vitamin  Many peopleLinus Pauling being one have 
decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C
which Ive already covered  Big mistakein my opinion  Vitamin A is 
also getting a reputation as an anticancer vitaminwith good reason
The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if 
vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well  Its role in 
both cancer and infection is almost identicalbut not quite

Vitamin A comes in two completely different formsretinol and 
betacarotene  Retinol is the animal form and its toxic betacarotene 
is the plant form and its completely nontoxic  Both retinol and beta
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
6080  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other 
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding proteinRBP  A normal human 
adult liver should have 500000IU to 1000000IU of retinol stored  We 
are born with 10000IU in our liver  US autopsy has shown that about 
30 of Americans die with the sameor less amount of vitamin A as they 
were born with  If you dont believe that nutritional reserveslike that 
of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin A reserve is 
not going to affect you  But if you believelike I do that the nutrient 
reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin A in the US

The US RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1000 RE or 5000IU of 
vitamin A  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4000IU of vitamin A  Diet 
surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A
either retinol or Betacarotene from their diet  But the NRCNational 
Research Council was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the 
RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raisedC to 90mg per day and A to 
7500IU per day for adult males  That report and its recommendations was 
killed  Why Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main 
reason  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient 
reserves full  Many scientist in the US feel that the time has come to 
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move 
towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have 
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely 
important during periods of stress  The nutritonal concervatives won that 
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 
1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the 
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 
1940sget enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill 
the reserves

We know from autopsy that only about 10 of Americans have a liver with a 
normal vitamin A reserve500000IU to 1000000IU  I preach nutrient 
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients
But for vitamin A only a liver biopsyor autopsy data will tell you how 
much somebody has stored  We can tell very easily if someone has 
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol 
levellevels above 450ugdl are highly suggestive that you have filled your 
liver with vitamin A and its time to stop taking retinol  The normal 
range of serum retinol will be 20100ugdl  Hypervitaminosis A is 
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2000ugdl or higherInterpretation 
of Diagnostic Test Wallach MD a Little Brown Series book  This level 
of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to 
vitamin A toxicity  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative 
approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach as you will see later in 
this post  Between 450ugdl and 2000ugdl you should have plenty 
of warning that its time to eliminate the retinol from your dietheadache 
redness of the skin hair loss joint pain

I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they 
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear 
signs that the liver is full  You will never really know if the patient 
needs the vitamin Abecause you can not measure the pool in liver but you 
will always know when its time to stopjust like in those vitamin A for 
PMS studies

Betacarotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will 
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of betacarotene to 
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow downstops in the 
liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol  But 
taking Betacarotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to 
fill the liver upIve seen estimates of 2030 years if you are in the 30 
that only has as much as you were born with in your liver10000IU  One 
other problem with betacarotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not 
convert as much betacarotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the 
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc  In addition the release of 
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will 
cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A

Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection  The body 
uses vitamin Aretinol for many different things  Visionthe first to be 
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde
retinal and alcoholretinol form of vitamin A  Reproduction uses the 
retinol form  and some retinal  Infection and cancer protection uses 
retinoic acid  How do you convert retinolwhich your white blood cells 
and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid  You use enzymes 
one of which requires vitamin Cthis is why Pauling has tried to pull the 
title of antiinfection vitamin away from vitamin A  Vitamin C does play 
a role in infectioninterferon production for example but its biggest role 
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid  If you increase your intake 
of vitamin C you will increase your formation of retinoic acid  But 
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinolas retinal can and once 
its formed its used and then lost to the body  This is why the 1985 NRC 
group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDAs

Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are 
helping themselves  If they dont have much vitamin A in their liver and 
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A they actually do 
themselves more harm than good

Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation
In the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus 
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from 
entering the blood system  The mucus membrane is referred to as the first 
line defense against infection  For cancer retinoic acid has been shown 
to act as a cell brakeit counteracts the effect of cell promoters which 
stimulate cells to divide  Cancer has two distinct steps DNA alteration 
and cell promotion  For cells that normally divide all the time promoters 
are not that important  But for lung and breast tissue which does not 
normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process
This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials 
in progress using retinol andor betacarotene

Chronic infectionirritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that 
vitamin A may not be adequate  I tell my students that any patient who 
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be 
worked up for vitamin Aalong with the other factors that medicine already 
has on its list of causes for chronic infection  I drive this home in my 
course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa when I teach at the allopathic 
medical school in TulsaOUs branch campus and when I give CME lectures

Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night 
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50000IU of retinol  The 
serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver 
reserves drop below 10000 to 20000IU  Asking a patient if they have 
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screenif cataracts are ruled 
out  In one study done on US SpanishAmericans where serum retinol levels 
were measured 25 of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 
20ugdl

As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of 
the US that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably 
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low 
serum retinol levels

What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A  Here are excerpts
from their book

Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for 
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for 
reproduction embryonic development and bone growth  Proteincalorie 
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and 
metabolism of vitamin A  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid 
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not 
in reproduction or vision  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A 
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum  The normal 
range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ugdl  Lower values are 
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores  Serum levels greater 
than 100ugdl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A  Dark adaptation 
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to 
perform on young children  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to 
vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state  The 
bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal 
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected  A daily intake of more than 
75mgabout 37000IU of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts 
over 20mg100000IU can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation 
erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois
bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue  

They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A 
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults  Their toxic serum retinol 
level is very conservative  I recommend that my students try 25000IU in 
adults that are having problems with chronic infection  They have to rule 
out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc runor if their clinical 
lab cant run it I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest give 
them the zinc along with the vitamin A  At 25000IU per day toxicity 
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the 
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol

Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A
Recall that the PMS papers were using 100000IU to 200000IU of vitamin A
I dont suggest that my students use these high doses  If you wanted to 
fill the liver up fastas part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the 
serum retinol level then you would be okay  But my knowledge of the 
vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25000IU for patients with a 
demonstrated vitamin A deficitdark adapatation test or serum retinol will 
provide a good and steady improvementas long as zinc and vitamin C status 
are good without having to worry about toxicity  If they want to get more 
agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol  But 
vitamin Aretinol should never be given in high dose to women who could 
become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human 
fetus  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 
18000IU of retinol per day  Betacarotene will never have this effect on 
the human fetus

Could just taking Betacarotene instead of retinol supplements help  Yes 
but the effect will take a long time to develop  My advise is to use 
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to betacarotene to keep it 
full  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to 
prescription by doctors  But when we have the MDs in this newsgroup 
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A 
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress I 
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market 
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general 
public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation
