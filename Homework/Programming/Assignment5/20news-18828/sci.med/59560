She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary 
tests and her values were regarded as low The doctor and my wife are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the 
gland giving lifelong dependency to the drug hormone

This is ridiculous and your doctor sounds like a nut if what is
reported here is what the doctor actually said  If your wifes
pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic shell
need insulin replacement  That doesnt mean shes dependent on
insulin anymore than she was beforehandif her body doesnt make
enough shell have to get it elsewhere  Oral thyroid replacement
hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and
its really the only effective therapy available anyway  Plus its
cheap  Taking thyroid hormone when it isnt needed does cause your
thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone but thats a
feature not a bug and its irrelevant in any case in the face of
hypothyroidism because her problem that her gland isnt producing
enough  There isnt a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency
caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone
analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of
prolonged administration of corticosteroids so there should be no
worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland

The last couple of 
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp and been given
some drops to reactivate either her thyroidal gland andor the 
messagecenter in the brain sorry about the approximate language
but I havent got many clues to what the english terms are but the 
brainarea is called the hypofyse in norwegian 

Homeopathy is nonsense  Tell her to stop wasting her money health and time
and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make
a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy
