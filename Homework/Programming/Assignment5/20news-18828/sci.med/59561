One question I do have  a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water  said he told swimmers to do this after swimming too  It
works but it stings like the devil so Ive always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times wont do the trick  Any
comments

Perhaps diluting the rubbing alcohol in some water until you
feels comfortable will do the trick
