Subject Lithium questions Doctor wants my 10 year old on it


Hi scimed folks

I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium

I have a 10 year old son that lives with my exwife  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin Tofranil and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion  I would like to 
know whatever is important that I should know  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like proscons regarding Lithium therapy

I have a booklet from the Lithium Information Center based at the 
University of Wisconsin but feel that it is prolithium and would be
interested in comments from the not necessarily PRO side of the fence

I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed

Thanks for any information you can provide

Please email me directly
