Subject Legality of placebos



How is it that placebos are legal  It would seem to me that if as a patient
you purchase a drug youve been prescribed and its just sugar or whatever
theres a few legal complications that arise

	1 
If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you arent given accepted
treatment for it it seems like intentional medical malpractice

	2
A placebo should fall legally under the label of quackery why not

	3
Getting what you pay for  Deceptive bait and switch to an extreme  False
advertising  what if McDonalds didnt put 100 pure beef in their hamburgers


	So Im mystified  Are these assumptions erred  If they arent why the
hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo

Thanks
