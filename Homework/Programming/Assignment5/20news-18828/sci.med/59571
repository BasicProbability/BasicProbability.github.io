Subject Re Legality of placebos

How is it that placebos are legal  It would seem to me that if as a patient
you purchase a drug youve been prescribed and its just sugar or whatever
theres a few legal complications that arise

	1 
If you have been diagnosed with a condition and you arent given accepted
treatment for it it seems like intentional medical malpractice

A placebo is an accepted treatment at times 

	2
A placebo should fall legally under the label of quackery why not

Why should it  Placebos are effective under certain circumstances  Thats
why theyre used  

Actually I dont know know anyone who has actually gotten a sugar pill
I dont know how it could be done since prescription drugs are always
labeled and its easy enough to find out whats in a pill if you have the
name

Its more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something just
not for what you have  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most
common such placebo 

	3
Getting what you pay for  Deceptive bait and switch to an extreme  False
advertising  what if McDonalds didnt put 100 pure beef in their hamburgers

Im not sure what you mean by this  What do you think youre paying for
Youre not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a
doctors appointment
