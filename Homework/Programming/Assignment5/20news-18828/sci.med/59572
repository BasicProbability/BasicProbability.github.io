 i heard a news report indicating research showing improved         
 hearing in people taking vitamin A the research showed that new    
 growth replaced damaged hairlike nerves has anyone heard about
 this 
 
Claude Ive not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A
retinol could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damageusually caused by 
high sound levels but also occassionally due to severe infection  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process  The hair cell nervelike epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiationembryogenesis but I dont 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss  But with only a news announcement to go 
onand this type of communication is notoriously bad I cant comment on 
your question anymore than I already have  If one study has been done 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one
