 BUT to say youre an atheist is to suggest you have PROOF there is NO GOD
 To be a politicallycorrect skeptic better to go with agnostic like me 


As a selfproclaimed atheist my position is that I believe that there is
no god  I dont claim to have any proof  I interpret the agnostic position 
as having no beliefs about gods existence
