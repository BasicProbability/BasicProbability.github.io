Subject Re Deadly NyQuil

 My friend insists that NyQuil can be deadly if enough is taken  he
 suggested something like 2030 of the Nighttime gelcaps would do someone
 in  Being a NORMAL user of NyQuil  I checked the ingredients and
 have a very hard time believing it  They are
 
 250 g acetaminophen
        
 30 mg Pseudoephedrine HCl
 10 mg Dextromethorphan HBr
 625 mg Doxylamine Succinate
 per softgel
 
 Can someone settle our bet a package of NyQuil of course   what 
 effect would 2030 of these babies have

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
OTC medication  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater
can cause hepatotoxicity and doses of 25 grams or more are
potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis  If I recall
correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves Nhydroxylation to Nacetylbenzoquinoneimine which
is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione  When hepatic
glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay 24 days between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage  This is NOT a nice way to die

As to taking 2030 of these tablets that comes to 575 grams
of acetaminophen  In a normal adult this would probably
cause nausea vomiting abdominal pain and loss of appetite
