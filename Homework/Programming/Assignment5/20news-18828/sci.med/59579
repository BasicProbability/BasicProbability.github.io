Actually I dont know know anyone who has actually gotten a sugar pill


Its more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something just
not for what you have  Antibiotics for viral infections are the most
common such placebo 

And presumably this is a matter of degree it must be common to prescribe
a drug that has some chance of giving some benefit but not a high
probability of it andor not a large benefit  Right
