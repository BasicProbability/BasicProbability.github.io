   A good source of information on Burzynskis method is in The Cancer Industry
   by pulitzerprize nominee Ralph Moss

Interesting What book got Moss the pulitzer nomination None of the
flyers for his books mention this and none of the Cancer Chronicle
Newsletters that I have mention this either

   Also a nonprofit organization called People Against Cancer
   which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to
   access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the
   cancer industry but which have shown highly promising results all
   of which are nontoxic

Moss is People Against Cancers Director of Communications People
Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information not
exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to Most
maybe all of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern
treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer and
many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well
