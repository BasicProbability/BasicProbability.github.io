   Any opinions on Burzynskis antineoplastons or information about the current 
   status of his research would be appreciated

Burzynskis work is not too promising None of his A1 through A5
antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against
experimental cancer The NCI conducted tests of A2 and A5 against
leukemia in mice with the result that doses high enough to produce
toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth
of the tumor or killing it These were in 1983 and 1985

Burzynski claims that A10 is the active factor common to all of A1
and A5 something which he has not shown A10 has only been
extracted from A2 He also hasnt shown that A1 through A5 are actually
distinct substances The NCI conducted a series of tests using A10
against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines
from tumors in the following classes leukemia nonsmallcell and
smallcell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous
system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal cancer A10 exhibited
neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested

It is necessary to process A10 since it is not soluble Burzynskis
theory requires soluble agents but this basically hydrolizes it to
PAG which he calls AS 25 PAG is not an information carrying
peptide something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for
antineoplastic activity AS 21 also derived from A10 is a 41
mixture of PA and PAG PA also not a peptide can be purchased at a
chemical supply houses for about 009 a gram A10 is chemically
extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which are
habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy The nasty effects
of thalidomide are widely known In spite of this similarity A10
does not appear to have been tested for its potential to induce
teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy

Many of Burzynskis statements about the origin of his theory early
research past and present support by others for his work have been
shown to be untrue
