Can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease
and a chronic one For example persistent hepatitis vs chronic
hepatitis

I dont think there is a general distinction  Rather there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis  I cant think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic

Much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent
sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well

I beg to differ  Chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active and generally leads to liver failure  At the very
minimum the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes what some
call transaminitis  Chronic persistant hepatitis simply means that
the patient has HbSag in hisher blood and can transmit the infection but
shows no evidence of progressive disease  If I had to choose Id much
rather have the persistant type
