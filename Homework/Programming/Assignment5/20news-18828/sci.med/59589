 I am neither a real believer nor a disbeliever when it comes to
 socalled paranormal stuff but as far as Im concerned it is just
 as likely as the existence of for instance a god which seems to be
 quite accepted in our societies  without any scientific basis

    But no one or at least not many people are trying to pass off God
as a scientific fact  Not so with Kirlian photography  Ill admit that
it is possible that some superior intelligence exists elsewhere and if
people want to label that intelligence God Im not going to stop
them  Anyway lets not turn this into a theological debate  

 I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
 something ANYTHING simply because it doesnt fit your current frame
 of reference History shows that many great people great scientists
 were people who kept an open mind  and were ridiculed by sceptics

    Read altfanrobertmcelwaine sometime  Ive never been so
closedminded before subscribing to that group
