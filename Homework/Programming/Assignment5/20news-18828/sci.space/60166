 According the IAU Circular 5744 Comet ShoemakerLevy 1993e may be
 temporarily in orbit around Jupiter  The comet had apparently made a
 close flyby of Jupiter sometime in 1992 resulting in the breakup of the
 comet  Attempts to determine the comets orbit has been complicated by
 the near impossibility of measuring the comets center of mass


Am I missing something  what does knowing the comets center
of mass do for you in orbit determination

Shag

Im not sure but it almost sounds like they cant figure out where the 
nucleus is within the coma If theyre off by a couple hundred
miles well you can imagine the rest


Phil Fraering         Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff
