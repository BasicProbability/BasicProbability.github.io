Question is can someone give me 10 examples of direct NASASpace related
research that helped humanity in general It will be interesting to see

Pat TANG  Mylar I think  I think they also pushed Hi Tech
Pat Composites for airframes  Look at Fly by Wire

Swept wingsif you fly in airliners youve reaped the benefits

Didnt one of the early jet fighters have these
I also think the germans did some work on these in WWII

Winglets  Area ruling  Digital fly by wire  Ride smoothing

A lot of this was also done by the military

Microwave landing systems  Supercritical wings  General aviation
air foils

Werent the first microwave landing systems from WWII too

shaferrigeldfrfnasagov                    Of course I dont speak for NASA
 A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all  Unknown US fighter pilot
