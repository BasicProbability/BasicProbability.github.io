Any comments on the absorbtion of the Office of Exploration into the
Office of Space Sciences and the reassignment of Griffin to the Chief
Engineer position  Is this just a meaningless administrative
shuffle or does this bode ill for SEI

In my opinion this seems like a Bad Thing at least on the surface
Griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting
things done and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to
getting things done faster better and cheaper  Its unclear to me
whether he will be able to do this at his new position

Does anyone know what his new duties will be

First Ive heard of it Offhand

Griffin is no longer an office head so thats bad

On the other hand

Regress seemed to think we cant fund anything by Griffin because
that would mean and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
 400 billion mars mission to prove it that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost 400 billion Therefore there will be
no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera

They were killing Griffins main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because hes
a communist hardliner

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward
wont be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
ghetto That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
good And if he brings something up noone can say why dont you go
back to the OSE where you belong and where he couldnt even get money
for design studies

Phil Fraering         Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff
