This bit interests me  How much automatic control is there  Is it
purely autonomous or is there some degree of ground control
 
 The stickandrudder man is always the onboard computer  The computer
 normally gets its orders from a stored program but they can be overridden
 from the ground
 
How is
the transition from aerodynamic flight if thats what it is to hover
accomplished  This is the really new part
 
 Its also one of the tricky parts  There are four different ideas and
 DCX will probably end up trying all of them  This is from talking to
 Mitch Burnside Clapp whos one of the DCX test pilots at Making Orbit
 
 1 Pop a drogue chute from the nose light the engines once the thing
 	stabilizes basefirst  Simple and reliable  Heavy shock loads
 	on an area of structure that doesnt otherwise carry major loads
 	Needs a door in the hot part of the structure a door whose
 	operation is missioncritical
 
 2 Switch off pitch stability  the DC is aerodynamically unstable at
 	subsonic speeds  wait for it to flip and catch it at 180
 	degrees then light engines  A bit scary
 
 3 Light the engines and use thrust vectoring to push the tail around
 	Probably the preferred method in the long run  Tricky because
 	of the fuelfeed plumbing  the fuel will start off in the tops
 	of the tanks then slop down to the bottoms during the flip
 	Keeping the engines properly fed will be complicated
 
 4 Build up speed in a dive then pull up hard losing a lot of speed
 	this things LD is not that great until its headed up and
 	the vertical velocity drops to zero at which point it starts
 	to fall tailfirst  Light engines  Also a bit scary and you
 	probably dont have enough altitude left to try again

Since the DCX is to take off horizontal why not land that way
Why do the Martian Landing thing  Or am I missing something Dont know to
much about DCX and such overly obvious

Why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts Parachute in then


Michael Adams nsmcaacad3alaskaedu  Im not high just jacked

Please enlighten me Ignorance is easy to correct make a mistake and
everyone will let you know you messed up
