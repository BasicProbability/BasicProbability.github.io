Just a bit off Phil  We dont reprocess nuclear fuel because what
you get from the reprocessing plant is bombgrade plutonium  It is
also cheaper given current prices of things to simply fabricate new
fuel rods rather than reprocess the old ones creating potentially
dangerous materials from a national security point of view and then
fabricate that back into fuel rods

Fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go
kind of boom but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium  If you want bomb
grade plutonium use a research reactor not a power reactor  But if you want
a bomb dont use plutonium use uranium
