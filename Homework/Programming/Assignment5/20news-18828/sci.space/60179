Subject Re Griffin  Office of Exploration RIP

Any comments on the absorbtion of the Office of Exploration into the
Office of Space Sciences and the reassignment of Griffin to the Chief
Engineer position  Is this just a meaningless administrative
shuffle or does this bode ill for SEI

Unfortunately things have been boding ill is that a legitimate conjugation
for a while  While the Office of Exploration had some great ideas they never
got much money  Ive heard good things about Griffin but its hard to want
him back in a job where he couldnt do anything

Does anyone know what his new duties will be

The group examining the Freedombased space station redesign proposals is 
headed by Michael Griffin NASAs cheif engineer in the words of Space News
I believe this is him
