Excellent discussion of DCX landing techniques by Henry deleted

Since the DCX is to take off horizontal why not land that way

The DCX will not take of horizontally  It takes of vertically 

Why do the Martian Landing thing 

For several reasons  Vertical landings dont require miles of runway and limit
noise pollution  They dont require wheels or wings  Just turn on the engines
and touch down  Of course as Henry pointed out vetical landings arent quite
that simple

Or am I missing something Dont know to
much about DCX and such overly obvious

Well to be blunt yes  But at least youre learning

Why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts Parachute in then

The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground  Parachutes are however not especially
practical if you want to reuse something without much effort  The landings
are also not very comfortable  However in the words of Georgy Grechko
I prefer to have bruises not to sink
