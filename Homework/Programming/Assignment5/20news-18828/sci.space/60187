Subject SSF Redesign Constellation

SSF is up for redesign again  Lets do it right this
time  Lets step back and consider the functionality we want

1 microgravityvacuum process research
2 life sciences research adaptation to space
3 spacecraft maintenence 

The old NASA approach explified by Shuttle and SSF so far was to
centralize functionality  These projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users 
took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to 
tie their payloads to it and SSF has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication  Over 50 billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization  Meanwhile military and commercial 
users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the 
constellation  

Firstly different functions are broken down into different 
constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function
thus we have the GPSNavstar constellation in 12hour orbits
comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits etc  Secondly the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation
providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed

SSFs 3 main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization

1 We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now
COMET and Mir for longduration flights ShuttleSpacelab for
shortduration flights  The best strategy for this area is
inexpensive incremental improvement installation of US facilities 
on Mir ShuttleMir linkup and transition from ShuttleSpacelab
to a much less expensive SSTOSpacehabCOMET or SSTOSIFCOMET
We might also expand the research program to take advantage of 
interesting space environments eg the highradiation Van Allen belt 
or gasplasma gradients in comet tails  The COMET system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a 
station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO

2 We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity
but also in lunar and Martian gravities and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of LEO  This is a very longterm lowpriority project since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude  Furthermore using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation
and the sample size  So I propose LabRatSat a constellation
tetherbolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in superVanAllenBelt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on EarthMoon EarthMars
Earthasteroid etc trips  The miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated realtime from earth thru a VR
interface  AFter several orbital missions have been flown
followons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface
testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions
are spent on astronauts

3 By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in 
Clarke orbit  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills  Once in place robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs
inject fuel etc  Once the fleet is working it can be
spun off to commercial companys who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards

By applying the successful constellation strategy and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost  For a fraction of SSFs pricetag
we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study
lifes adaptation to a much large  more representative variety 
of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and if needed in specialpurpose
orbits

NB we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality  
Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously 
we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used
to fuel planetwide roverballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return  The descendants of LabRatSats technology can
be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closedecology
greenhouses on Mars at low cost
