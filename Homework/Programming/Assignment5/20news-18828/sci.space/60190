Titan III is the cheapest US launcher on a lb basis

In that case its rather ironic that they are doing so poorly on the commercial
market  Is there a single Titan III on order

They have a few problems The biggest technical problem is the need to find
two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch

They also dont show much interest in commercial launches There is more
money to be made churning out Titan IVs for the government After all
it isnt every day you find a sucker er customer who thinks paying
three times the commercial rate for launch services is a good idea
