Why cant the government just be a tennant

I think this would be a great way to build it but unfortunately
current spending rules dont permit it to be workable 

Actually that is no longer true In the last few years Congress has
ammended laws to provide whatever is needed Note that both Spacehab
and Comet are funded this way

The problems arent legal nor technical The problem is NASAs culture
