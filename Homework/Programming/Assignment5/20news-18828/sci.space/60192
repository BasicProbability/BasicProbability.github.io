 Has anyone ever heard of a food product called Space Food Sticks 

I remember those awful things  They were dry and crumbly and I
recall asking my thirdgrade teacher Miss GFrancisco how they
kept the crumbs from floating around in zeroG  She had no clue
I have not seen anything like them in todays space program

Some Apollo technology is best forgotten
