  SI neatly separates the concepts of mass force and weight
  which have gotten horribly tangled up in the US system
 
   This is not a problem with English units  A pound is defined to
 be a unit of force period  There is a perfectly good unit called
 the slug which is the mass of an object weighing 322 lbs at sea level
 g  322 ftsec2 of course
 

American Military English units perhaps  Us real English types were once 
taught that a pound is mass and a poundal is force being that force that
causes 1 pound to accelerate at 1 fts2  We had a rare olde tyme doing 
our exams in those units and metric as well

American perhaps but nothing military about it  I learned mostly
slugs when we talked English units in high school physics and while
the teacher was an exNavy fighter jock the book certainly wasnt
produced by the military

Poundals were just too flinking small and made the math come out
funny sort of the same reason proponents of SI give for using that
