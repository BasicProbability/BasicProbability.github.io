According the IAU Circular 5744 Comet ShoemakerLevy 1993e may be
temporarily in orbit around Jupiter  The comet had apparently made a
close flyby of Jupiter sometime in 1992 resulting in the breakup of the
comet
 
Ooooh  who would have thought that Galileo would get the chance to
check out a comet TOO

Comet Gehrels 3 which was discovered in 1977 was determined to have
been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973  Comet ShoemakerLevy 1993e
may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to
make some closeup observations  The orbital trajectory for Comet
ShoemakerLevy is still being determined
