 I had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
 first and second grade 6970 7071  They came in Chocolate
 strawberry and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
 and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil well it seemed
 like space foil at the time  

Wasnt there a plain flavor too  They looked more like some
kind of extruded industrial product than food  perfectly
smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends  Kinda scary

 The taste is hard to describe although I remember it fondly  It was
 most certainly more candy than say a modern Power Bar  Sort of
 a toffee injected with vitamins  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough
 approximation of the taste  Strawberry sucked

An other post described it as like a microwaved Tootsie Roll 
which captures the texture pretty well  As for taste they were
like candy only not very sweet  does that make sense I recall
liking them for their texture not taste I guess I have well
developed texture buds

 Man these were my 60s

It was obligatory to eat a few while watching Captain Scarlet
Does anybody else remember that as long as were off the
topic of space
