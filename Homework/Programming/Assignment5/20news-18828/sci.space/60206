Has anyone ever heard of a food product called Space Food Sticks This
was apparently createdmarketed around the time of the lunar expeditions along
with Tang and other dehydrated foods I have spoken with several people
who have eaten these before and they described them as a dehydrated candy 
Any information would be greatly appreciated 

A freeze dried Tootsie Roll tm  The actual taste sensation was like nothing
you will ever willingly experience  The amazing thing was that we ate a second
one and a third and 

I doubt that they actually flew on missions as Im certain they did bad
things to the gastrointestinal tract  Compared to Space Food Sticks Tang was
a gastronomic contribution to mankind
