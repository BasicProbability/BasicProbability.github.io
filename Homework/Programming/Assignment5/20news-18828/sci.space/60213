Excerpts
     Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months 
March 30 confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead 
     The ItarTASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from 
Plesetsk Cosmodrome but provided little description of the payloads mission 
     However based on the satellites trajectory Western observers 
identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic 
emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement 
     Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England said  Western 
observers had concluded that no more would be launched But days after the 
last such satellite reentered the Earths atmosphere Cosmos 2238 was 
launched
