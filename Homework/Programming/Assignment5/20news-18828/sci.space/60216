examples of direct NASASpace related research that helped humanity
in general It will be interesting to see

Pat TANG  Mylar I think  I think they also pushed Hi Tech Pat
Composites for airframes  Look at Fly by Wire

Swept wingsif you fly in airliners youve reaped the benefits

Phil Didnt one of the early jet fighters have these  I also think
Phil the germans did some work on these in WWII

The NACA came up with them before World War II  NASA is directly
descended from the NACA with space added in

Youll notice that I didnt mention sweep wings even though the
X5 tested at whats now Dryden had them  We did steal that one
dirctly from the Germans  The difference is that swept wings dont
change their angle of sweep sweep wings do  Perhaps the similarity
of names has caused some confusion  747s have swept wings F111s
have sweep wings

Winglets  Area ruling  Digital fly by wire  Ride smoothing

Phil A lot of this was also done by the military

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams
demonstrated them  Richard Whitcomb and RT Jones at Langley
Research Center were giants in the field

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling in the 70s and 50s respectively  Its true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds KC135 and YF102 but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement  The YF102 was completely ours and the KC135 was
bailed to us  The Air Force of course was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts

Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s No
mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were
General Dynamics decided to make the F16 flybywire when they saw how
successful we were  Mind you the Avro Arrow and the X15 were both
flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog

Phil Egad Im disagreeing with Mary Shafer  

The NASA habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  On the other
hand all those secondhand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wingssomething most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
cant do
