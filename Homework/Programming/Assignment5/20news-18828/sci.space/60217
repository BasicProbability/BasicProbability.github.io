 The taste is hard to describe although I remember it fondly  It was
 most certainly more candy than say a modern Power Bar  Sort of
 a toffee injected with vitamins  The chocolate Power Bar is a rough
 approximation of the taste  Strawberry sucked
 

Peanut butter was definitely my favorite I dont think I ever took a second bite
of the strawberry

I recently joined NutriSystem and their Chewy Fudge Bar is very reminicent of
the chocolate Space Food This is the only thing I can find that even comes close
the taste It takes you back your tastebuds are happy and your
intestines are in knots joy
