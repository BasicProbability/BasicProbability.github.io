Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s No
mechnaical or analog backup to show you how confident we were

Confident or merely crazed  That desert sun 


successful we were  Mind you the Avro Arrow and the X15 were both
flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog


Gee I thought the X15 was Cable controlled  Didnt one of them have a
total electrical failure in flight  Was there machanical backup systems


The NASA habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  On the other
hand all those secondhand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wingssomething most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
cant do


What do you mean  Overstress the wings  and they fail at teh joints

Youll have to enlighten us in the hinterlands
