I think this would be a great way to build it but unfortunately
current spending rules dont permit it to be workable  For this to
work it would be necessary for the government to guarantee a certain
minimum amount of business in order to sufficiently reduce the risk
enough to make this attractive to a private firm  Since they
generally cant allocate money except one year at a time the
government cant provide such a tenant guarantee

	Try reading a bit  THe government does lots of multi year
contracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses  They just like to be
damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
contract   THe reason they arent cutting defense spending as much
as they would like is the Reagan administration signed enough
Multi year contracts  that its now cheaper to just finish them out

I dont have to try reading a bit Pat  I work as a government
contractor and know what the rules are like  Yes they sign some
damned few  which is why everyone is always having to go to
Washington to see about next weeks funding multiyear contracts
they also arent willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties
when they do decide to cut the multiyear contract and not pay on it
which can happen arbitrarily at any time no matter what previous
plans were to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a
private space station with the government as the expected prime
occupant

Id like a source for that statement about the reason they arent
cutting defense spending as much as they would like I just dont buy
it The other thing I find a bit funny about your posting Pat is
that several other people answered the question pretty much the same
way I did mine is the one you comment and incorrectly I think on
I think that says a lot  You and Tommy should move in together
