Comet Gehrels 3 which was discovered in 1977 was determined to have
been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973  Comet ShoemakerLevy 1993e
may remain in orbit around Jupiter long enough to allow Galileo to
make some closeup observations  The orbital trajectory for Comet
ShoemakerLevy is still being determined
a
 
What about positional uncertainties in SL 1993e   

If Comet ShoemakerLevy 1993e is in Jovian orbit and if the comet
is still hanging around when Galileo arrives then Im sure it will
be added to the list of targets  Well have by then over two years
of Earthbased observations to help narrow down the positions of the
pieces of the comet It probably wont be too much different than
what was done with Gaspra

But when they were
imaging toutatis

Galileo did not image Toutatis  That came from Earthbased radar
