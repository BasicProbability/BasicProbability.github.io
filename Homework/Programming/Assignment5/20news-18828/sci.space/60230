successful we were  Mind you the Avro Arrow and the X15 were both
flybywire aircraft much earlier but analog


Pat Gee I thought the X15 was Cable controlled  Didnt one of them
Pat have a total electrical failure in flight  Was there machanical
Pat backup systems

All reactioncontrolled aircraft are flybywire at least the RCS part
is  On the X15 the aerodynamic control surfaces elevator rudder etc
were conventionally controlled pushrods and cables but the RCS jets
were flybywire

The NASA habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  On the other
hand all those secondhand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wingssomething most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
cant do  

Pat What do you mean  Overstress the wings and they fail at teh
Pat joints

Navy aircraft have folding or sweeping wings in order to save space
on the hangar deck  The F14 wings sweep all the rest fold the
wingtips up at a joint

Air Force planes dont have folding wings since the Air Force has
lots of room
