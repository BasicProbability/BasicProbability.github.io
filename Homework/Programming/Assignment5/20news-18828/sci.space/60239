It isnt feasible for Japan to try to stockpile the amount of oil they
would need to run their industries if they did no use nuclear power

Of course  Given they export 50  of the GNP  What do they do

Well they dont export anywhere near 50 of their GNP Mexicos perhaps
but not their own They actually export around the 910 mark Similar
to most developed countries actually Australia exports a larger share
of GNP as does the United States 14 I think off hand Always likely to
be out by a factor of 12 or more though This would be immediately obvious
if you thought about it

Anything serious enough to disrupt the sea lanes for oil will
also hose their export routes

It is their import routes that count They can do without exports but
they couldnt live without imports for any longer than six months if that

Given they import everything  oil is just one more critical commodity

Too true But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry
