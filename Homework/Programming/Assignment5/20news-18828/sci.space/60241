Subject NASA Wraps

In the April edition of One Small Step for a Space Activist
Allen Sherzer  Tim Kyger write
  Another problem is what are called wraps or sometimes
   the center tax When work for a large program like
   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center the
   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts
   to a slush fund This money is used to fund work the
   center manager wants to fund This sum is estimated to
   be over a third of the funds allocated Think about
   that Of the 30 billion cost of Freedom fully 10
   billion wont be spent on anything having anything
   to do with Space Stations Now maybe that 10 billion
   was wisely spent and maybe it wasnt but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits not distorting
   the cost of other projects Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps Congress has never heard the
   term center tax They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesnt add up They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else

My dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here A couple
of weeks ago when I first read this in your posting I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters if you wondering why I didnt post a
response immediately I do have a real job Im supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters  digging up old 20 kHz
data  looking into SherzerKyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority Also I spent last weekend
in Kansas City at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference extolling the virtues of SSF
to 15000 science teachers

First off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does
exist If I recall the numbers correctly the total tax
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around 40 Million
This was computed by adding up the WP1 WP2 and WP4
center taxes With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
22 Billion my calculater says the tax percentage is
0422  18

Over the life of the SSF program using your figure of 30
billion for the cost of SSF a tax at a 18 rate comes to
540 million This is alot less than 10 billion but I
will concede its still an appreciable amount of pocket
change

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 13 could
be close to the actual rate The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center kind of like McDonalds at some
states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant but you dont if you get it
takeout For example at WP4 the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract and are NOT
subject to the center tax I dont have the numbers in
front of me but Id guess at least 95 of the WP4 funds
go to Rocketdyne So you could be right about a tax
rate of 13 but its only applied to funds spent at the
center and not to the prime contracts

This leads to the obvious question What is the government
doing with SSF funds that dont go to the prime contractors
ie ok WP4 gets a slice of the 30 billion pie A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne What happens
to the balance of the funds which arent eaten
up by the center tax

At WP4 we call these funds we spend inhouse supporting
development funds as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical
power system architecture Our testbed has a real life
solar array field left over from solar cell research
research a few years back with leadacid car batteries
to simulate the NickelHydrogen batteries on SSF DC
switchgear DCDC converter units and simulated
loads Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana As a side point 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone
38 cells have completed 18552 to 23405 cycles the
onorbit batteries go through 5840 cycles per year

As a final example my home division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations for performing system
analyses like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system availability calculations
using a MonteCarlo simulation setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements

Finally the money raised by the tax does not all
go into a slush fund At Lewis the director
does control a small discretionary fund Each year
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter

Most of the tax however goes to fund the general
services at the Center like the library the 
central computer services division the Contractor 
who removes the snow etc Thus it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesnt go for SSF activities To get
an accurate figure you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library for example
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF which would be hard to
compute by itself  how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
1 year is billable to SSF would you base it on
the personhours SSF employees spend reading AVweek
versus the rest of the center personnel You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library Who knows
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library but
we underpay for snow removal Talk about
a burecratic nightmare

My last point is that I cant believe your claim that
Congress has never heard of the term center tax
Unfortunately all of the NASA testimony before
Congress isnt on a computer so I cant do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong But surely
in some GAO audit somewhere these NASA cost methods
were documented for Congress
