McDonnell Douglas rolls out DCX

        HUNTINGTON BEACH Calif  On a pictureperfect Southern
California day McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DCX rocket ship last
Saturday  The company hopes this singlestage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a singlestagetoorbit SSTO
rocket ship

        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico this week  Flight tests will start in
midJune

        Although there wasnt a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for
SSTO research remains cloudy  The SDI Organization  which paid 60
million for the DCX  cant itself afford to fund full development of a
followon vehicle  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a suborbital DCXA SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies

        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of spacebased sensors and weapns  However recent
changes in SDIs political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO
less of a priority  Today the agency is more interested in using DCX as
a step towards a lowcost reusable sounding rocket

        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies
said Col  Simon Pete Worden SDIOs deputy for technology  But Worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program I didnt make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I
have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics headquarters

        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the programs orbital
objective agency officials hail the DCX as an example of the better
faster cheaper approach to hardware development  The agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of
evolutionary technology developments

        Worden said the DCX illustrates how a build a little test a
little approach can produce results on time and within budget  He said
the program  which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months 
showed how todays engineers could move beyond the miracles of our
parents time

        The key is management Worden said SDIO had a very light hand
on this project  We had only one overworked major Jess Sponable

        Although the next phase may involve more agencies Worden said
lean management and a sense of governmentindustry partnership will be
crucial Its essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially

        SDIOs approach also won praise from two California members of the
House Science Space and Technology Committee This is the direction
were going to have to go said Rep  George Brown the committees
Democratic chairman Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years arent
sustainableNASA hasnt learned it yet  SDIO has

        Rep  Dana Rohrbacher Browns Republican colleague went further
Joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team
Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency

        Rohrbacher whose Orange County district includes McDonnell
Douglas also criticized NASAAir Force work on conventional multistaged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology Lets not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top  Lets build a spaceship

         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIOs sponsorship he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology

        McDonnell Douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its
C17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment On very large ventures
companies put in seed money said Charles Ordahl McDonnell Douglas
senior vice president for space systems You need strong government
investments

        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the DCXA they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development  Citing corporate history they liken the process to Douglas
Aircrafts DC aircraft  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the DC3 transport a gradual evolution in singlestage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper DC1

        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will expand the envelope
of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude  The
first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering verticle
takeoff and landing  The second series will send the unmanned DCX up to
5000 feet  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20000
feet

        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase  The final
tests will include a pitchover manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottomdown configuration for a soft fourlegged landing

        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles Pete
Conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing
Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president Conrad paised the vehicles
aircraftlike approach to operations  Features include automated
checkout and access panels for easy maintainance

        If the program moves to the next stage engine technology will
become a key consideration  This engine would have more thrust than the
Pratt  Whitney RL10A5 engines used on the DCX  Each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14760 pounds of
thrust

        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages the A5 model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and threetoon
throttling capability  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround

        Worden said future singlestage rockets could employ
tripropellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union
The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes

        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place  Pratt has
a technology agreement with NPO Energomash the design bureau responsible
for the tripropellant and Energia cryogenic engines
