The NASA habit of acquiring secondhand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing  On the other
hand all those secondhand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wingssomething most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
cant do


What do you mean  Overstress the wings  and they fail at teh joints

Youll have to enlighten us in the hinterlands

No they fold on the dotted line  Look at pictures of carriers with loads of
ac on the deck wings all neatly folded
