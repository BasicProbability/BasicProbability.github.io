 THe SR71 stopped being a real secret by the mid 70s
 I had a friend in high school who had a poster with its picture
 
 It was known well before that  I built a model of it sometime in the
 mid 60s billed as YF12ASR71  The model was based on YF12A specs
 and had a big radar in the nose and 8 AAMs in closed bays on the
 underside of the fuselage  The description even then read speeds
 in excess of Mach 3 at altitudes exceeding 80000 feet
 
 LBJ publically announced the existance of the Blackbird program
 in 1964


Hes also the one who dubbed it the SR71  it was the RS71 until LBJ
mippselled sic it

FWIW
