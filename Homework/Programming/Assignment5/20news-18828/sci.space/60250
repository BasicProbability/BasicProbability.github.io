In scispace you write
 
Try the ENVIRONET database at GSFC FTP to envnetgsfcnasagov or 
12818310416 or call 3102865690  They have data on STS Ariane Titan 
Atlas Delta and Scout launch environments
 
Howdy  Thanks for the info
 
I tried anonymous FTP there but it didnt work
I also tried telnetting to the same address but it asked for a login
and password although there was a note saying that the new username for
environet was envnet  
 
Anyways do you have any idea what else I should try
 
Thanks
Garret
 
 
The home office number for ENVIRONET is 301 2865690 note area
code change  A friend of mine used to use it to get LDEF data but
he had to apply for a login name and password  I have a call in for
more info which I hope to get in the morning
