 Of course the units of force have the same names as those of weight
 but in order to use them you need to keep useful constants like the
 omnipresent 32 ftsec2 around
 
 Maybe youd like to go over again how this system is so natural and
 so easy to use Gary While youre at it you can figure out for us
 the weight of 17 barrels and a quart of foo density 17lb 2 34 oz per
 cubic foot on the moon gravity 5 ft 7 332 insec2 Lets face it
 even the imperial system uses a basically metric way of relating
 quantities ie that would be written as 559 ftsec2 the only
 thing youre hanging on to is the right to express the same quantity
 as 1731 inches 14425 feet 480833 yards or 2186 chains What
 everyone else is saying is why do you want to do that
 
 Any apparent remaining complexity in the SI system is due to the
 multiplicity of the aforesaid prefixes In fact whats going on and
 the fundamental difference between SI and imperial is that you have
 exactly one unit of each type and all values of that type are
 expressed as some multiple of the unit

You mean like seconds minutes hours days months years    

Remember  the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale  Some
revisionists tell the history something like this  The coldest point in a
particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body
temperature of a volunteer turns out he was sick but you cant win em all
Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into
hundredths
								

FWIW
