   McDonnell Douglas rolls out DCX

 


   SSTO research remains cloudy  The SDI Organization  which paid 60
   million for the DCX  cant itself afford to fund full development of a
   followon vehicle  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for

This is a little peculiar way of putting it SDIOs budget this year
was what 34 billion They could fund all of the DC development
out of one years budget  of course they do have other irons in the
fire  and launcher development is not their primary purpose but
the DC development could as easily be paid for by diverting that money
as by diverting the comparable STS ops budget

 oh and before the flames start I applaud the SDIO for funding DCX
devlopment and I hope it works and no launcher development is not
NASAs primary goal either IMHO they are supposed to provide the
enabling technology research for others to do launcher development
and secondarily operate such launchers as they require  but thats
just me
