Please go just one step further
How has the word Clementine been associated with mining


Could be the folk song Clementine  If memory serves part of it goes

   In a cavern by a canyon
   Excavating for a mine
   Dwelt a miner fortyniner
   and his daughter Clementine

Anyone who watched Huckleberry Hound can sing you the chorus  
Is there a storyreal person behind the song
