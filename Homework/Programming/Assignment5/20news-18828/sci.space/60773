Hey What happened to the solar sail race that was supposed to be
for Columbus500

I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
 Sails I understand that the JPL did an extensive study on the subject
 back in the late 70s but I am having trouble gathering such information

Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project
