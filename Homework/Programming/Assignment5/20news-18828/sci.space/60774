     Two GIF images of the ozone maps over the northern and southern
hemispheres are now available at the JPL Info public access site  These maps
were produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite UARS and are courtesy of the Public Information Office
at JPL  Note that the images are in GIF89a format so make sure your display
software supports this format as opposed to the older GIF87a format  The
caption files accompanying the images are appended at the end of this message
as well as being embedded in the images  The images are available by dialup
modem at 1 818 3541333 up to 9600 bps parameters N81 or by using
anonymous ftp to

This graphic depicts chlorine monoxide and ozone over Earths
northern hemisphere in February 1992 and 1993  These maps were
produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper
Atmosphere Research Satellite  The chlorine monoxide ClO maps
left are for a layer about 20 kilometers 66000 feet above
the Earths surface on February 17 1992 above and 1993
below  The ozone maps show the total amount above an altitude
of about 12 kilometers 41000 feet averaged over the period
from February 15 to March 6 for the two years  The Microwave
Limb Sounder developed and operated by a team at NASAs Jet
Propulsion Laboratory is one of several instruments on the
Goddard Space Flight Centers Upper Atmosphere Research
Satellite launched in September 1991

This graphic depicts chlorine monoxide ClO and the Antarctic
ozone hole  These maps produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder
aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite show the amount
of chlorine monoxide left and ozone right in the stratosphere
at altitudes above 20 kilometers 66000 feet  Very small
abundances of ozone appear where there are large abundances of
chlorine monoxide the dominant form of chlorine that destroys
ozone  Data from September 21 1991 top are compared with
those from September 20 1992 bottom  The Microwave Limb
