One could go on and on and on here but I wonder  how
many people read scispace and of what powerinfluence are
these individuals

 	Quick  Everyone who sees this post a reply that says
 
 			Hey I read scispace
 
 Then we can count them and find out how many there are 
 This will also help answer that nagging question Just what is
 the maximum bandwidth of the Internet anyways

A practical suggestion to be sure but one could also peek into
newslists where Brian Reid has posted USENET Readership report for
Mar 93 Another posting called USENET READERSHIP SUMMARY REPORT FOR
MAR 93 gives the methodology and caveats of Reids survey  These
postings failed to appear for a while I wonder why but they are
now back

Reid alas gives us no measure of the powerinfluence of readers
Sorry Mark

I suspect Mark dangling out there on Fidonet may not get newslists
so Ive mailed him copies of these reports

The bottom line

         Estimated total number of people who read the group worldwide
              Actual number of readers in sampled population
                   Propagation how many sites receive this group at all
                         Recent traffic messages per month
                               Recent traffic kilobytes per month
                                     Crossposting percentage
                                         Cost ratio USmonthrdr

The first figure indicates that scispace ranks 88th among mostread
newsgroups

Ive been keeping track sporadically to watch the growth of traffic
and readership  You might be entertained to see this

some kind of glitch in estimating number of readers happens here

Possibly old Usenet hands could give me some more background on how to
interpret these figures glitches or the history of Reids reporting
effort  Take it to email it doesnt belong in scispace
