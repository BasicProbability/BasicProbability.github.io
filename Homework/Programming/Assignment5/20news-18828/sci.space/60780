From ETRATttacs1ttuedu Pack Rat
Subject Shuttle Launch Question

There has been something bothering me while watching
NASA Select for a while  Well I shouldnt say
bothering maybe wondering would be better  When
they are going to launch they say sorry but I forget
exactly who is saying what OTC to PLT I think
Clear caution  warning memory  Verify no unexpected
errors   I am wondering what an expected error might
be  Sorry if this is a really dumb question but
inquiring minds just gotta know

Yeah yeah I know its those dumb cosmospheres again
