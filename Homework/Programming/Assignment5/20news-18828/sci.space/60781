  While youre at it comet experts explain how a comet gets into
  Jovian orbit to begin with
 
  There are nongravitational forces from heating and outgassing when a
  comet gets into the inner solar system  
 
 Dont forget the Galilean satellites of Jupiter  
 
 My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny
 masses sitting very close to Jupiter play any role whatsoever in the
 problem   Or to put it more technically the extra volume they add
 to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible
 
 Jupiter is 2E27 kg while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23
 
 Also as I said the few references that Ive looked at do not
 mention outgassing or breakup as important processes  The important
 thing is a JupiterSuncomet reverse slingshot that leads to a
 weakly Jupiterbound orbit for the comet at least a temporary one
