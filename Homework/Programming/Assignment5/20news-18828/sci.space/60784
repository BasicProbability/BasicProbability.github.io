                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                             POSTLAUNCH
                         April 9  15 1993

SPACECRAFT

1  On April 9 realtime commands were sent as planned to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna LGA2
swingDual Drive Actuator DDA hammer activities

2  On April 9 the EJ1 EarthJupiter 1 sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12 1993 to June 14 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna RRA slew test on April 28 1993  The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load

3  On April 12 and 15 a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase

4  On April 12 cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer
MAG instruments  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly

5  On April 12 an UltraStable Oscillator USO test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data long term trend analysis is continuing

6  On April 14 a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal SignaltoNoise Ratio SNR when transmitting at 40bps  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present prelaunch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level

7  On April 15 cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV and Magnetometer MAG instrument
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly

8  On April 15 a periodic RPM RetroPropulsion Module 10Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal

9  The ACDC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes greater than 25 DN throughout this period  The AC measurement reads
19 DN 43 volts  The DC measurement reads 111 DN 129 volts  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ACDC special
anomaly team

GDS Ground Data Systems

1  Galileo participated in a second DSN Deep Space Network acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13 1993 using CTA21
Compatibility Test Area 21  The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
TGC and the Telemetry Channel Assembly TCA  The TGCTCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly TPA  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test all ran well on both the MTS MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem and the AMMOS MGDS V180 GIF with the exception of 10bps  The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock it appears the TGCTCA was
not metering the data correctly  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted MVT Mission Verification Test of
the TGCTCA system is expected to begin May 16 1993


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday April 15 1993 the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows

	Distance from Earth         152606000 km 102 AU
	Distance from Sun           277519800 km 186 AU
	Heliocentric Speed          93400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543973900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes 4 seconds


SPECIAL TOPIC

1  As of April 15 1993 a total of 70184 realtime commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch  Of these 65076  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the realtime command process
In the past week 7 real time commands were transmitted 6 were initiated in
the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process
Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference
uplink the EJ1 sequence memory load and reset the command loss timer
