Subject Re Russian Operation of US Space Missions

I know people hate it when someone says somethings like there was an article 
about that somewhere a while ago but Im going to say it anyway  I read an
article on this subject almost certainly in Space News and something like
six months ago  If anyone is really interested in the subject I can probably
hunt it down given enough motivation
