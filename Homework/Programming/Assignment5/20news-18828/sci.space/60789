  So how close would the comet have gotten to Jupiter on the pass that
  put it into temporary orbit and how far is it likely to get from
  Jupiter before it makes its escape
 
 The answer to all of these questions is we dont know yet
 We dont know for sure if the comet is in a temporary orbit
 
I see  I wasnt so interested in this particular case as in typical
behavior anyway  Can these questions be answered for a previous
instance such as the Gehrels 3 that was mentioned in an earlier posting
 
 Gehrels 3 was in a temporary Jovian orbit for about 3 or 4 years  Ill
 get the orbital elements from Dance of the Planets and post them here

Sorry folks I should have done this and meant to just after i hit the 
send key

Orbital Elements of Comet 1977VII from Dance files

Also perihelions of Gehrels3 were

April  1973     83 jupiter radii
August 1970     3 jupiter radii

Hope this helpsIm even less of an orbital mechanic than I am an artist
