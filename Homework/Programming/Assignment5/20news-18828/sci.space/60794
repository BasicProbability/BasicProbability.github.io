In the old days  their used to be Arbitron stats  that analyzed
the readership and posting volumes  by group  and user

They were available from UUNET   Thats how you check the
readership of Scispace  not some stupid  unscientific attempt
to  flood the newsgroup

I have abetter idea  WHy dont we all reply directly to the
origanator  of this post  and tell him we read scispace

	I try to make a little joke I try to inject some humour here
and what happens  In the immortal words of Foghorn Leghorn

	I say that was a joke son

	I thought that the bit about McElwaine not to mention the two
smileys would indicate to even the most humour impaired that I was
JOKING
	Sigh
	And will everyone who pats suggestion thanks bunches pat
