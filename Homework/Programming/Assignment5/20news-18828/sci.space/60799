	Quick  Everyone who sees this post a reply that says

			Hey I read scispace

Then we can count them and find out how many there are 
This will also help answer that nagging question Just what is
the maximum bandwidth of the Internet anyways

Dont you think it would be better to Email back to you that we read scispace
so that you can count them and every server in the world does not have to get
BWd to death  Or instead you could possible cut and past all the senders into
a single post and save on header bandwidth  Not meaning to be taken as a 
flame  its late and we have to work toward a demo  little punchy
