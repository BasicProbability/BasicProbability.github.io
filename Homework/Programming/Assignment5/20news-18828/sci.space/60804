Subject Big amateur rockets

I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in
the back  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe
science or questionablely legal but this one really grabbed my attention
It was from a company name Personal Missle Inc or something like that

Anyhow the ad stated that theyd sell rockets that were up to 20 in length
and engines of sizes F to M  They also said that some rockets will
reach 50000 feet

Now aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one
of these beasts isnt this illegal  I cant imagine the FAA allowing
people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes
Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down

And no Im not going to even think of buying one  Im not that crazy
