Subject japanese moon landing

Afraid I cant give any more info on this and hoping someone in greter
NETLAND has some details

A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
about how the Japanese using what sounded like a gravity assist had just
managed to crash or crashland a package on the moon

the article was very vague and unclear  and to make matters worse I
didnt clip it

does this jog anyones memory


thanks
