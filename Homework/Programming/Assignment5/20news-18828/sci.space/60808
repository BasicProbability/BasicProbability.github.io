Subject Re Big amateur rockets

Anyhow the ad stated that theyd sell rockets that were up to 20 in length
and engines of sizes F to M  They also said that some rockets will
reach 50000 feet

Now aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one
of these beasts isnt this illegal  I cant imagine the FAA allowing
people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes

The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years
See the discussion of highpower rocketry in the recmodelsrockets
frequentlyaskedquestions list

This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy you need
proper certification  That can be had mostly through Tripoli the high
power analog of the NAR although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend
the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too

You need special FAA authorization but provided you arent doing it under
one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that its not
especially hard to arrange

As with model rocketry this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled
properly  Proper handling takes more care and you need a lot more empty
air to fly in but its basically just model rocketry scaled up  As with
model rocketry the highpower people use factorybuilt engines which
eliminates the major safety hazard of doityourself rocketry
