 Double wow  Can you land a shuttle with a 5cm hole in the wall
Personnally I dont know but Id like to try it sometime

Are you volunteering 

 But a
hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately deorbit
to the next available landing site

Will NASA have available landing sites in the Russian Republic now that they
are Our Friends and Comrades



    Software engineering Thats like military intelligence isnt it
