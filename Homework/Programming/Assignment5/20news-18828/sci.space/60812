Reply address markpradopermanetorg

If anyone knows anyone else who would like to get scispace
but doesnt have an Internet feed or has a cryptic Internet
feed I would be willing to feed it to them  I have a nice
offline message readereditor an automated modem mailer
program which will pick up mail bundles quickly and easily
and an INSTALLEXE to set them up painlessly  No charge for
the scispace feed though you have to dial Washington DC
This is NOT a BBS  its a store  forward system for mail
bundles with minimum connect times  Im used to overseas
calls  This is not an offer for a free feed for any other
particular newsgroups  Speeds of up to 14400 v32bis are
supported  VIPs might be offered other free services such
as Internet address and other functionality

I get my feed from UUNET and run a 4line hub  Ive been
hubbing for years  I have an extremely reliable hub

The software I provide runs under MSDOS and OS2 and Windows
as a DOS box  Other compatible software packages exist for
the MacIntosh and Unix

Any responses should be private and go to

By the way to all my apologies for the public traffic on my
glib question  I really didnt expect public replys  But thanks
to Bill Higgins for the interesting statistics and the lead
