I was reading Popular Science this morning and was surprised by an ad in
the back  I know that a lot of the ads in the back of PS are fringe
science or questionablely legal but this one really grabbed my attention
It was from a company name Personal Missle Inc or something like that

Anyhow the ad stated that theyd sell rockets that were up to 20 in length
and engines of sizes F to M  They also said that some rockets will
reach 50000 feet

Now aside from the obvious dangers to any amateur rocketeer using one
of these beasts isnt this illegal  I cant imagine the FAA allowing
people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes
Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down

And no Im not going to even think of buying one  Im not that crazy


Paul minell do 50000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite Dokas

Could it be Public Missile Inc in Michigan

From the description of ad here it sounds like theyre talking about
High Power Rocketry an outgrowth of model rocketry  This hobby
uses nonmetallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured
engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P  The hobby
has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular
Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry

Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 33 pounds OR using a
total impulse of G or greater REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch
Typically a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period
of time ie week weekend etc at a designated site and time and
all of the launches are then covered under this blanket waiver
There is also a High Power Safety Code which designates more
specific rules such as launch field size etc

Finally in order to purchase any of the larger Class B rocket 
motors you need to certified through either the National Association
of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association Certification procedures
require a demonstarted handling and safe flight at a total impulse
level
