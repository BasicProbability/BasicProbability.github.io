From another space forum
  NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS
    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS56
 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
 lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB  The tool survived
 the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250000 foot
 altitude then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC

    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media

    Its been a long time since something like this happened  Weve
 lost washers and bolts before but never a tool like this

    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
 Thiokol Corp technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
 April 2nd  Unfortunately the workers supervisor did not act on the
 report and Discovery was launched with its extra payload  NASA
 officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th
 launch date

    The freeflying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB
 technician  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster
 its 18inch long rope was still attached  The pliers were found in a
 part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad
Rons ed note  naaahhh  just too easy

    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that
 the Shuttle processor will take appropriate action  Thiokol is a
 subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch
