effect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the
recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
some sort rattling around apparently inside the case
I heard a similar statement in our local news UTAH tonight They referred
to the tool as the PLIERS that took a ride into space They also
said that a Thiokol sp employee had reported missing a tool of some kind
during assembly of one SRB

It was a test of the first reusable tool


I assume then that someone at Thiokol put on their managers hat and said
that pissing off the customer by delaying shipment of the SRB to look inside
it was a bad idea regardless of where that tool might have ended up

Why do I get the feeling that Thiokol managers hats are shaped like cones

Pointy so they can find them or so they will stick into their pants better and
be closer to their brains
