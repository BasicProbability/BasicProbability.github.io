A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
about how the Japanese using what sounded like a gravity assist had just
managed to crash or crashland a package on the moon

The Japanese spacecraft Hiten crashed on the Moon last weekend  For the
past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some
aerobraking experiments with Earths atmosphere  It was placed in lunar
orbit in February 1992 and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was
unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon
