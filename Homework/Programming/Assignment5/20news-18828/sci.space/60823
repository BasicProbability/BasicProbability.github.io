A short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
about how the Japanese using what sounded like a gravity assist had just
managed to crash or crashland a package on the moon

Their Hiten engineeringtest mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
Earth orbit doing lunar flybys and then was inserted into lunar orbit
using some very tricky gravityassistlike maneuvering  This meant that
it would crash on the Moon eventually since there is no such thing as
a stable lunar orbit as far as anyone knows and I believe I recall
hearing recently that it was about to happen


The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the secondorder perturbations in a
three body system  The probe was launched into this region for the
earthmoonsun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down The idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel well just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasnt interested but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldnt hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration

	This from an issue of Science News or The Planetary Report I
believe about 2 months ago

I read the newspaper today and was amazed that in 24 hours five billion
people could accomplish so little
