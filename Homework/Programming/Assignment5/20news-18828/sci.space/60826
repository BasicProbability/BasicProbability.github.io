allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down The idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel well just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasnt interested but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldnt hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration

Actually Hiten wasnt originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all
so it indeed didnt have much fuel on hand  The lunarorbit mission was
an afterthought after Hagoromo a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten
during a lunar flyby had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion
into lunar orbit couldnt be positively confirmed

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages  It takes
a long time and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit
If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit you do have
to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel although it is reduced from
what youd need for the bruteforce approach
