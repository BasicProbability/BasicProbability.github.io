  Would this work  I cant see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum especially given the mass of the pusher plate and it seems
to me youre going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
theyre there

The Orion concept as actually proposed as opposed to the way it has been
somewhat misrepresented in some fiction included wrapping a thick layer
of reaction mass  probably plastic of some sort  around each bomb
The bomb vaporizes the reaction mass and its that which transfers
momentum to the pusher plate
