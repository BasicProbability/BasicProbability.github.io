In the old days  their used to be Arbitron stats  that analyzed
the readership and posting volumes  by group  and user

They were available from UUNET   Thats how you check the
readership of Scispace  not some stupid  unscientific attempt
to  flood the newsgroup

I have abetter idea  WHy dont we all reply directly to the
origanator  of this post  and tell him we read scispace

	Sigh
	I try to make a little joke I try to inject some humour here
and what happens  In the immortal words of Foghorn Leghorn

	I say that was a joke son

	I thought that the bit about McElwaine not to mention the two
smileys would indicate to even the most humour impaired that I was
JOKING
	Sigh
	And will everyone who pats suggestion thanks bunches pat
please stop sending me email


  I shot a man just to watch him die         Ross Borden

Now I had put a Wink at the end of my suggestion indicating it was
intensely sarcastic  I cant help it if everyone got all serious

	I never saw your original posting  it dropped on the floor
somewhere  I just saw the trickle down thought it was intensely
stupid  not knowing anything about the joke mentioned arbitron
and left it with an equally stupid joke  Bill in his ever increasing
devotion to thoroughness dug up  several  arbitron stats

I myself think the arbitron stats are  severely methodologically impaired
but are a good measure of proportion  I dont think anyone
knows how many people read news anymore
