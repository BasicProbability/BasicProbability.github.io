Marshall is investigating a small but odd pressure rise in one SRB
during the Jan 12 Endeavour launch  It lasted only three seconds and
the thrust difference between the two SRBs was not enough to cause
nozzle gimballing  The SRB casing shows no abnormalities

Is this the one that had the wrenchpliers found inside after
recovery
