rlsuihepahepuiucedu Ray Swartz Oh that guy again writes

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the secondorder perturbations in a
three body system  The probe was launched into this region for the
earthmoonsun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down The idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel well just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasnt interested but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldnt hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration


I should probably repost this with another title so that
the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical
use of temporary orbits

Another possible temporary orbit


Phil Fraering         Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff
