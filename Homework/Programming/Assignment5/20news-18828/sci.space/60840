Subject Re Guns for Space


Okay lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun  
The project manager is Dr John Hunter and he works for the
Laser group at Livermore  What you may ask does gas guns
have to do with lasers Nothing really but the gun is physically
located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building
and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls
from which the gun firings are controlled  So I suspect that the
office he works for is an administrative convenience

I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb and we toured the gun
At the time I was working on gas gun RD at Boeing where I work
but I am now doing other things helping to save the space station

The gun uses a methaneair mixture which is burned in a chamber
about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID ie it looks like a pipe
The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several
hundred ms down the chamber  On the other side of the piston
is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens
of atmospheres

The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until
a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around 50000 psi
The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch
bore  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber ie they
intersect  This was done so that in the future the barrel
could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to
move the larger and heavier chamber  The projectile being used
in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic 4 in in diameter
and about 50 cm long

All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen
gas from 50000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the
barrel  The barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a
sheet of plastic film a little thicker than Saran wrap  The
plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped
in the barrel ahead of the projectile  

The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic
water jugs  In the early testing fragments of the plastic
projectile were found  At the higher speeds in later testing
the projectile vaporizes

The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is
about 3 miles across and the projectile would go 100200 km
if fired for maximum range  The intent is to move the whole gun
to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete where they can
fire into the Pacific Ocean and use the tracking radar at VAFB
to follow the projectiles

The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4
kms half of orbital speed  So far they have reached 2 kms
and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test
they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware I think it
had to do with the methaneair more detonating than burning but
I havent had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this

There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this
gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at Mach 12
4 kms since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8

This gun cost about 4 million to develop and is basically
a proofofconcept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful
sized payloads into space  This would require on the order of
100 kg projectiles which deliver on the order of 20 kg
useful payload to orbit
