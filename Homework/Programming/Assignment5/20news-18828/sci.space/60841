Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet their
ERL1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of 280000 psi  It has a density of 0058 lbcu in
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is 48 million inches or 400000 ft
or 75 Statute miles

Now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss
type or guy wires or both and will be used below the crush strength
Let us assume that we will operate at 40 of the theoretical 
strength  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant
section column  

A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up  For example let us say you have a 280000 pound
load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in
calculation  This requires 25 square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight  The mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh 9200 lb so at 1 mile 
below the payload the total load is now 289200 lb a 33 increase

The next mile of structure must be 33 thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload  Each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom  We can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at 40lb and how
much load you need to support on the ground for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support

Let us arbitrarily choose 1 billion as the limit in costruction
cost  With this we can afford perhaps 10000000 lb of composites
assuming our finished structure costs 100lb  The 40lb figure
is just for materials cost  Then we have a towerpayload mass
ratio of 3571  At a 33 mass ratio per mile the tower
height becomes 111 miles  This is clearly above the significant
atmosphere  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and glosses
will be almost eliminated  Glosses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity  Thus
they represent wasted thrust  Together with drag rockets starting
from the ground have a 15 velocity penalty to contend with

This analysis is simplified in that it does not consider wind
loads  These will require more structural support over the first
15 miles of height  Above that the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor
