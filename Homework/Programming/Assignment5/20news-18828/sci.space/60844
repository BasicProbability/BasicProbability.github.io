Solar coronal holes and recurrant aurora  for the past thirty years it would be
a big help  Or if you have information on more esoteric things like Telluric
current surge bafflers power companies use or other effects sporatic aurora
have on the Earths magnetic field Id be eternally gratefull  Please send
