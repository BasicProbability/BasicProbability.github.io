 I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
  Sails I understand that the JPL did an extensive study on the subject
  back in the late 70s but I am having trouble gathering such information
 
 Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project

I know someone had long talks about Solar Sails early this year and late last
yearAlso about Solar Sailing Not sure who captured it if possible

I think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data

I think I started the latest round or the late last year round But the topic
has been around here off and on for a year or two
