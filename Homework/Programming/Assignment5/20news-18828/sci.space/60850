  Background The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept

It was more than a theoretical concept it was seriously pursued by
Freeman Dyson et al many years ago I dont know how wellknown this is
but a high explosive Orion prototype flew in the atmosphere in San
Diego back in 1957 or 1958 I was working at General Atomic at the time
but I didnt learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later
when 
Ted Taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done I feel sure
that someone must have film of that experiment and Id really like to
see it Has anyone out there seen it

Leigh

Nope I havent seen the film but Taylors biography The Curve of 
Binding Energy contains a short section on Orion and this test flight
Apparently it was quite impressi and got von Braun very excited
