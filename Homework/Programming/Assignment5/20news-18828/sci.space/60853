Subject Re What if the USSR had reached the Moon first

This is turning into whats a moonbase good for and I ought
not to post when Ive a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic

Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
they will simply be able to afford more stuff
