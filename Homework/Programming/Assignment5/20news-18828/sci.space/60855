Subject Re army in space

ktjbeachcisufledu kerry todd johnson writes

 Is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the Army that deal
 with space  After I graduate I will have a commitment to serve in the Army
 and I would like to spend it in a spacerelated field  I saw a post a long
 time ago about the Air Force Space Command which made a fleeting reference to
 its Army counterpart  Any more info on that would be appreciated  Im 
 looking for things like do I branch Intelligence or Signal or other  To
 whom do I voice my interest in space  What qualifications are necessary
 Etc etc  BTW my major is computer science engineering

Kerry Im guessing a little at this because its been a few years 
since I saw the info but you will probably want to look at Air Defense 
Artillery as a specialty or possibly Signals  The kind of thing youre 
looking for is SDItype assignments but itll be pretty prosaic stuff
Things like hardkill ATBM missiles some of the COBRA rigs  that kind 
of thing  

Hope that gives you some ideas on where to look though
