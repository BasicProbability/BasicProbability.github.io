There is the Army Ballistic Missile Defense Organization

They were the precursors to SDIO  and still exist under
that umbrella  Army Signal Corps  and DCA  defense Comm Agency
oops  DISA they just changed names  do space work  thats
the point of all those defense comm sats  

But dont worry  there are lots of jobs that need ditch digging
somehow youll end up there
