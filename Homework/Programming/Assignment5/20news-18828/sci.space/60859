Subject A flawed propulsion system Space Shuttle



For an essay I am writing about the space shuttle and a need for a better
propulsion system  Through research I have found that it is rather clumsy 
ie all the checkstests before launch the safety hazards sitting
on a hydrogen bomb etc  If you have any beefs about the current
space shuttle program Re propulsion please send me your ideas

Thanks a lot
