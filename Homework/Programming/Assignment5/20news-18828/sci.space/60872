This is turning into whats a moonbase good for and I ought
not to post when Ive a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic

Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
they will simply be able to afford more stuff

If I read you right youre saying in essence that with a larger
economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste
on a lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military
scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have 
the money why not approach

Its conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose its possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose but its most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for 30 million a year Even if you
use grad students
