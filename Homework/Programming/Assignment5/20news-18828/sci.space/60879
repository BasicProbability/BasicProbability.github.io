 The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions  These
 are described by the inventor as exploiting the secondorder perturbations in a
 three body system  The probe was launched into this region for the
 earthmoonsun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
 allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
 down The idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without
 expending fuel well just find the trajectory that makes it possible The
 originator of the technique said that NASA wasnt interested but that Japan
 was because their probe was small and couldnt hold a lot of fuel for
 deceleration
 
 
 I should probably repost this with another title so that
 the guys on the other thread would see that this is a practical
 use of temporary orbits
 
 Another possible temporary orbit
 
 
 Phil Fraering         Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff

If you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained
you should try and find the following paper

     Hiroshi Yamakawa Junichiro Kawaguchi Nobuaki Ishii 
     and Hiroki Matsuo A Numerical Study of Gravitational Capture
     Orbit in the EarthMoon System AAS92186 AASAIAA Spaceflight
     Mechanics Meeting Colorado Springs Colorado 1992

The references included in this paper are quite interesting also and 
include several that are specific to the HITEN mission itself
