Subject Re Comet in Temporary Orbit Around Jupiter

  Can these questions be answered for a previous
  instance such as the Gehrels 3 that was mentioned in an earlier posting

 Orbital Elements of Comet 1977VII from Dance files

Thanks for the information

I assume p is the semimajor axis and e the eccentricity  The peri
helion and aphelion are then given by p1e and p1e ie about
290 and 395 AU respectively  For Jupiter they are 495 and 545 AU
If 1977 was after the temporary capture this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiters 
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiters influence

 Also perihelions of Gehrels3 were
 
 April  1973     83 jupiter radii
 August 1970     3 jupiter radii

Where 1 Jupiter radius  71000 km  44000 mi  00005 AU  So the
1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove
Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well
