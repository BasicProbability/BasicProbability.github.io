Later on the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some
of the worst pseudoscientific shows in TV history by flying Into Infinity
This was a oneoff thing done as part of BBCs educational SF series The
Day After Tomorrow The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of
reaching the speed of light lightship Altares the fourman crew 
eventually journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the 
galaxy I think I saw this as a 9yearold back in 1976 and liked it very 
much but then again I was a fan of SPACE1999 so I guess I was easily 
satisfied in those days

Wow  I was beginning to think that I had made that up  I remember that
movie it was about 15 hours long  I dont think they ended up anywhere
in the known universe  

I remember they got a message halfway out to Proxima Centauri that Earth
transmitted a day after they launched timed to catch up with them at the
halfway point  I thought it was neat I think I was all of 10 at the time

Does anyone know if Into Infinity has been released on video I have some
SPACE1999 shows on VHS and know that Thunderbirds etc also are available in
England
 
Space1999 has just come out with 4 episodes released in American stores
I will look for the Into Infinity show I never did know that was the
name of it I thought the show was called the day after tomorrow and
that was it
