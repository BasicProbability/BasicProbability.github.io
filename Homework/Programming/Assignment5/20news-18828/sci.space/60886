Subject NAVSTAR positions

Ive just read Richard Langleys latest Navstar GPS Constellation Status

It states that the latest satellite was placed in Orbit Plane Position C3
There is already one satellite in that position I know that its almost
ten years since that satellite was launched but its still in operation so
why not use it until it goes off

Why not instead place the new satellite at B4 since that position is empty
and by this measure have an almost complete GPSconstellation
23 out of 24
