             The Lunar Teleoperation Model One LTM1
             
                        By David H Mitchell
                          March 23 1993
 
INTRODUCTION
 
In order to increase public interest in spacebased and lunar operations a
real miniature lunarlike environment is being constructed on which to test
teleoperated models These models are remotelycontrolled by individuals
located worldwide using their personal computers for EduTainment
purposes
Not only does this provide a testbed for simple teleoperation and
telepresence activities but it also provides for the sharing of
information
on methods of operating in space including but not limited to layout of
a
lunar colony teleoperating machines for work and play disseminating
educational information providing contests and awards for creativity and
achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in
TwentyFirst century remote learning methods
 
Because of the nature of the LTM1 project people of all ages interests
and
skills can contribute scenery and murals models and structures
interfacing
and electronics software and graphics In operation LTM1 is an evolving
playground and laboratory that can be used by children students and
professionals worldwide Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at
a participating institution a user is able to teleoperate real models at
the
LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes Because a real
facility
exists ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the
construction
of the lunar model its operation and new features to be added as suggested
by the users themselves
 
This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups
  teleoperations and virtual reality research
  radio control model railroad and ham radio operation
  astronomy and space planetariums and science centers
  art and theater
  bbs and online network users
  software and game developers
  manufacturers and retailers of model rockets cars and trains
  children
  the child in all of us
 
LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN
 
A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout The walls are used
for murals of distant moon mountains star fields and a view of the earth
The floor is the simulated lunar surface A global call for contributions
is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and
creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and
machinelets
 
 The LTM1 initial design has 3 teleoperated machinelets
 1 An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land
 2 A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and
 3 A moontrain which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface
 
 Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on
 it A personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture
 content and doing datacompression to allow for minimal images to be sent
 to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals
 
The first machinelet to be set up will be the moontrain since model trains
with TV cameras built in are almost offtheshelf items and control
electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal The user will
receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their
data link to LTM1
 
Next an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a
servomotor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the
SSTO
to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar
landscape and land
 
Finally some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped
bulldozerlets The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators
worldwide
to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and
takeoff traveling and doing work The entire system is based on
commercially
available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the
interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced
ham radio operator and computer hardwaresoftware developers
 
By taking a graphically oriented communications program Dmodem and adding
a teleoperations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be
provided in under 80 man hours
 
PLAN OF ACTION
 
The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by
providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network
Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction
of the lunar model Diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be
modified and one CCD TV chip Diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock
for the lunar train model Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical
communications package and modify it for control of the machineslets
An initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for
a live photosession and news conference on April 30 1993 The initial
models will be put in place A timelapse record will be started for
historical purposes It is not expected that this event will be completely
serious or solemn The lunar colony will be declared open for additional
building operations and experiments A photographer will be present and
the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution
worldwide to major online networks and bbss A press release will be
issued
calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale
models
for the simulated lunar colony
 
A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then
be
announced Universities will be invited to participate the goal being to
find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of
the lunar colony model Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that
time
the results of the class work will be added to the model Contributors will
then be able to teleoperate any contributed machinelets once they return
to
their campus
 
A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via
conventional means to the media Any major new teleoperated equipment
addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media
Having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo
opportunity for the television community Especially since the action
will
be controlled by people all over the world Science fiction writers will be
invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at
universities to build and operate the teleoperated equipment to perform
lunar tasks Using counterweight and pulley systems 16 gravity may be
simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges
 
The long term goal is creating worldwide interest education
experimentation
and remote operation of a lunar colony LTM1 has the potential of being a
long
term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic
example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited
to space EduTainment All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can
lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars
 
CONCLUSION
 
EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment Anyone who has
ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a
globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation
purposes By creating a teleoperated model lunar colony we not only create
worldwide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require
real
not virtual skills and open a new method for putting peoples minds in
space
