 I feel sure
that someone must have film of that experiment and Id really like to
see it Has anyone out there seen it

Ive seen a film of it my memory may be faulty but as I
remember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long with a
thick baseplate 3040 cm in diameter I think the narrative said
it was propelled by dynamite sticks There were four detonations
within about 2 s the second coming after about 2 m of flight in
Max altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m but that is hard 
to judge
