  Can these questions be answered for a previous
  instance such as the Gehrels 3 that was mentioned in an earlier posting

 Also perihelions of Gehrels3 were
 
 April  1973     83 jupiter radii
 August 1970     3 jupiter radii
 
 Where 1 Jupiter radius  71000 km  44000 mi  00005 AU  So the
 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove
 Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well
  
Sorry perijovesIm not used to talking this language
