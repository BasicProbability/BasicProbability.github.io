Why is everyone being so critical of B2
 Because its bogus science promoted as real science
It seems to me that its sorta a large engineering project more
then a science project
  Bingo
B2 is not bench science  but rather a large scale attempt to

 Nothing evil at all Theres no actual harm in what theyre doing only
