   My understanding is that the expected errors are basically
   known bugs in the warning system software  things are checked
   that dont have the right values in yet because they arent
   set till after launch and suchlike Rather than fix the code
   and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew
   ok if you see a warning no 213 before liftoff ignore it

Good grief And I thought the Shuttle software was known for being
wellengineered If this is actually the case every member of the
programming team should be taken out and shot

given that Ive heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in
maturity I strongly doubt that this is the case
