Subject Re Why not give 1 billion to first yearlong moon residents

Gene Wright genetheporchraidernet wrote
 Announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation 
 who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year 
 Then youd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin 
 to be developed THered be a different kind of space race then

Im an advocate of this idea for funding Space Station work and I
throw around the 1 billion figure for that reward  I suggest that
you increase the Lunar reward to about 3 billion

This would encourage private industry to invest in space which 
should be one of NASAs primary goals
