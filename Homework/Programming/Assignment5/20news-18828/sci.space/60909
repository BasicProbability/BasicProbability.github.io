Subject Re Why not give 1 billion to first yearlong moon residents

In article 6ZV82B2w165wtheporchraidernet genetheporchraidernet Gene Wright writes
 With the continuin talk about the End of the Space Age and complaints 
 by government over the large cost why not try something I read about 
 that might just work
 
 Announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation 
 who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year 
 Then youd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin 
 to be developed THered be a different kind of space race then
