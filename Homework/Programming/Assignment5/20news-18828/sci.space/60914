Subject Space Station radio commercial

A brief politicalcultural item

Radio station WGMS in Washington is a classical music station with
a large audience among high officials elected and otherwise  
Imagine a radio station that advertises Mercedes Benzes diamond
jewelry expensive resorts and truthfully Trident submarines

This morning I heard a commercial for the space station project
Didnt catch the advertiser

Guess theyre pulling out all the stops
