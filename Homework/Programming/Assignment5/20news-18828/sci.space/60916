  With the continuin talk about the End of the Space Age and complaints 
  by government over the large cost why not try something I read about 
  that might just work
  
  Announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation 
  who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year 
  Then youd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin 
  to be developed THered be a different kind of space race then

 resources and do it Maybe make it a prize kind of liek the Solar Car Race
