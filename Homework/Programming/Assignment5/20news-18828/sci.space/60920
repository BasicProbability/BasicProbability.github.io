Subject Re Space Debris

 Keesler Loftus Potter Stansbery Kubriek

I gues it is Keesler The others do not ring the bell but they might be 
involved as well Sometime ago Keesler was here at Langley teaching 
a course on space debris and if my memory does not fail I think there
was even a reference to a book on the subject
