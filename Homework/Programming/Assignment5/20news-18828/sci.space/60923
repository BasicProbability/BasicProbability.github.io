Subject Re Why not give 1 billion to first yearlong moon residents

In article 6ZV82B2w165wtheporchraidernet genetheporchraidernet Gene Wright writes

   Announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation 
   who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a
   year 

And with 1B on offer the problem of keeping them alive is highly
likely to involve more than just the lunar environment 

Oh Dear my freighter just landed on the roof of ACMEs base and they
all died  How sad  Gosh that leaves us as the oldest residents

Quick Boss the slime from YoyoDyne are back and this time theyve
got a tank  Man the guns

One could imagine all sorts of technologies being developed in that
sort of environment

Greg

Im kidding BTW although the problem of winnertakesall prizes is
that it encourages all sorts of undesirable behaviour  witness
military procurement programs  And 1b is probably far too small a
reward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk
proposition
