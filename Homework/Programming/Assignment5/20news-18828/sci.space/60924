AWST  had a brief blurb on a Manned Lunar Exploration confernce
May 7th  at Crystal City Virginia under the auspices of AIAA

Does anyone know more about this  How much to attend

A good summary has been posted thanks but I wanted to add another comment
I remeber reading the comment that General Dynamics was tied into this in 
connection with their proposal for an early manned landing  Sorry I dont 
rember where I heard this but Im fairly sure it was somewhere reputable 
Anyone else know anything on this angle

Hrumph  They didnt send me anything
