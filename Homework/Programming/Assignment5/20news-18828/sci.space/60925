   We publish plenty kiddoyou just have to look


Never said you didnt publish merely that there is data you dont
publish  and that noone scoriates you for those cases  

IBM research  publishes plenty its why you ended up  with 2 Nobel
prizes in the last 10 years  but that some projects are deemed
company confidential  ATT Bell Labs  keeps lots of stuff private
Like Karamankars algorithm  Private moeny is entitled to do what
it pleases within the bounds of Law  and For all the keepers of the
temple of SCience  should please shove their pointy little heads
up their Conically shaped Posterior Orifices
