Subject Looking for a little research help


Hi
  
  Im writing a science fiction script and Im looking for some
answers to questions regarding the Moon and Earth My starting point
is an impossible situation  I checked with a professor at berkeley
and his response was a VERY helpful cant happen If you enjoy
playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions
please contact me via email jennisedgicom

  I get extremely annoyed when screen and teleplays ignore basic
facts about computers that Im determined to be as scientifically
accurate as I can


  Sorry for being vague but Id like to protect my idea as much as I
can until Im ready to sell it hopefully
