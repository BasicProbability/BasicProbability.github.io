ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56

Flight V56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS601 series 
Galaxy IV satellite but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight

The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE 
satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit GTO with 
inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km
This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L 
configuration with 2 liquid strapon boosters PAL  It will be launched
from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2 in Kourou  French 
Guiana

The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3147 kg
of which 2944 kg represents the satellite mass  The total vehicle mass
at liftoff is 361778 kg


Required Orbit Characteristics
  Perigee Altitude  200 km
  Apogee Altitude  36160 km at injection 
  Inclination    5 degrees


The Ariane 42L liftoff for Flight 56 is scheduled on Thursday
April 29 1993 as soon as possible within the following launch 
window

LAUNCH VEHICLE

Ariane 42L  This is a threestage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid 
fueled strapon boosters  The first stage L220 is built by Aerospatiale
and is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines  The second stage L33
is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine  Both the
Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP  The first and second stages
use a biliquid UH25N2O4 fuel The third stage H10 is built by Aerospatiale
and is powered by a cryogenic H2O2 fueled HM7B engine built by SEP The two
strapon boosters PAL are each powered by a Viking VI engine also built 
by SEP which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages  
The fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad  
It uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing

LAUNCH COVERAGE

All Ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from Kourou 
Coverage begins at 30 minutes before launch and continues until 
all payloads have been deployed  This mission will likely be carried
in the US on Galaxy 6 however it could be Galaxy 7 or another satellite
What is the European satellite normally used for Ariane coverage
