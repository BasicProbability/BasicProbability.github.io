Lets play a game  What would be a reasonable reward  What companies would
have a reasonable shot at pulling off such a feat  Just where in the
budget would the reward come from  Should there be a time limit  Would a
straight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say   
exclusive mining rights for the first fifty years You get the idea
 A cash award is OK A time limit would be nice You cant give away
mining rights assuming theres anything to mine because you dont own
them
 
 sig files are like strings  every yoyos got one
