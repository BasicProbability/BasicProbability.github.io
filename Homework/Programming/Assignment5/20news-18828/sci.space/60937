If anyone knows anyone else who would like to get scispace
but doesnt have an Internet feed or has a cryptic Internet
feed I would be willing to feed it to them	

	Kudos to Mark for his generous offer but there already exists a
large emailbased forwarding system for scispace posts  Space Digest
It mirrors scispace exactly and provides simple twoway communication

I think Mark was talking about making it available to people who didnt
have email in the first place

If anybody in the Boston area wants a scispace feed by honesttogosh UUCP
no weird offline malreaders let me know  Ill also hand out logins to
anyone who wants one especially the Boston Chapter of NSS which I keep forgetting
to reattend
