This is turning into whats a moonbase good for and I ought
not to post when Ive a hundred some odd posts to go but I would
think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic
Since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much
larger GNP than they would without space industry eventually
they will simply be able to afford more stuff

If I read you right youre saying in essence that with a larger
economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste
on a lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military
scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have
the money why not approach

I was assuming that there wont be a moon base unless it makes a
profit actually  If it does well that gives a larger GNP which
leads to being able to spend more money on your military including
goshwow space stuff  assuming its profitable rather than paying
for itself

Its conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose its possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose but its most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for 30 million a year Even if you
use grad students

You might be able to run one for that put it there hardly

Why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will
be significant commerical activity on the Moon
