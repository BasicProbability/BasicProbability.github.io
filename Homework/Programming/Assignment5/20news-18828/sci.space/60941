Subject Jemison on Star Trek

   I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr Mae Jemison the first
black woman in space shes a physician and chemical engineer who flew
on Endeavour last year will appear as a transporter operator on the
Star Trek The Next Generation episode that airs the week of May 31
Its hardly space science I know but its interesting
