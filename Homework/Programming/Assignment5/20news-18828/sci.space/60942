Subject Re Russian Email Contacts

It is usually possible to reach people at IKI Institute for Space
Research in Moscow by writing to

	IKIMAILesoc1bitnet

This is a machine at ESA in Darmstadt Germany IKI has a dedicated
phone line to this machine and someone there logs in regularly to
retrieve mail

In addition there are several user accounts belonging to Russian
scientific institutions on

	usersovamcom

which is a commercial enterprise based in San Francisco that provides
email services to the former USSR  For example fiansovamcom is the
PHysics Institute of the Academy of Sciences initials transliterated
from Russian of course  These connections cost the Russians real
dollars even for received messages so please dont send anything
voluminous or frivilous
