4  On Monday morning April 19 the moon will occult Venus and
interrupt the tracking of Magellan for about 68 minutes

Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on 

The gravity data is collected in realtime and it not recorded to the tape
recorder  However you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th
orbit so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for
a short while

BTW When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan Not that I am
looking forward to that day but I am just curious I believe it had something
to do with the funding from the goverment or rather NO funding 

The aerobraking starts May 25 and is expected last about 70 days  If the
funding is provided 8 million dollars to extend the mission for the
high resolution gravity data then the mission will last through October 1994
Otherwise the mission will end this coming July
