 I remeber reading the comment that General Dynamics was tied into this in 
 connection with their proposal for an early manned landing  Sorry I dont 
 rember where I heard this but Im fairly sure it was somewhere reputable 
 Anyone else know anything on this angle

The General Chairman is Paul Bialla who is some official of General
Dynamics

The emphasis seems to be on a scaleddown fast plan to put people
on the Moon in an impoverished spaceflightfunding climate Youd
think it would be a golden opportunity to do lots of precusor work for
modest money using an agressive series of robot spacecraft but
theres not a hint of this in the brochure

 Hrumph  They didnt send me anything 

Youre not hanging out with the Right People apparently
