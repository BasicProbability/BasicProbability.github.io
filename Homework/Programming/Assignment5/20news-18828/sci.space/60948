This prize isnt big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists

Actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough
to do SSTO development if done privately as a cutrate operation  Of
course they may be overoptimistic

You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications
that would help pay for its development costs

Id be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger but 1G might be enough
