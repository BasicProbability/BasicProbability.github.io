Its conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose its possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose but its most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least Therefore Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for 30 million a year Even if you
use grad students

You might be able to run one for that put it there hardly

Why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will
be significant commerical activity on the Moon

Wishful thinking mostly Its more likely that the Moon will never
be the site of major commercial activity As far as we know it has no
materials we cant get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
and comets aside from the semimythic He3 that might be useful in low
grade fusion reactors Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch 
and its position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with its heat 
sink capacity could offer some military utility for high ground military
weapons systems but it holds very minute commercial value If space 
travel becomes cheap enough it might become a tourist attraction as 
Mt Everest and the Antarctic have become but thats a very minor 
activity in the global scope of things

Luna has an inconvienent gravity field Its likely too low to prevent
calcium loss muscle atrophy and long term genetic drift Yet its
too high to do microG manufacturing Space based colonies and factories
that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better Luna
has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month but orbital
sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure Luna offers
a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials heatsink
and shielding The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
heavy elements and volatile compounds and many are in less steep gravity
wells so that less deltav is required to reach them

We dont use 23rds of the Earth now the seafloors and we virtually
ignore Antarctica a whole continent Thats because we dont have to
deal with those conditions in order to make a buck Luna is a much more
expensive place to visit or to live and work I think well use the
easier places first That pushes Lunar development back at least a few
centuries if not much longer

Lunas main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
astronomy observatory shielded from the noisy Earth Or as the site
of a laser particle beam or linear accelerator weapons system for
defending Earth or bombarding it as the case may be The first is
unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument
The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
enough and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for
conventional warfare again Theres little glory in watching from a
bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges Little
ultimate profit either
