   If I read you right youre saying in essence that with a larger
   economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a
   lunar facility That was certainly partially the case with Apollo
   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a we have the money why not approach

Ah but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon Its not like theyd be using 1000 1000R bills
to fuel their moondozers The money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged Its a way of funding
hightech research just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to
fund research under the pretense that its good for panEuropean
cooperation

Now maybe you think that governmentfunded research is a waste of
money in fact Im pretty sure you do but it does count as
investment spending which does boost the economy and just look at
the size of that multiplier 

Actually I favor government funded research It is a pump prime
for a lot of basic technologies I also understand the short term
value of high tech welfare programs But they cant substitute for
long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise Thats whats
needed to maintain a healthy economy anywhere on Earth or Luna
I dont see that long term potential on Luna due to a bunch of
factors I outline in another post
