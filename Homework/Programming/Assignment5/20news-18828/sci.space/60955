 The National Air  Space Museum has both the prototype and the film

   However quite possibly its
 no longer on display NASM like most museums has much more stuff than it
 can display at once and does rotate the displays occasionally

The NASM photo archives are open to the public  All or almost all
still pictures in the collection are available for viewing but I
dont know about films  At least it might be worth a try  Im not
sure if appointments are necessary but I think not

Good luck and let us know what you find
