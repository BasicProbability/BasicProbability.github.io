I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
 Sails

I was at an interesting seminar at work UKs RAL Space Science
Dept on this subject specifically on a smallscale Solar Sail
proposed as a student space project The guy giving the talk was keen to
generate interest in the project Ill typein the handout he gave out at
the meeting Here goes  

Stuff deleted 

However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most
people realize The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per
square kilometer                                            

Im glad to see that someone is working on this  However it would be nice if
he got his units right
