 I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
  Sails 
 Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project 

Sure  Contact the World Space Foundation  Theyre listed in the scispace
Frequently Asked Questions file which Ill excerpt

    spacecraft for longer than any similar group many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project WSF also provides partial funding for the

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails Project Solar Sail  I think Robert
Staehle David Brin  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me help me out Josh
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in The Starflight Handbook as well as
quite a few references


Check the following articles in Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society

Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of
reprints I just found the file

And K Eric Drexlers paper High Performance Solar Sails and Related
Reflecting Devices AIAA paper 791418 probably in a book called
Space Manufacturing maybe the proceedings of the Second 
Conference on Space Manufacturing  The 1979 one at any rate
