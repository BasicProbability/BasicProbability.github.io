Subject Commercial mining activities on the moon

  be the site of major commercial activity As far as we know it has no
  materials we cant get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
  and comets aside from the semimythic He3 that might be useful in low
  grade fusion reactors

I dont know what a low grade fusion reactor is but the major
problem with 3He aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
reactor work is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
small  on the order of 5 ppb or so on average more in some
fractions but still very small  Massive amounts of regolith would
have to be processed

This thread reminds me of Wingos claims some time ago about the moon
as a source of titanium for use on earth  As I recall Wingo wasnt
content with being assured that titanium at 5 in the Earths crust
average would not run out and touted lunar mines even though the
market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around 06pound
This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources

On the moon titanium occurs in basalts highTi basalts Apollo 11
and 17 have 814 titanium dioxide by weight  This is nice but
terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in
titanium  They very often have 3 TiO2 frequently have 4 and
sometimes even 5 TiO2 again by weight  These flood basalts are
enormous  millions of cubic kilometers scattered all over the
world Siberia Brazil the NW United States Ethiopia etc  If
even 1 of the basalts are 5 TiO2 this is trillions of tons of TiO2
at concentrations only a factor of 23 less than in lunar highTi
basalts  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
ore never mind the richer but less common terrestrial ores being
mined today
