Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  For
example Why couldnt Magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  

It can be but the problem is a political one not a technical one
