 The NASM photo archives are open to the public  All or almost all
 still pictures in the collection are available for viewing but I
 dont know about films  At least it might be worth a try  Im not
 sure if appointments are necessary but I think not

Is posible to make copies of these photographs or any other aerospace
photographs at NASM if you pay a copyright fee
