  Also perihelions of Gehrels3 were
  
  April  1973     83 jupiter radii
  August 1970     3 jupiter radii
  
  Where 1 Jupiter radius  71000 km  44000 mi  00005 AU  So the
  1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove
  Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well
   
 Sorry perijovesIm not used to talking this language

Hmmmm  The prefix peri is Greek not Latin so its usually used
with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited  Thats why
its perihelion rather than perisol perigee rather than periterr
and pericynthion rather than perilune  So for Jupiter Id expect it
to be something like perizeon
