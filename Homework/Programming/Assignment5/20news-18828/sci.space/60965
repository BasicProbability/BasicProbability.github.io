Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo
What would be the benefits and problems with such a combo other
than the obvious instability in the XSSR now

 I know you believe you understand what it is that you           
 think I said  But I am not sure that you realize that        
 what I said is not what I meant
