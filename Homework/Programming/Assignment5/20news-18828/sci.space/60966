     be the site of major commercial activity As far as we know it has no
     materials we cant get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
     and comets aside from the semimythic He3 that might be useful in low
     grade fusion reactors

   problem with 3He aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
   reactor work is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
   small  on the order of 5 ppb or so on average more in some

   This thread reminds me of Wingos claims some time ago about the moon
   as a source of titanium for use on earth  As I recall Wingo wasnt
 
   even 1 of the basalts are 5 TiO2 this is trillions of tons of TiO2
   at concentrations only a factor of 23 less than in lunar highTi
   basalts  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
   could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
   ore never mind the richer but less common terrestrial ores being
   mined today

Why Paul its obvious
Once chlorine chemistry has been banned on Earth
as is being advocated by some groups Ti prices will
sharply increase we are of course not allowed to
assume any developments in Ti processing
Lunar Ti will then be eminently competitive for
the trendy jewelry market and certain applications
of National Importance 

   


oops this is scispace wrong rules of debate 


Seriously Id say there is a flaw in Garys analysis
in that he assumes an export oriented economy maybe
the lunatics will just want some native Ti for local
use as to why Lunar natives are cost effective 
analysis has shown they will be critical in providing
a sheltered manufacturing base technological innovation
critical materials and manpower in the war between
the Allies and Central Powers in about two hundred years
