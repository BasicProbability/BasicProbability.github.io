This prize isnt big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
enough to do it if the vehicle exists

Actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough
to do SSTO development if done privately as a cutrate operation  Of
course they may be overoptimistic

You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications
that would help pay for its development costs

Id be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger but 1G might be enough

this all sounds like that Indecent Proposal movie  wouldnt there be
a lot of people that would try this with little hope of working just
to get the dough  if you have a 1100 chance and it costs you 10Mil
then you might pay some stooge a few grand to be your lucky hero
just send up a few dozen and 1 is bound to survive enough to make YOU
rich
