 I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar
  Sails 
 Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project 

Bill says 

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me help me out Josh

I presume the one you refer to is Space Sailing by Jerome L Wright  He 
worked on solar sails while at JPL and as CEO of General Astronautics  Ill
furnish ordering info upon request

The Friedman book is called Starsailing Solar Sails and Interstellar Travel
It was available from the Planetary Society a few years ago I dont know if
it still is
