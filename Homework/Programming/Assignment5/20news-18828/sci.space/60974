Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo


I dont know a whole lot on Proton but given that it is a multi stage
rocket  up to 4 stages it may not really need the Centaur  plus
it may end up seriously beating on said centaur   

Also the centaur is not small  unless the Proton has an oversize
shroud you may not be able to get the centaur in under it

Dennis  you know much about this
