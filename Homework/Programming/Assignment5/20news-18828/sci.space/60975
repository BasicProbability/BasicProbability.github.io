I love the idea of an inflatable 1mile long sign It will be a
really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt  or even better a
Westford Needle comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec  

BOOM  Whooooooooshhhhhh  sputter sputter

I hear insert favorite rumor here that it will supposedly coincide
with the Atlanta Olympics
