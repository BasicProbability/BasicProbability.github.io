  Announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation 
  who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year 
 
Oh gee a billion dollars  Thatd be just about enough to cover the cost of the
feasability study  Happy Happy JOY JOY
 
 Depends If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC on billion
  would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the
 moon If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the
 transfer vehicle you could send a lot more Either way its a lot
 more than needed
 
 This prize isnt big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
 enough to do it if the vehicle exists
