Subject Re Jemison on Star Trek

In article C5sB3pIB9fs7ececmuedu lossfs7ECECMUEDU Doug Loss writes
    I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr Mae Jemison the first
 black woman in space shes a physician and chemical engineer who flew
 on Endeavour last year will appear as a transporter operator on the
 Star Trek The Next Generation episode that airs the week of May 31
 Its hardly space science I know but its interesting

Interesting is rigth I wonder if they will make a mention of her being an
astronaut in the credits I think it might help people connect the future of
space with the present And give them an idea that we must go into space
