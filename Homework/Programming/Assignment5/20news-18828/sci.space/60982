WHATS NEW in my opinion Friday 16 April 1993  Washington DC

1 SPACE BILLBOARDS IS THIS ONE THE SPINOFFS WE WERE PROMISED
What about light pollution in observations I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day leave alone at night
Is NASA really supporting this junk
Are protesting groups being organized in the States
Really really depressed

I wouldnt worry about it  Theres enough space debris up there that
a milelong inflatable would probably deflate in some very short
period of time less than a year while cleaning up LEO somewhat
Sort of a giant flypaper in orbit

Hmm that could actually be useful

As for advertising  sure why not  A NASA friend and I spent one
drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar wed need
to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization
on the face of the Moon  Fortunately we sobered up in the morning
