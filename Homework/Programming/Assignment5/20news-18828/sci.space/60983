Subject Lunar Colony Race By 2005 or 2010

Okay here is what I have so far

Have a group any size preferibly small but send a human being to the moon
set up a habitate and have the humans spend one earth year on the moon Does
that mean no resupply or  

Need to find atleast 1billion for prize money

Contest open to different classes of participants

New Mexico State has semichallenged University of Alaska any branch to put a
team together and to do it
Any other UniversityCollegeInstitute of Higher Learning wish to make a
counter challenge or challenge another school Say it here

I like the idea of having atleast a russian team


Some prefer using new technology others old or 

The basic idea of the New Moon Race is like the Solar Car Race acrossed
Australia Atleast in that basic vein of endevour

Any other suggestions
