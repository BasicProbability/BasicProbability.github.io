 Thanks again  One final question  The name Gehrels wasnt known to
 me before this thread came up but the May issue of Scientific American
 has an article about the Inconstant Cosmos with a photo of Neil
 Gehrels project scientist for NASAs Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
 Same person

I would guess not  Dr Neil Gehrels of CGRO is the son of Dr Tom
Gehrels of the University of Arizona  Since hes long had research
interests in asteroids and other solarsystem astronomy Tom is the
one more likely to have discovered  a comet and thus had his name
attached to it

Tom Gehrels is a leader in the Spacewatch project which has recently
increased mankinds discovery rate on nearEarth asteroids theyre
finding a couple every month  For much more on this interesting guy
read his autobiography On a Glassy Sea
