 Okay here is what I have so far
 
 Have a group any size preferibly small but send a human being to the moon
 set up a habitate and have the humans spend one earth year on the moon Does
 that mean no resupply or  
 
 Need to find atleast 1billion for prize money


My first thought is Ross Perot  After further consideration I think hed
be more likely to try to win itbut come in a disappointing third

Try Bill Gates  Try Sam Waltons kids
