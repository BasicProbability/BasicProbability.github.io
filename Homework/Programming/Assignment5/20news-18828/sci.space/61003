Subject Lindbergh and the moon wasWhy not give 1G

All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race ie 1G to the first 1year 
moon base is intriguing Similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
development before The 25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of 
Saint Louis venture to his financial backers

If memory serves the 25k prize would not have been enough to totally 
reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects such as 
Fokkers Nungesser and other multiengine projects However Lindbergh 
ultimately kept his total costs below that amount

But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to 
realize that much more was at stake than 25000

Could it work with the moon Who are the farsighted financial backers of 
today
