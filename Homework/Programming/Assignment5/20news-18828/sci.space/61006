 Need to find atleast 1billion for prize money

My first thought is Ross Perot  After further consideration I think hed
be more likely to try to win itbut come in a disappointing third
Try Bill Gates  Try Sam Waltons kids

When the Lunar Societys 500M estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was
mentioned at Making Orbit somebody asked Jerry Pournelle have you talked
to Bill Gates  The answer  Yes  He says that if he were going to
sink that much money into it hed want to run it  and he doesnt have
the time

Somebody then asked him about Perot  Answer  Having Ross Perot on your
board may be a bigger problem than not having the money
