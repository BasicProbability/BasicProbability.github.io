Subject Re Lindbergh and the moon wasWhy not give 1G

In article 1r3nuvINNjeplynxunmedu cookvarmitmdccom Layne Cook writes
 All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race ie 1G to the first 1year 
 moon base is intriguing Similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
 development before The 25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of 
 Saint Louis venture to his financial backers
 But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to 
 realize that much more was at stake than 25000
 Could it work with the moon Who are the farsighted financial backers of 
 today

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between alreadysettled
andcivilized areas are obvious  Spaceflight is NOT in this position
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the 30s but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery  It didnt require govt to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination  In practice some were govt funded some were private
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop
and large numbers of people will live and work offEarth  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base I
cant give them  We just dont know enough  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries
will be when they will practical how much will have to be invested to
start them etc
