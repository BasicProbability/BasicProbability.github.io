There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life

Not quite true  One of the instruments on Mars Observer will be searching
for potential fossil sites   

Are we going back to Mars to look at this face agian
 
Mars Observer currently approaching Mars will probably try to get a better
image or two of the face at some point  Its not high priority nobody
takes it very seriously  The shadowed half of the face does not look very
facelike so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin
the illusion

The face and the Viking landing sites will be targeted by the highresolution
camera on Mars Observer
