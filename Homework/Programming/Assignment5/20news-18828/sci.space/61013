Subject Re First Spacewalk

At one time there was speculation that the first spacewalk 
Alexei Leonov  was a staged fake

Has any evidence to support or contradict this claim emerged 

Was this claim perhaps another fevered Cold War hallucination 

This claim was made when someone spotted training film footage spliced into
the footage of the actual spacewalk
