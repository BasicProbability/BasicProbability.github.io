Subject Re Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts

Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts  For
example Why couldnt Magellan just be told to go into a safe
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a lowpoweruse mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better hopefully it could be turned on again  

One consideration to remember is that if you dont turn it off now
you may not be able to later  This isnt a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a turn off command successfully  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off
