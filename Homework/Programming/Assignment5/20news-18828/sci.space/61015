Has anyone looked into the possiblity of a ProtonCentaur combo

I dont know a whole lot on Proton but given that it is a multi stage
rocket  up to 4 stages it may not really need the Centaur  plus
it may end up seriously beating on said centaur   

The Proton has been used in 2 3 and 4 stage versions  The two stage version
was used for the first 3 launches while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used
today  The four stage version is used mostly for escape and geosynchronous
orbits while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits  Since this is
the version that launched Mir and the Salyuts and the addon modules for Mir
as long as Centaur is smaller than Mir which I believe it is it should fit
under the shroud

I vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2LOX upper stage for the
Proton
