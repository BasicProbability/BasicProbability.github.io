In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of I think their
cost estimates are a bit overoptimistic If nothing else a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development That puts it in the 3G to 5G
range

	dont forget  a HUGE  cost for airliner developement is FAA
certification  the joke is when the paperwork  exceeds teh weight
of the airplane  it will fly

The SR71 and teh X15  both highly ambitious  aerospace projects were done
on very narrow engineering budgets   Partly because they didnt spend much
on paper  pushing   There is some company in missouri  trying to
get funding to build light commercial transporters  on a low cost basis
mostly by reducing FAA  certification costs
