orbiting billboard

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth
you need a deltav of 25 kms  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fueloxidizer

Unfortunately if you launch this from the US or are a US citizen
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for
an antisatellite weapon 

The threshold at which OCST licensing kicks in is roughly 100km
The rules are actually phrased in more complex ways but that is
the result
