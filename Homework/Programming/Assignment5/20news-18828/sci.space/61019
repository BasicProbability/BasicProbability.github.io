 This prize isnt big enough to warrent developing a SSTO but it is
 enough to do it if the vehicle exists
 
 Actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough
 to do SSTO development if done privately as a cutrate operation  Of
 course they may be overoptimistic
 
 In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of I think their
 cost estimates are a bit overoptimistic If nothing else a working SSTO
 is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
 base It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
 much as a typical airliner development That puts it in the 3G to 5G
 range
 

For the purpose of a contest Id bet some things could be cut  Like fuel
for reentry any kind of heat shielding etc etc  Even still if the
contest participants had to fund DC1 development it probably wouldnt be
worth it to develop DC1 just for the contest  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated or at least under 6 or so Gs booster  If I
dont have to pay for DC1 development great Ill use it

But back to the contest goals there was a recent article in AWST about a
low cost its all relative manned return to the moon  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV  Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage LEV and crew capsule  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission 
Total cost  US was 1013 billion  Joint ESANASA project was 69
billion for the US share

I didnt find a mention of how long the crew could stay but Id bet that
its  around 30 days  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
tonnes  So if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module no return trip and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another 11 months then you might be
able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes and in case its not obvious
thats a wild ass guess  A pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX  And Im not certain if a home brewed or
collegebrewed life support system could last a year  But lets round
this up to 194 tonnes convient since the GD plan talks about 97 ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface  This adds up to two Centaurs two
LEVs two Shuttle flights All to put a single man on the moon for a
year   Hmmm  Not really practical  Anyone got a cheaperbetter way of
delivering 1520 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a years supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh

And I was wondering about the GD LEV  Is it reusable  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO  If its not discarded could it be refueled 
Henry Do you know anything about the GD LEV  I noted that it uses RL10
engines  Arent they reusablerestartable  Would a LEV fit in a DC1 
Ive forgotten if I ever knew what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC1

All in all Im not certain that the single goalprize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise andor useful  How about  A prize for the first
nongovernment sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a manned
moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil another for a reusable earthmoon shuttle and so forth  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win  And for those that didnt give up I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters  Id
like to see as much a reward for cooperation as for competition

Lastly about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an ongoing discussion about moonbases on
the cheap  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced how much lunar material itd need for protection from solar
flares etc  Unfortunately I dont remember the name of this magazine 
Does this ring a bell to anyone
