There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings in May and July  Please spread the word  Heres some
information about the events and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus  He might also have
some money available

Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturns rings and Saturn
itself on 1993050102 18271343 UT and again on 1993072021
21160938 UT  Timing is as follows

     1993 May 12

        Aring ingress  1827
               egress   1930
        Bring ingress  1951
               egress   2142
        Cring egress   2300
        Saturn ingress  2359
               egress   1002
        Bring ingress  1028
               egress   1219
        Aring ingress  1240
               egress   1343

     1993 July 2021

        Saturn ingress  2116
               egress   0508
        Aring ingress  0513  grazing
               egress   0938

Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus
orbit  Because the Suns size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is 3100 km its unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations  See Soma 1992 Astronomy
and Astrophysics 265 L21L24 for more details  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS

Jay Goguen jdgscn5JplNasaGov writes

  To me the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia
  etc  Unfortunately the 2130 UT of this event renders it inaccessible
  except from Russia  Even from Calar Alto Saturn is rising through 3
  airmasses at 2300 UT  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation thats looking for something
  to do  Id be willing to make a personal grant of 100 for the data

  Jay

and again

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths  My impression would
  be that its not an easy observation  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse so youll need a big telescope thats a
  good IR telescope and reasonable 10  20 um instrumentation  I dont
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation  We need SOFIA for this one  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India but its only a 12 m
