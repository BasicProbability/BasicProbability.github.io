Subject Space Colony Size Preferences Summary


Some time ago I sent the following message
   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony  Im gearing up to
   do another one  Id some info from you If you were to move
   onto a space colony to live permanently how big would the colony have
   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable  Specifically

   How many people do you want to share the colony with
 

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  


   Assume 1g living the colony will rotate  Assume that you can leave
   from time to time for vacations and business trips  If youre young
   enough assume that youll raise your children there

I didnt get a lot of responses and they were all over the block
Thanx muchly to all those who responded it is good food for thought




Heres the edited responses I got


   How many people do you want to share the colony with
 
100

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  

Cylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long

   How many people do you want to share the colony with

100000  250000

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  

100 square kms surface divided into city towns villages and
countryside  Must have lakes rivers amd mountains



 How many
1000  1000 people really isnt that large a number
everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year and will probably
be sick of everyone else within another year

What physical dimensions does the living are need to have  

Hm  I am not all that great at figuring it out  But I would maximize the
percentage of colonyspace that is accessible to humans  Esecially if there
were to be children since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways
And everyone especially me likes to go exploringI would want to be able
to go for a walk and see something different each time



For population I think I would want a substantial town  big enough
to have strangers in it  This helps get away from the smalltown
everybody knows everything syndrome which some people like but
I dont  Call it several thousand people

For physical dimensions a somewhat similar criterion  big enough
to contain surprises at least until you spent considerable time
getting to know it  As a more specific rule of thumb big enough
for there to be places at least an hour away on foot  Call that
5km which means a 10km circumference if were talking a sphere

My desires for permanent move to a space colony assuming easy communication
and travel

Size  About a smalltown size say 9 sq km  Course bigger is better 
Population  about 100sq km or less  So 1000 for 9sqkm  Less is
better for elbow room more for interest and sanity so say max 3000 min 300
