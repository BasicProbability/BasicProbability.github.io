Subject Re Inflatable MileLong Space Billboards was Re Vandalizing the sky

In article YAMAUCHI93Apr21131325yuggothcescwruedu yamauchicescwruedu Brian Yamauchi writes
 NASA would provide contractual launch services However
 since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
 WN 26 Mar 93 the taxpayers would bear most of the expense This
 may look like environmental vandalism but Mike Lawson CEO of
 Space Marketing told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
 project is to help the environment The platform will carry ozone
 monitors he explainedadvertising is just to help defray costs
 
 This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people  My
 guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
 build large inflatable space structures
 

The CU people have been and continue to be big ozone scientists So 
this is consistent It is also consistent with the new Comercial 
applications that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard 
 
 Is NASA really supporting this junk

Did anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert 
all over it I think the rocket people got alot of  for painting 
up the sides with the movie stuff What about the CokePepsi thing 
a few years back NASA has been trying to find ways to get other 
people into the space funding business for some time Frankly Ive 
thought about trying it too When the funding gets tight only the 
innovative get funded One of the things NASA is big on is cofunding 
If a PI can show cofunding for any proposal that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY
higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no 
cofunding Once again money talks
