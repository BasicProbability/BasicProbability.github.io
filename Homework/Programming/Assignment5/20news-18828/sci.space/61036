Apollo was done the hard way in a big hurry from a very limited
technology base and on government contracts  Just doing it privately
rather than as a government project cuts costs by a factor of several
 
 So how much would it cost as a private venture assuming you could talk the
 US government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida 
 
 
 
     Software engineering Thats like military intelligence isnt it

Why must it be a US Government Space Launch Pad Directly I mean
I know of a few that could launch a small package into space
Not including Ariadne and the Russian Sites I know Poker Flats here in
Alaska thou used to be only sounding rockets for Auroral Borealoussp and
other northern atmospheric items is at last I heard being upgraded to be able
to put sattelites into orbit 

Why must people in the US be fixed on using NASAs direct resources Poker Flats
is runin part by NASA but also by the Univesity of Alaska and the Geophysical
Institute Sounds like typical US cultural centralism and protectionism
And people wonder why we have the multitrillion dollar deficitesp
Yes I am working on a spell checker
