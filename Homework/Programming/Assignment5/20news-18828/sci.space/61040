     What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble  For
providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the US
Space Foundation  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket
Technology rocket or SSRT  By I intend to speak of more  How to
lower the cost and make rapid progress  SSRT is to my mind 
and I hope to convince you  the erupting a new rallying cry for
our generation in space  Faster Cheaper and Better

     Faster Cheaper Better and SSRT represent the passing of a
torch from one technical generation to another  It is a new
thing to be sure  but it is also a relearning of old things
from past masters

     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago so called
experts told us it violates the laws of physics  it made no
sense  For example Dr Eberhart Rachtin  former president of
the Aerospace Corp said of SSRT in the LA Times that it
defies the best principles of launching payloads into space 
Well Dr Rachtin  youve made us mad  What are these
principles that SSRT defies

     Well Ill tell you  It violates the principle that you need
a giant program office to build space hardware  It violates the
fact that it takes 20 years to build something new  And it
violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for
less than many billions of dollars

     It took some of the last generations experts to teach us
some newold lessons  Werhner Von Brauns first rocket was not a
Saturn V  General Schrievers ICBMs didnt take ten years to
demonstrate  And the X1 airplane didnt cost 1 billion

     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950s to remind
us of these truths  Max Hunter  Max to remind you was a
senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program and old faster better
cheaper success story  Max has been persistent in a vision of a
single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960s 
Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps  Build a
little Test a little

     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration  We
didnt solicit a bunch of requirements  theyd just change
every few years anyway   not included in the speech  The
ALSNLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better
known as Shape Shifter than Space Lifter  We didnt spend a
lot money  this XRocket only cost 60 million  Whens the
last time we even built a new airplane for that  And it didnt
take a lot of time to build  McDonnell Douglas completed it in
18 months  Finally the government program office consisted of
one very overworked Air Force Major  motivated in part by the
threat that hed get to ride on it in a strappedon lawn chair if
it ran over cost or schedule

     As I described what SSRT is  and isnt keep in mind its
only a first step  There are several more steps  and steps
that can easily fail  before the US can field an SSTO  But
each step should follow the same principles  a small management
team  a few years technology demonstration  and a modest
budget

     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve
See charts

     Im embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation  the giants of the last great space era the 1950s
and 1960s  They went to the moon  we built a telescope that
cant see straight  They softlanded on Mars  the least we
could do is softland on Earth

     But we do have an answer  We can follow their build a
little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable
and routine access to space  I know there are nay sayers among
you  those who say SSRT is a stunt  It needs more thermal
protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land
horizontally etc etc

     I say to you  well see you at White Sands in June  You
bring your viewgraphs and Ill bring my rocketship  If we do
what we say we can do then you let us do the next step   not
included in the speech  If we fail  you still have your
program offices staff summary sheets requirement analyses and
decade long programs

     I bet on my generation and Max Hunters idea  Any Takers
