Unfortunately H Beam Piper killed him self just weeks short of having his
first book published and have his ideas see light Such a waste


Piper lived in my town Williamsport PA when he killed himself  It
was in the early 60s  He had had more than a few books published by
that time but he was down on his luck financially  Rumor was that he
was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food  He viewed himself as
a resourceful man and IMO decided to check out gracefully if he
couldnt support himself  The worst part is that John Campbell the
longtime editor of AstoundingAnalog SF magazine had cut a check for
Pipers most recent story and said check was in the mail  If Campbell
had known Pipers straits Im sure he would have phoned to say hang on
Campbell was like that

I wish it had happened differently  I always enjoyed Pipers stuff
