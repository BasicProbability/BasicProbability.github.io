   Also perijoves of Gehrels3 were

  Where 1 Jupiter radius  71000 km  44000 mi  00005 AU 

 Sorry perijovesIm not used to talking this language

Thanks again  One final question  The name Gehrels wasnt known to
me before this thread came up but the May issue of Scientific American
has an article about the Inconstant Cosmos with a photo of Neil
Gehrels project scientist for NASAs Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
Same person

Neil Gehrels is Prof Tom Gehrels son  Tom Gehrels was the discoverer
of PGehrels 3 as well as about 4 other comets  the latest of which
does not bear his name but rather the name Spacewatch since he was
observing with that system when he found the latest comet
