Subject Re Surviving Large Accelerations

 heres my question finally  Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable  with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course If these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration

This sounds a bit high to me  Still higher accelerations have been endured
very briefly during violent deceleration  If were talking sustained
acceleration I think 30odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion

I doubt that any of this generalizes to another order of magnitude
