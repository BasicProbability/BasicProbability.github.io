Subject Why DC1 will be the way of the future



I once read an article on  Computer technology  which stated that 
every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it
replaced  Silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products
then available   GaAs  was less capable then Silicon  Multiprocessors
were slower then  existent single processors

What the argument was though was that these new technologies promised either
theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities

I think that the DC1  may gfit into this same model

ELVs can certainly launch more weight  then  a SSRT  but 
an SSRT offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs

This is kind of a speculative posting  but I thought id throw it out as
a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project
