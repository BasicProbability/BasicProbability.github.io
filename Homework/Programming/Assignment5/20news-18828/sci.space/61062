			The Deputy for Technology SDIO

	Most of you as am I are children of the 1960s  We grew
up in an age of miracles  InterContinental Ballistic Missiles
nuclear energy computers flights to the moon  But these were
miracles of our parents doing 

                          Speech by Pete Worden
          Delivered Before the US Space Foundation Conference

     Im embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation  the giants of the last great space era the 1950s
and 1960s  They went to the moon  we built a telescope that
cant see straight  They softlanded on Mars  the least we
could do is softland on Earth

Just out of curiousity how old is Worden
