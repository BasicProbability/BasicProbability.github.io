Subject Re Why DC1 will be the way of the future

	Hmmm I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record
players and radios in the 1960s wasnt better performance but lower
perunit cost than vacuumtube systems

	Mind you my father was a vacuumtube fan in the 60s Switched
to solidstate in the midseventies and then abruptly died no doubt
theres a lesson in that and his account could have been biased
