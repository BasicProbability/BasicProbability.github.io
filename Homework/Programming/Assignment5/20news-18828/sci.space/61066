   As for advertising  sure why not  A NASA friend and I spent one
   drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar wed need
   to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization
   on the face of the Moon  Fortunately we sobered up in the morning

Hmmm It actually isnt all that much is it Like about 2 million
km2 if you think that sounds like a lot its only a few tens of m2
per burger that said organization sold last year Youd be best off
with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an
unmanned craft in lunar orbit or rather a large set of such craft
If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new
moon since the moon itself is quite dark and bright at full moon
You might have to abandon the colour though

Buy a cheap launch system design reusable moon  lunar orbit
unmanned spraying craft build 50 said craft establish a lunar base
to extract TiO2 say for colour youd be better off with a sulphur
compound I suppose and some sort of propellant and Bobs your
uncle  Ill do it for say 20 billion dollars plus changes of
identity for me and all my loved ones Delivery date 2010

Can we get the fastfood chain bidding against the fizzydrink
vendors Who else might be interested

Would they buy it given that its a lot more expensive and not
much more impressive than putting a large set of severalkm
inflatable billboards in LEO or in GEO visible 24 hours from your
key growth market Ill do that for only 5bn and the changes of
identity
