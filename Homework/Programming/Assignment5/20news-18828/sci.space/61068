From 18084TMmsuedu Tom
Subject Golden  Space ages

Pat sez
Oddly enough  The smithsonian calls the lindbergh years
the golden age of flight  I would call it the granite years
reflecting the primitive nature of it  It was  romantic
swashbuckling daredevils  those daring young men in their flying
machines  But in reality it sucked  Death was a highly likely
occurence  and  the environment blew

Yeah but a windscreen cut down most of it  Canopies ended it completely

Of course the environment in space continues to suck
