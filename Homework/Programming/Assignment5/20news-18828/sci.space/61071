I thought that under emergency conditions  the STS  can
put down at any good size Airport  IF it could take a C5 or a
747 then it can take an orbiter   You just need a VORTAC

I dont know if they need ILS

DFW was designed with the STS in mind which really mean very little  Much of
their early PR material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three
others pulled up to gates  I guess they were trying to stress how advanced the
airport was

For Dallas types  Imagine the fit Grapevine and Irving would be having if the
shuttle WAS landing at DFW For the rest they are currently having some power
struggles between the airport and surrounding cities
