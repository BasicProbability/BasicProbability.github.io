Apollo was done the hard way in a big hurry from a very limited
technology base and on government contracts  Just doing it privately
rather than as a government project cuts costs by a factor of several

So how much would it cost as a private venture assuming you could talk the
US government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida 

Why use a ground launch pad It is entirely posible to launch from altitude
This was what the Shuttle was originally intended to do It might be seriously
cheaper 

Also what about bioengineered CO2 absorbing plants instead of many LOX bottles
Stick em in a lunar cave and put an airlock on the door
