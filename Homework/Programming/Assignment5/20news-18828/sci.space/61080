So how much would it cost as a private venture assuming you could talk the
US government into leasing you a couple of pads in Florida 

Why would you want to do that The goal is to do it cheaper remember
this isnt government Instead of leasing an expensive launch pad
just use a SSTO and launch from a much cheaper facility

making statement without thinking them out 

Wanna guess which today

Youd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff  Do you know
