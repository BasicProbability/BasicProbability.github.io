Would they buy it given that its a lot more expensive and not
much more impressive than putting a large set of severalkm
inflatable billboards in LEO or in GEO visible 24 hours from your
key growth market Ill do that for only 5bn and the changes of
identity

	Ive heard of sillier things like a wellknown utility company
wanting to buy an automated boilercleaning system which uses as many
operators as the old system and which rumour has it costs three million
more per unit Automation is more efficient although by what scale they are
not saying
