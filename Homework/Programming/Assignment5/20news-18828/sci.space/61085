I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth
you need a deltav of 25 kms  
Unfortunately if you launch this from the US or are a US citizen
you will need a launch permit from the Office of Commercial Space
Transportation and I think it may be difficult to get a permit for
an antisatellite weapon 

Well Henry we are often reminded how CANADA is not a part of the United States
yet  You could have quite a commercial ASAT er skycleaning service going
in a few years
