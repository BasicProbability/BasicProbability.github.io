SPACECRAFT

1  On April 19 cruise science Memory Readouts MROs were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer
MAG instruments  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly

2  On April 19 a Command Detector Unit SignaltoNoise Ratio CDUSNR test
and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control RFSAGC test were
performed using the LGA1 Low Gain Antenna 1 over DSS63 Madrid 70 meter
antenna and DSS61 Madrid 34 meter antenna respectively  Data analysis
is in process  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity

3  On April 19 a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours its planned value during this mission phase

4  On April 21 the first of two suppressed carrierDSN Deep Space Network
advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS14 Goldstone
70 meter antenna  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees
to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings

5  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
greater than 25 DN throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance
measurement has  The AC measurement reads 20 DN 45 volts  The DC
measurement has ranged from 43 DN 46 volts to 138 DN 162 volts and
currently reads 138 DN 162 volts  These measurements are consistent with
the model developed by the ACDC special anomaly team

6  The Spacecraft status as of April 22 1993 is as follows

       a  System Power Margin   68 watts
       b  Spin Configuration  DualSpin
       c  Spin RateSensor  315rpmStar Scanner
       d  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees

TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday April 22 1993 the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows

	Distance from Earth         169747800 km 114 AU
	Distance from Sun           286967900 km 192 AU
	Heliocentric Speed          91200 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       532735900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes 58 seconds


SPECIAL TOPIC

1  As of April 22 1993 a total of 70185 realtime commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch  Of these 65077  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the realtime command process
In the past week one real time command was transmitted one was initiated in
the sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command
process The only command activity was a command to reset the command loss
timer
