of a private Titan pad 

Youd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff if you assume
no new launcher development  If you assume new launcher development with
lower costs as a specific objective then you probably dont want to
build something HLVsized anyway

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans  It
doesnt take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster all of which
would have far better costeffectiveness
