Ah theres the rub  And a catch22 to boot  For the purposes of a
contest youll probably not compete ifn you cant afford the ride to get
there  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable without
demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system

Youre assuming that the lowcost delivery system has to be a separate
project  But why  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
in hopes of winning a billiondollar prize it is cheaper to develop
your own launch system charging its entire development cost against
your contest entry than to try to do it with existing launchers  No
other demand is necessary

 Any plan for doing
 sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
 money in a big way

This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line  In other
words perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support
navigation etc could be developed prior to a low cost launch system 
You wouldnt want to use the expensive stuff forever but Id hate to see
folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac oops I mean launch
system comes on line

Youre assuming that its going to take a decade to build a new launch
system  But why  The Saturn V took less than six years depending on
exactly when you date its start  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development
the target date for an orbital DCY flight was 1996  If you really want
speed consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile still in
service as the core of the Delta launcher shipped to the USAF less
than 18 months after the development goahead

One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief
that you cant build a launcher without taking ten years and spending
billions of dollars  It isnt true and never was
