Doug Actually if memory serves the Atlas is an outgrowth of the old 
Titan ICBM

Nope youre confusing separate programs  Atlas was the firstgeneration
US ICBM Titan I was the secondgeneration one Titan II which all the
Titan launchers are based on was the thirdgeneration heavy ICBM  There
was essentially nothing in common between these three programs

Yes three programs  Despite the similarity of names Titan I and
Titan II were completely different missiles  They didnt even use the
same fuels never mind the same launch facilities

If so theres probably quite a few old pads albeit in need 
of some serious reconditioning  Still Being able to buy the turf and 
pad and bunkers including prep facility at Midwest farmland prices 
strikes me as pretty damned cheap

Sorry the Titan silos a cant handle the Titan launchers with their
large SRBs b cant handle any sort of launcher without massive
violations of normal rangesafety rules nobody cares about such things
in the event of a nuclear war but in peacetime they matter and c were
scrapped years ago
