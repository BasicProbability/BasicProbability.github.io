   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such
   Why not

Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know exactly where
it is which means you either nail it to something that doesnt move
or you watch it all the time  Neither of which is possible on a
deactivated spacecraft  Then you have to know exactly how far away
from it you are this may or may not be possible with the hardware on
board 

Apart from which there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons
