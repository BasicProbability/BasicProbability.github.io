The better question  should be
Why not transfer  OM of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding
to support these kind of ongoing science missions

Since we dont have the money to keep them going now how will
changing them to a seperate agency help anything

How about transferring control to a nonprofit organisation that is
able to accept donations to keep craft operational
