Seems that the MileLong Billboard and any other inflateble space
objectstation or what ever have the same problems other than being a little
bit different than the normal space ideas such as trusses and shuttles

But also dag and such Why not combine the discussion of how and fesibility to
the same topic

I personnelly liek the idea of a billboard in space But problem How do you
service it fly a shuttleDC1 to near it and then dismount and fly to it
Or what or havign a special docking section for shuttleDC1 docking

Also what if the billboard springs a leak Self sealing and such


Just thinking okay rambling

Also why must the now inflated billboard not be covered in the inside by a
harder substance such as a polymer or other agent and then the now hard
billboard would be a now giant docking structurespace dockstation

Or am I missing something here probably am
