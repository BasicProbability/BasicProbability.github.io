Subject Re Vandalizing the sky

I posted this over in sciastro but it didnt make it here
Thought you all would like my wonderful pithy commentary 

What You guys have never seen the Goodyear blimp polluting
the daytime and nightime skies

Actually an oribital sign would only be visible near
sunset and sunrise I believe  So pollution at night
would be minimal

If it pays for space travel go for it  Those who dont
like spatial billboards can then head for the pristine
environment of Jupiters moons
