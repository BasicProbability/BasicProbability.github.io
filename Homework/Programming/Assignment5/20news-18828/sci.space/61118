   Somebody pointed out quite correctly that such rights are
 not anybodys to grant although I imagine it would be a fait accompli
 situation for the winner  So how about this  Give the winning group
 I cant see one company or corp doing it a 10 20 or 50 year
 moratorium on taxes
 
 Tom Freebairn 


Who says there is no mineral rights to be given Who says The UN or the US
Government 

Toms right about this  Its only a grantable right if the granter has
the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you
Never mind the legal status

Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars who will stop you
The UN cant other than legal tom foolerie Can the truly inforce it

Nicks right about this  Its always easier to obtain forgiveness than
permission  Not many people remember that Britains King George III
expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghanyappalachian
mountains  Said subjects basically said Stop us if you can  He
couldnt

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation who will
stop you from doing it Maybe not acknowledge you 

Thats how the USA started  Of course thats also how the Bolivarian
Republic started ca 18001820 in central america  It didnt have
quite the staying power of the USA  Im sure there are more examples of
going far away and then ignoring authority but none jump to mind right
now

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroidsmarsmoon or what
ever As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble

Or do as some whaling nations do define whatever activities you want to
carry out as scientific research which just coincidentally requires
the recovery of megatonnes of minerals or whatever then go at it

Basically find a country who wants to go into space but cant for soem reason
or another but who will give you a home Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever

Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya I think in
the late 70s for his commercial space launch project one of the very
earliest  It was killed by Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise
missiles in Africa which made Libya renege on the arrangement
