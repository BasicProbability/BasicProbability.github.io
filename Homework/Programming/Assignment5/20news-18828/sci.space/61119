Subject Re Death and Taxes was Why not give 1 billion to

In my last post I referred to Michael Adams as Nick  Completely my
error Nick Adams was a film and TV actor from the 50s and early 60s
remember Johnny Yuma The Rebel  He was from my part of the country
and Michaels email address of nmsca probably helped confuse things
in my mind  Purely user headspace error on my part  Sorry
