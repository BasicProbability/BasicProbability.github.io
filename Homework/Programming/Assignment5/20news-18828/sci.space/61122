Subject Re Clementine mission name

 Old pioneer song from the 1850s or so goes as follows

   In a cavern in a canyon
    Excavating for a mine
    Dwelt a miner fortyniner
    And his daughter CLEMENTINE

 Chorus
   Oh my darling Oh my darling
    Oh my darling Clementine
    You are lost and gone forever
    Oh my darling Clementine


        Let us hope that the performance of the spacecraft follows the
sentiments of the first verse miner rather than the second lost and gone
forever
