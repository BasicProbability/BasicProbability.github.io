 Sorry if I do not have the big degrees
and such but I think I might be wrong to error is human I have something
that is in many ways just as important I have imagination dreams And without
dreams all the knowledge is worthless 
 
 Oh and us with the big degrees dont got imagination huh
 
 The alleged dichotomy between imagination and knowledge is one of the most
 pernicious fallacys of the New Age  Michael thanks for the generous
 offer but we have quite enough dreams of our own thank you

Well said
 
 You on the other hand are letting your own dreams go to waste by
 failing to get the mathsthermodynamicschemistryyour choices here
 which would give your imagination wings
 
 Just to show this isnt a flame I leave you with a quote from Invasion of 
 the Body Snatchers
 
 Become one of us its not so bad you know

Okay Del so Michael was being unfair but you are being unfair back  
He is taking college courses now I presume he is studying hard and
his postings reveal that he is somewhat hip to the technical issues
of astronautics  Plus he is attentively following the erudite
discourse of the Big Brains who post to scispace is it not
inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from
reading the likes of you and me 1

Like others involved in scispace Mr Adams shows symptoms of being a
fledgling member of the technoculture and I think hes soaking it up
fast  I was a young guy with dreams once and they led me to get a
technical education to follow them up  Too bad I wound up in an
assemblyline job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day

McCall
