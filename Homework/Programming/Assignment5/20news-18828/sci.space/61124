 3  On April 19 a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase
 
This activity is regularly reported in Rons interesting posts Could
someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is
 

The Command Loss Timer is part of the fault protection scheme of the
spacecraft  If the Command Loss Timer ever countdowns to zero then the
spacecraft assumes it has lost communications with Earth and will go 
through a set of predetermined steps to try to regain contact  The
Command Loss Timer is set to 264 hours and reset about once a week during 
the cruise phase and is set to a lower value during an encounter phase
