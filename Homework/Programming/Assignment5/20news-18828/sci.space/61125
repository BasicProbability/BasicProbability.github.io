Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
exploration

Basically get the ecofreaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth

They arent going to leave a loophole as glaring as space mining  Quite a
few of those people are when you come right down to it basically against
industrial civilization  They wont stop with shutting down the mines here
that is only a means to an end for them now

The worst thing you can say to a true revolutionary is that his revolution
is unnecessary that the problems can be corrected without radical change
Telling people that paradise can be attained without the revolution is
treason of the vilest kind

Trying to harness these people to support spaceflight is like trying to
harness a buffalo to pull your plough  Hes got plenty of muscle all
right but the furrow will go where he wants not where you want
