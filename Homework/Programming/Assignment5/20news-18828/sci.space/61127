  a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer 

This activity is regularly reported in Rons interesting posts Could
someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is

If Im not mistaken this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of
communications  That timer is counting down continuously if it ever hits
zero that means Galileo hasnt heard from Earth in a suspiciously long
time and it may be Galileos fault so its time to go into a fallback
mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances
of restoring contact  I dont know exactly whatall Galileo does in such
a situation but a common example is to switch receivers on the theory
that maybe the one youre listening with has died
