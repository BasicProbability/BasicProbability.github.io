INteresting question about Galileo

Galileos HGA  is stuck   

The HGA was left closed  because galileo  had a venus flyby

If the HGA were pointed att he sun  near venus  it would
cook the foci elements

question  WHy couldnt Galileos  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point

After all  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway

or would it be that an emergency situation ie spacecraft safing
and seek might have caused an HGA sun point
