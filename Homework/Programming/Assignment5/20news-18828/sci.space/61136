	Hmmm I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record
players and radios in the 1960s wasnt better performance but lower
perunit cost than vacuumtube systems



I dont think so at first  but solid state offered  better reliabity
id bet  and any lower costs would be only after the processes really scaled up

Careful  Making statements about how solid state is generally more
reliable than analog will get you a nasty followup from Tommy Mac or
