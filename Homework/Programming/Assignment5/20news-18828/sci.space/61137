 3  On April 19 a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase

This activity is regularly reported in Rons interesting posts Could
someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says
it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving
commands  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer I believe the
probe starts a search for Earth sequence involving antenna pointing
and attitude changes which consume fuel to try to reestablish
communications  Noops are sent periodically through those periods
when there are no real commands to be sent just so the probe knows
that we havent forgotten about it

Hope thats clear enough to be comprehensible
