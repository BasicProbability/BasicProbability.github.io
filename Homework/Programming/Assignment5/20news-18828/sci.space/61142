Hello I am looking for a program or algorithm that can be used
to compute sunrise and sunset times

I would appreciate any advice

I once thought it would be easiest fitting a sine to the times But not
This gave  discrepancy of upto six minutes If you fit a sine series
youll get a very good fit after just three or four terms though This
presumably has to do with the eccentricity of the Earths orbit
