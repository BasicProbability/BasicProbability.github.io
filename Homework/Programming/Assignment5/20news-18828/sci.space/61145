Subject Re Sunrise sunset times


There is a nice little tool in Lucid emacs Its called calendar
On request it shows for given longitudelatitude coordinates times for
sunset and sunrise The code is written in lisp
I dont know if you like the idea that an editor is the right program to
calculate these things
