 3 The Onboard Flight Software project was rated Level 5 by a NASA team
    This group generates 2040 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA

Will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term Level 5 comes
from It sounds like the RISKS Digest  equivalent of Large Extra
Large Jumbo Or maybe its like Defcon 5

I gather it means that Shuttle software was developed with extreme
care to have reliablility and safety and almost everything else in
the computing world is Level 1 or cheesy dimestore software  Not
surprising  But who is it that invents this standard and how come
everyone but me seems to be familiar with it
