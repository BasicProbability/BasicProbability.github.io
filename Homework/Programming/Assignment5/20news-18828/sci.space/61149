Subject Space Station Redesign JSC Alternative 4

I have 19 2 MB worth uuencoded GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City  Mr Mark Holderman works down the hall from me and can
be reached for comment at 713 4831317 or via email at
mholdermjscprofsnasagov

Mark proposed this design which he calls Geode rough on the
outside but a gem on the inside or the ET Strongback with
integrated hab modules and centrifuge  As you can see from file
geodeAgif it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank ET in place of much
of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom  The
white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte
Manipulator System SRMS and by the Reaction Control System RCS
pod  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting
can occur near the center of gravity CG of the Station as the mass
properties of the Station change during assembly

The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because
it can approach closer to the Stations CG and at a structurally strong
part of the Station  In the current SSF design docking forces are
limited to 400 pounds which seriously constrains the design of the
docking system

The ET would have a hatch installed preflight with little additional
launch mass  Weve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit
contrary to some rumors which have circulated here but weve never
had a reason to do it while we have had some good reasons not to
performance penalties control debris generation and eventual
deorbit and impact footprint  Once onorbit we would vent the
residual H2  The ET insulation SOFI either a erodes onorbit from
impact with atomic Oxygen or b stays where it is and we deploy a
Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating
the local space environment  Option b has the advantage of providing
further micrometeor protection  The ET is incredibly strong remember
it supports the whole stack during launch and could serve as the
nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits

The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment
Gyros to be used for attitude control while the RCS will be used
for gyro desaturation  The module also contains a deorbit system
which can be used at the end of the Stations life to perform a
controlled deorbit so we dont kill any more kangaroos like we
did with Skylab

The centrifuge which has the same volume as a hab module could be
used for longterm studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity
on humans  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device
for the whole attitude control system  The centrifuge is mounted on
one of the modules opposite the ET and the solar panels

This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical
data and communication systems getting leverage from the SSF work
done to date

Mark proposed this design at Joe Sheas committee in Crystal City
and he reports that he was warmly received  However the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely

Please note that this text is my interpretation of Marks design
you should see his notes in the GIF files  

Instead of posting a 2 MB file to scispace I tried to post these for
anonFTP in amesarcnasagov but it was out of storage space  Ill
let you all know when I get that done
