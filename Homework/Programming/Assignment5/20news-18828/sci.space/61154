 Plutos atmosphere will start to freeze out around 2010 and after about
 2005 increasing areas of both Pluto and Charon will be in permanent
 shadow that will make imaging and geochemical mapping impossible

Its my understanding that the freezing will start to occur because of the
growing distance of Pluto and Charon from the Sun due to its
elliptical orbit It is not due to shadowing effects 

Where does the shadow come from  Theres nothing close enough to block
sunlight from hitting them  I wouldnt expect there to be anything block
our view of them either  What am I missing

Pluto can shadow Charon and viceversa
