                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April 23 1993
                              1000 AM PDT

Flight Sequence C8 is active the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna uplink
at 125 bps downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9 all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by onboard fault
protection software  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday April 19  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at 1030 AM

Over this weekend the Flight Team will send realtime commands to
perform Differential OneWay Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday 

The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday April 25 with
activation at Midnight Monday evening April 26  C9 has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due
to Contingency Mode entry on April 9  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraftgenerated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points
in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations

Today the spacecraft is 22971250 km 14273673 mi from Mars
travelling at a velocity of 209 kilometerssecond 4677 mph with
respect to Mars  Oneway light time is approximately 10 minutes 38
seconds
