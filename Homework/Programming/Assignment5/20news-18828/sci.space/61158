   	If the  new  Kuiper belt object is  called Karla the next
   one  should be called Smiley

   Unless Im imaging things always a possibility  1992 QB1 the Kuiper Belt
   object discovered last year is known as Smiley

As it happens the second one is Karla The first one was
Smiley All subject to the vagaries of the IAU of course
but I think they might let this one slide

	Gee I feel so ignorant now

	Research then post
