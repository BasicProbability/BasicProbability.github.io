Subject Re Space Station Redesign Chief Resigns for Health Reasons

In article C5xuGLJowskatesgsfcnasagov xrcjdmudpuppygsfcnasagov Charles J Divine writes
Writer Kathy Sawyer reported in todays Washington Post that Joseph Shea the 
head of the space station redesign has resigned for health reasons
 
Shea was hospitalized shortly after his selection in February  He returned
yesterday to lead the formal presentation to the independent White House panel
Sheas presentation was rambling and almost inaudible

I missed the presentations given in the morning session when Shea gave
his rambling and almost inaudible presentation but I did attend
the afternoon session The meeting was in a small conference room The
speaker was wired with a mike and there were microphones on the table for
the panel members to use Peons like me sat in a foyer outside the
conference room and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV In
general the sound system was fair to poor and some of the other
speakers like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency
also were almost inaudible

Shea didnt lead the formal presentation in the sense of running
or guiding the presentation He didnt even attend the afternoon
session Vest ran the show President of MIT the chair of the
advisory panel

 
Sheas deputy former astronaut Bryan OConnor will take over the effort

Note that OConnor has been running the daytoday
operations of the of the redesign team since Shea got sick which
was immediately after the panel was formed
