 Plutos atmosphere will start to freeze out around 2010 and after about
 2005 increasing areas of both Pluto and Charon will be in permanent
 shadow that will make imaging and geochemical mapping impossible

Where does the shadow come from  Theres nothing close enough to block
sunlight from hitting them  I wouldnt expect there to be anything block
our view of them either  What am I missing

Youre assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight  Not so  Even on Earth each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in midwinter  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit  Plutos north pole for example gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light

At the moment were in luck  Pluto and Charon are just past their
equinox when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles of each
If we get probes there soon only the immediate vicinity of one pole
on each will be in longterm shadow  This will get steadily worse the
longer we wait
