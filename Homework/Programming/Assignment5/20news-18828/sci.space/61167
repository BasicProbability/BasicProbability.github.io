 All in all Im not certain that the single goalprize of staying on the
 moon for a year is wise andor useful  How about  A prize for the
 first
 nongovernment sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a
 manned
 moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
 lunar soil another for a reusable earthmoon shuttle and so forth 
 Find
 some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure  Having a single
 goal
 might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person
 appeared
 to win  And for those that didnt give up I find something a little
 scary
 about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters  Id
 like to see as much a reward for cooperation as for competition

 Lastly about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was
 an
 English space magazine that had an ongoing discussion about moonbases
 on
 the cheap  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
 body produced how much lunar material itd need for protection from
 solar
 flares etc  Unfortunately I dont remember the name of this magazine 
 Does this ring a bell to anyone

I love the idea of progressive developmental prizes but the assumption
has
been all along that only the US Gummint could fund the prizes  It
wouldnt and couldnt do such a thing  BUT 

An eccentric billionaire COULD offer such a prize or series of prizes

Anyone know H Ross Perot or Bill Gates personally
