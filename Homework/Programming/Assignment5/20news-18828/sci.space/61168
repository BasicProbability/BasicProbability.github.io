 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE IS GRAVITY

  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary 
ether sucking structures AND why we observe orbital motion
  

  LightYears between galaxies is a misnomer The distance is 
closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase 
of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion 
defining edge  0 ether spin  

  To find out about all of this I recommend studying history  

Well Im working on it but getting a little impatient So far 
Ive made it through Egyptian Chinese and Greek cultures and
up through the Rennaisance But so far these insights just dont 
seem to be gelling Perhaps its in an appendix somewhere

In its own right though the history is kind of fun Lots of 
good yarns in there with varied and interesting characters And
more to come
