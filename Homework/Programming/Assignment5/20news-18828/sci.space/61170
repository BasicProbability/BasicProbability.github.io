Like others involved in scispace Mr Adams shows symptoms of being a
fledgling member of the technoculture and I think hes soaking it up
fast  I was a young guy with dreams once and they led me to get a
technical education to follow them up  Too bad I wound up in an
assemblyline job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day


How can you tell theyre identical

You got one of them Star Drek The Next Syndication neutrino
scanners

Phil Fraering         Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff
