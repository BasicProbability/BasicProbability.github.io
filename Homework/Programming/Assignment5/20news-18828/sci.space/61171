Subject DCXY1 question
From kkobayashusc8harvardedu Ken Kobayashi



   Ive been following discussions about the Delta Clipper program and I
have one small question  As I understand it the DCX derived orbital
vehicle DCY  1 is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways not
completely nosefirst  So why is the DCY look symmetric in every drawing
Ive seen  I would think that an asymmetric design sort of like 
wingless Orbiter may work better since less shielding is required on the
top side  Can anybody explain
