     I saw in the newspaper last night that Dr Mae Jemison the first
  black woman in space shes a physician and chemical engineer who flew
  on Endeavour last year will appear as a transporter operator on the
  Star Trek The Next Generation episode that airs the week of May 31
  Its hardly space science I know but its interesting

 Interesting is rigth I wonder if they will make a mention of her being an
 astronaut in the credits I think it might help people connect the future  
of
 space with the present And give them an idea that we must go into space
 


A transporter operator  That better be one important transport  Usually  
it is a nameless ensign who does the job  For such a guest appearance I would  
have expected a more visiblemeaningful role
