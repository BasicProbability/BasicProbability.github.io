Galileos HGA  is stuck   

The HGA was left closed  because galileo  had a venus flyby

If the HGA were pointed att he sun  near venus  it would
cook the foci elements

question  WHy couldnt Galileos  course manuevers have been
designed such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point

The HGA isnt all that reflective in the wavelengths that might cook the
focal elements nor is its figure good on those scalesthe problem is
that the antenna itself could not be exposed to Venuslevel sunlight
lest like Icarus wings it melt  I think it was glues and such as well
as electronics that they were worried about  Thus it had to remain
furled and the axis always pointed near the sun so that the small
sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA
A larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus
