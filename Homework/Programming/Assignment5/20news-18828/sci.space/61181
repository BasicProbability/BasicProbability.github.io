     I agree  You can add dark matter and quarks and a lot of other
unobservable purely theoretical constructs in physics to that list
including the omnipresent black holes

     Will Bruce argue that their existence can be inferred from theory
alone  Then what about my original criticism when I said Curvature
can only exist relative to something noncurved  Bruce replied
Existence is undefined unless it is synonymous with observable in
physics  We cannot observe more than the four dimensions we know about
At the moment I dont see a way to defend that statement and the
existence of these unobservable phenomena simultaneously  Tom

I hold that space cannot be curved for the simple reason that it can have
no properties
Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the
space To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved
is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing I
for one refuse to subscribe to such a view  Nikola Tesla


 ET  Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time Perhaps now his time comes
