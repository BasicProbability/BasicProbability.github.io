 In answer
to a question from Hawking Chahine described a proposed
dragfree satellite but confirmed that at this point its only
a concept 

SO whats a drag free satellite   coated with WD40

	I am puzzled by the term concept Drag free may already have
been flown It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
more accurately respond to motions from the Earths gravity field and
ignore drag It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them The ball itself would
then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
anisotropies whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
adjusting its position to compensate for drag
