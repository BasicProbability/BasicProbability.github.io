 The only thing
that scares me is the part about simply strapping 3 SSMEs and
a nosecone on it and just launching it  I have this vision
of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the
complete loss of the new modular space station not just a peice of
it as would be the case with staged inorbit construction

It doesnt make a whole lot of difference actually since they werent
building spares of the station hardware anyway  Dumb  At least this
is only one launch to fail
