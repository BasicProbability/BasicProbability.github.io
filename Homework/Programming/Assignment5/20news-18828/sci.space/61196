Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters  Where are they

   What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away
 
 Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
 quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by
 
 Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   
 
 my own pet theory is that its  Flying saucers  entering
 hyperspace 
 
 but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
 are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes  i just wondered
 if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in
 
 pat  
        Well lets seeI took a class on this last fall and I have no
notes so Ill try to wing it  
        Heres how I understand it Remember from stellar evolution that 
black holes and neutron starspulsars are formed from high mass stars
Mstar14Msun  High mass stars live fast and burn hard taking
appoximately 105107 years before going nova or supernova  In this time
they dont live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any
of these if assumed to be the sources of GRBs will be in the plane of the
galaxy  
        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the
various satellites around the solar system Pioneer Venus has one either
Pion 10 or 11 GINGA and of course BATSE and we do distribution tests on our
catalog  These tests all  show that the bursts have an isotropic
distributionevenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of
homogeneity ie they do not clump in any one direction  So unless we are
sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the UNIVERSE
Not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things  Now I
suppose you are saying Well we stil only may be sampling from inside the
disk  Well not necessarily  Remember we have what is more or less an
interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out
to beyond Plutopioneer 11 so we should be able with all of our detectors de
tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite  Heres an 
analogy  You see a plane overhead  You measure the angle of the plane from
the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system  One of your friends a mile
away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his
arbitrary system which is the same as yours  The two angles are different
and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe
find a source  To my knowledge no one has been able to do this  
        I should throw in why halo and corona models dont work also  As I
said before looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts short
timescales high energy black holes and pulsars exhibit much of this type of
behavior  If this is the case as I said before these stars seem to be bound
to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these sources
When you look at a simulated model where the bursts are confined to the disk
but you sample out to large distances say 750 mpc you should definitely see
not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of sources 
in the direction of the  galactic center  As I said before there is none of
these characteristics  
        
        I think thats all of itif someone needs clarification or knows
something that I dont know by all means correct me  I had the honor of
taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these
different distributions so we pretty much kicked around every possible
distribution there was and some VERY outrageous sources Colliding pulsars
black holes pulsars that are slowing downstuff like that   Its a fun
field
