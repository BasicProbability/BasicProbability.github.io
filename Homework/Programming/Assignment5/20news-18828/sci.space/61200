How will said reboost be done
Grapple HST  stow it in Cargo bay  do OMS burn to high altitude  
unstow  HST   repair  gyros  costar install  fix solar arrays
then return to earth

Actually the reboost will probably be done last so that there is a fuel
reserve during the EVAs in case they have to chase down an adrift
astronaut or something like that  But yes youve got the idea  the
reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up

My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost
why not  grapple  do all said fixes   bolt a small  liquid  fueled
thruster module  to  HST   then let it make the reboost

Somebody has to build that thruster module its not an offtheshelf
item  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware since it has to include
attitude control HSTs own is not strong enough to compensate for things
like thruster imbalance guidance there is no provision to feed gyro
data from HSTs own gyros to an external device and separation you
dont want it left attached afterward if only to avoid possible
contamination after the telescope lid is opened again  You also get
to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is
done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle the lid stays closed for
the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from
thrusters and the like

The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the
reboost  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug well
suited to precisely this sort of job  Unfortunately it was costing
a lot to develop and the list of definitelyknown applications was
relatively short so it got cancelled
