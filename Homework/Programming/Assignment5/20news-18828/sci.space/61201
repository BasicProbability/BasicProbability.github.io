 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE IS GRAVITY

If not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words Id swear that
McElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly  I also find the
choice of newsgroups interesting  Perhaps someone should tell this
guy that sciastro doesnt stand for astrology

Its truly frightening that posts like this are originating at what
are ostensibly centers of higher learning in this country  Small
wonder that the rest of the world thinks were all nuts and that we
have the problems that we do

In case you havent gotten it yet David I dont think this was
quite appropriate for a posting to sci groups

Was that post for real I thought it was a late April Fool joke Some of it
seemed a bit over the top even by McElwaineAbianetc standards
