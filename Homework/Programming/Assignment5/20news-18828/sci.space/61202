Re Space billboards

Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon once upon
a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered
a Goodyear Blimp in orbit  The idea was to use a large structure
that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has
Placed in a low Earth orbit of high inclination it could eventually
be seen by almost everyone on Earth  Only our collective disapproval
of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
it  It had quite feasible economics which I will not post here
because I dont want to encourage the idea if you want to do such
a thing go figure it out for yourself
