Better idea for use of NASA Shuttle Astronauts and Crew is have them be found
lost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other spacetime glitch

Maybe age Jemison a few years makeup and such and have her as the only
survivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost 


Of course that asumes the mission was able to launch
