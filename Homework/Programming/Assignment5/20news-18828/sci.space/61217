Subject Order MOOREs book to restore Great Telescope

Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the
Great 72 reflector built at Birr Castle Ireland in 1845 which remained the
largest in the world until the the start of the 20th century

The Astronomy of Birr Castle was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on
the committee which is going to restore the telescope The remains are on
public display all year round  the massive support walls the 60 foot long
tube and other bits and pieces This book is the definitivie history of
how one man the Third Earl of Rosse pulled off the most impressive
technical achievement perhaps ever in the history of the telescope and
the discoveries made with the instrument

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the books sale to help restore
the telescope Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by
mail order Its a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day
when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer
