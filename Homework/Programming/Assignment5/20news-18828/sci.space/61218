In principle any star resembling the Sun mass luminosity might have planets
located in a suitable orbit There several within 100 ly of the sun They are
single stars for double or multiple systems might be troublesome Theres a
list located at amesarcnasagov somewhere in pubSPACE I think it is called
starsdat By the way what kind of project if I may know
