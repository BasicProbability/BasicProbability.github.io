 In answer
to a question from Hawking Chahine described a proposed
dragfree satellite but confirmed that at this point its only
a concept

SO whats a drag free satellite   coated with WD40


     TRIAD the first dragfree satellite was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972  The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms  The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System which consisted of a proof 
mass of special nonmagnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity  The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit free from drag and radiation 
pressure  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass thereby flying the entire satellite drag free

     TRIAD was one of the APLdesigned Navy Navigation Satellites  The 
2ndgeneration operational navigation satellites flying today NOVA use a 
singleaxis version of DISCOS  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space in 1961

     Further info on TRIAD DISCOS etc can be found in Spacecraft Design
