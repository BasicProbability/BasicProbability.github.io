 3 The Onboard Flight Software project was rated Level 5 by a NASA team
    This group generates 2040 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA

Will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term Level 5 comes
from It sounds like the RISKS Digest  equivalent of Large Extra
Large Jumbo Or maybe its like Defcon 5

I gather it means that Shuttle software was developed with extreme
care to have reliablility and safety and almost everything else in
the computing world is Level 1 or cheesy dimestore software  Not
surprising  But who is it that invents this standard and how come
everyone but me seems to be familiar with it

Level 5 refers to the CarnegieMellon Software Engineering Institutes
Capability Maturity Model  This model rates software development
orgs from15  with 1 being Chaotic and 5 being Optimizing  DoD is
beginning to use this rating system as a discriminator in contracts  I
have more data on thifrom 1 page to 1000  I have a 2030 page
presentation that summarizes it wethat I could FAX to you if youre
interested
