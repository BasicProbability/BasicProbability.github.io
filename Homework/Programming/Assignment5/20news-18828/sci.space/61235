  SOmebody mentioned  a reboost of HST during this mission  meaning
  that Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission
   

I havent heard any hint of a reboost or that any is needed

  
  why not  grapple  do all said fixes   bolt a small  liquid  fueled
  thruster module  to  HST   then let it make the reboost  it has to be
  cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug   

Nasty dirty combustion products  People have gone to monumental efforts to
keep HST clean  We certainly arent going to bolt any thrusters to it
