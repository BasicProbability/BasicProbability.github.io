Youd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff  Do you know 
of a private Titan pad 

Youd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff if you assume
no new launcher development  If you assume new launcher development with
lower costs as a specific objective then you probably dont want to
build something HLVsized anyway

Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans  It
doesnt take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster all of which
would have far better costeffectiveness

Henry I made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest
wins 

Ohhh you want to put in FINE PRINT which says Thou shall do wonderous RD
rather than use offtheshelf hardware Sorry didnt see that in my copy
Most of the Pournellesque proposals run along the lines of some dollar
amount reward for some simple goal  

You go ahead and do your development Ill buy off the shelf at higher cost or
even Russian but I also assume that thered be some Buy US provos in there
and be camped out in the Moon while you are launching and assembling little
ittybitty payloads in LEO with your laser or gas gun  And working out the
bugs of assembly  integration in LEO 

Oh hey could I get a couple of CanadARMs tuned for the lunar environment  I
wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while Im up there
