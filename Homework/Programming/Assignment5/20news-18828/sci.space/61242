Subject Re Help viewing Voyager CD ROMs on Mac

In article cnpmorrowstanfordedu MEDMGforsythestanfordedu David Gaba MD writes
Two and a half years ago I purchased a set of CD ROMs from the
University of Colorado Lab for Atmos and Space Physics  They
were Space Sciences Sampler and Voyagers to the Outer Planets

With Pixel Pusher we could never get past messages something like
This file has no PDS label please fill in the following info
a bunch of slots with most zeros  Yet we could open the
image file in Word and see the label file at the beginning

The compressed image format used for the Voyager disks is not yet
supported by any Macintosh display software that I know of However
there does exist a program that can convert the images to a format that
is recognized by recent versions of both Pixel Pusher and NIHImage It
is called PDS Decompress and is available via anonymous ftp from the
pub directory on delcanomitedu 1875080 This is a Binhex
Stuffit archive and contains the application itself ThinkC source
and a very brief description

The most recent version of NIHImage 148 may be downloaded from
starhawkjplnasagov where it is located in image148hqx in the
pub directory This archive also contains source code but not the
documentation which is located in the image1455hqx archive in the
same directory
