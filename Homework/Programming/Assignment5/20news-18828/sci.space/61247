 I love the idea of an inflatable 1mile long sign It will be a
 really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt  or even better a
 Westford Needle comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec  

 BOOM  Whooooooooshhhhhh  sputter sputter

 okay PRETEND it would make a sound
                 

Just a thought lets pretend it IS INFLATED and PRESSURIZED wouldnt
there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture
If the metalization is behind a clear sandwich ie insulated then the 
deflating balloon would generate electrical interference  noise

By the way any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a Bugs
Bunny hole through the wall highly unlikely to BOOM and the fabric
would almost certainly be ripstop
