George William Herbert sez

Hmm  1 billion lesse I can probably launch 100 tons to LEO at
200 million in five years which gives about 20 tons to the lunar
surface oneway  Say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its
fuel a bigger Mercury or something might get that as low as two
tons leaving fifteen tons for a oneman habitat and a years supplies
Gee with that sort of mass margins I can build the systems off
the shelf for about another hundred million tops  That leaves
about 700 million profit  I like this idea 8  Lets see
if you guys can push someone to make it happen 8 8

I like your optimism George  I dont know doots about raising that kind
of dough but if you need people to split the work and the 700M you just
give me a ring   Living alone for a year on the moon sounds horrid but
Id even try that if I got a bigger cut
