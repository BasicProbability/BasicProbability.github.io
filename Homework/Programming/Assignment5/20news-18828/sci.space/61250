 3  On April 19 a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase

 This activity is regularly reported in Rons interesting posts Could
 someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is

The name is rather descriptive  Its a command to the spacecraft that tells
it If you dont hear from Earth after 264 hours assume something is wrong
with your the spacecraft attitude and go into a preprogrammed search mode
in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth

The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other
Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft and if everything is fine
theres no reason to send it any new information  But from the spacecrafts
point of view no information from Earth could mean either everything is
fine or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition  Just how long
should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and
begins to take corrective action  That how long is the command loss timer
During relatively inactive cruise phases the command loss timer can be set
to rather long values  In this case Earth is telling Galileo expect to
hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours
