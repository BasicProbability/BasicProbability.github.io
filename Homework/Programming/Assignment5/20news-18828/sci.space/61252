Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters  WHere  are they

I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
event and the 1r2 law  So if the 1r2 law is incorrect assume
some unknown material dark matter inhibits Gamma Ray propagation
could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
events happening much closer to us  The even distribution could
be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
being shorter then 12 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy

Just some idle babbling
