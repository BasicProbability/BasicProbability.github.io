Subject Re Command Loss Timer Re Galileo Update  042293

Having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function  However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a NOOP command that does something
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a NOOP command

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion
