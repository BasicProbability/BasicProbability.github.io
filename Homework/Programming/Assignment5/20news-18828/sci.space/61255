  humans and this was published
 in 1986 have already withstood accelerations of 45g All this is very
 longwinded but heres my question finally  Are 45g accelerations in
 fact humanly tolerable  with the aid of any mechanical devices of
 course

are you sure 45g is the right number as far as i know pilots are
blackout in dives that exceed 8g  9g 45g seems to be out of human
tolerance would anybody clarify this please

Actually both numbers are correct  The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration  For pilots accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction youre facing pulling out from a steep dive the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet for instance  In this
case you can only put up with about 8 gs even with a pressure suit  

The record for acceleration though is measured along the direction
youre facing for lack of a better term  As I recall this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the 60s  and was about 40 gs or so
