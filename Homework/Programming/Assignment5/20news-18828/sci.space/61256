Option C  Single Core Launch Station

Ill vote for anything where they dont feel constrained to use stupid
and ugly PC phrases to replace words like manned  If they think
they need to do that theyre more than likely engaging in politics
and public relations as usual rather than seriously wanting to
actually get into space  So that eliminates Option A from the
running  What do they call a manned station in Option C

Im actually about half serious about that  People should be more
concerned with grammatical correctness and actually getting a working
station than they are with Political Correctness of terminology
