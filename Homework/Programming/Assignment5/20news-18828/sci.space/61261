Subject Solid state vs tubeanalog

 Davis Nicoll sez
      Hmmm I seem to recall that the attraction of solid state record
players and radios in the 1960s wasnt better performance but lower
perunit cost than vacuumtube systems

Id buy that for two reasons  The tubes for TVs and radios if you can
still find them are usually 3x or more expensive than comparable transistors

Also ask any electricguitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and
theyll tell you tubetype since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors  Course most of your electric guitar types just say
Tubes sound better dude 

Also transistors have the advantage in both wasteheat and energyuse
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes
