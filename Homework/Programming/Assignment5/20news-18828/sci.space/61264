I know its only wishful thinking with our current President
but this is from last fall

     Is there life on Mars  Maybe not now  But there will be

Lets hear it for Dan Goldinnow if he can only convince the rest of
our federal government that the space program is a worth while
investment

I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars but
we need to address the technical hurdles first  If theres sufficient
interest maybe we should consider starting a scispace group 
devoted to the technical analysis of longduration human spaceflight
Most of you regulars know that Im interested in starting this analysis
as soon as possible
