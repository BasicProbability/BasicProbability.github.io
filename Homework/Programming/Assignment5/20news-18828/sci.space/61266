   From Phil G Fraering pgfsrl03cacsusledu
   Finally this isnt the Bronze Age 
   please try to remember that there are more human activities than
   those practiced by the Warrior Caste the Farming Caste and the
   Priesthood

F Baube responds
   Right the Profiting Caste is blessed by God and may
    freely blare its presence in the evening twilight 

  Steinn Sez
  The Priesthood has never quite forgiven
  the merchants aka Profiting Caste sic
  for their rise to power has it

If we are looking for evidence of belessedbyGodness Id say the ability
to blare lights all over the evening sky is about the best evidence you
could ever hope to get  No wonder the preistly classes are upset
