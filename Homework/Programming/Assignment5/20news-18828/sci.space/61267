Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters How energetic could they be

 If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic would absorption from the
 galaxy be expected  How transparent is the galactic core to gamma
 rays
 
 How much energy does a burster put out  I know energy depends on
 distance which is unknown  An answer of the form X ergs per
 megaparsec2 is OK

        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem  I dont have a calculator but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago so Ill use that and hope its what you wanted  
This is a highly simplified problem with a very simple burst  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here
        Our burst has a peak flux of 543E6 ergs cm2 sec1 and a duration
of 895 seconds  During the frst second of the burst and the last 4 seconds
its flux is half of the peak flux  Its flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time  Assume that the background flux is 10E7 erg cm2 sec1
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst for several
different spheres R25pcOort Cloud Radius R225pcat the edge of the
galaxy R1835pc or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a
R8800Mpc  
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence then used the
old standby formula
                        Luminosity4pir2Fpeak
        For a radius of 25 pc we found an L around 1032 ergsec  Pretty
energetic for close by  for the coronal model we found around 1043 ergsec
And lastly for the cosmological model an L1053 Thats what youd call
moderately energetic Id say  Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second
