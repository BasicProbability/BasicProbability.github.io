are you sure 45g is the right number as far as i know pilots are
blackout in dives that exceed 8g  9g 45g seems to be out of human
tolerance would anybody clarify this please

 Apart from the fact that you get G in the pullout not the dive that
 figure is about right for sustained G no protection
 The duration of G its rate of onset body position and support aids are
 all critical parts of the equation I remember one note about instrumented
 gridiron players recording peaks about 200G Stapp the aviation doctor
 either by accident or design took a shortperiod 80G in a rocketsled
 decelleration eyeballsout against a standard 1950s harness It had
 to be short calculate the stopping time even from 500  600mph at that
 G A bangseat can get up to about 60 G and youd better be sitting
 straight Find the book by MartinBakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
 it can get if the rate of onset is too high A reclining position and a
 good Gsuit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G
 
 A flotation tank should be a good bet since you can treat the body as a
 fluid and highpressure situations are not new Anyone have any figures

Yes a flotation tank combined with floride breathing waterREF the Abyss
breathing solution I think also the right position of the astronaut and
strapping you can probably get much more than 45gs in an accesloration
More like near 100g or somewhat less

Saw I book called the Time Master I thjink that was the title that had some
ideas on how fast and all you could go
