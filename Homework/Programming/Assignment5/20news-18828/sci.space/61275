It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear
shaped than globularspherical  Does anyone make a globe that is accurate
as to actual shape landmass configurationLongLat lines etc
Thanks in advance

Even if they did a globe at a scale that you could fit into your average room
or even average hall the deviations you mention would not be visually
evident In other words a micrometer would be required to test the fact that 
the Globe was infact pearshaped
