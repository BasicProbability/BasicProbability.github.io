	If the  new  Kuiper belt object is  called Karla the next
 one  should be called Smiley

No no no  The previous one was called Smiley  1992 QB1  Smiley
and 1993 FW  Karla

By the way 1992 QB1 can never be known as Smiley officially because
that moniker has already been assigned to asteroid number 1613

Could someone explain where these names come from   Im sure theres a 
perfectly good reason to name a planetoid Smiley but Im equally sure that
I dont know what that reason is
