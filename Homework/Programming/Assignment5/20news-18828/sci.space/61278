I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky
  Sorry you have a wish for an uncluttered night sky but it
isnt a right When you get down to it you actually have no rights
that the majority havent agreed to give you and them in the process
Its a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with
rights to this that and the other Sadly this is not true
  Now if you want to talk about the responsibility that should go with
the power to clutter the night sky then thats a different matter
