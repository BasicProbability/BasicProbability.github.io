Subject France spied on by the US

A young French skeptic who reads skeptically the UFO review OVNI
Presence OP sent me the following excerpt from an August 92
issue of this review RG  Robert Galley French minister of
defense in 1974 answering about the Belgian UFO wave

OP  Can you conceive that the US could allow themselves to send
 their most modern crafts over foreign territory with the Belgian
 hierarchy ignoring that 
RG  Absolutely  The best proof which I can give is that some time
 ago without informing the French authorities the US based in
 Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte  We followed
 this plane and after its landing on the Ramstein airport Colonel X
 got back the shots of Pierrelatte The US had not informed us
 There is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at
Pierrelatte Drome

What kind of plane could it be  Surely not an SR71 which our planes
could not follow and still cant
