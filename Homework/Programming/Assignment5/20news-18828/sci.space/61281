Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days

If reboosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it
then why couldnt HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
here

Is it because two shuttle flights would be required adding to the alredy
horrendous expense

Gruss
