Subject McElwaines secret messages

Robert MacElwaine sez again

                     LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics
 etc

OK I got it  Actually these message of MacElwaines are coded messages
Read only the caps and it all comes clear

               Are a few more types of antimatter atoms worth the 83
          BILLION cost  Dont we have much more important uses for
          this WASTED money

               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed
         location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some
         kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground
         cables  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water
         with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of
         the Supercollider

              Naming the Super Collider after Ronald Reagon as
         proposed is TOTALLY ABSURD  If it is built it should be
         named after a leading particle PHYSICIST

Maybe its a message telling us what actually happened to the legendary
Larson  Perhaps its a warning that one should not expend too much
effort trying to counter MacElwaines postings  Who can be sure
