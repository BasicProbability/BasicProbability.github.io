     So how about this  Give the winning group
   I cant see one company or corp doing it a 10 20 or 50 year
   moratorium on taxes

You are talking about the bozos who cant even manage in November to
keep promises about taxes made in October and you expect them to make
and keep a 50year promise like that  Your faith in the political
system is much higher than mine  I wouldnt even begin to expect that
in Australia and we dont have institutionalised corruption like you
do
