jfc If gamma ray bursters are extragalactic would absorption from the
jfc galaxy be expected  How transparent is the galactic core to gamma
jfc rays

JB So if the 1r2 law is incorrect assume
JB some unknown material dark matter inhibits Gamma Ray propagation
JB could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
JB events happening much closer to us  The even distribution could
JB be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
JB being shorter then 12 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy


 0

 Well maybe not zero but very little  At the typical energies for 
 gamma rays the Galaxy is effectively transparent 

 Hans Bloemen had a review article in Ann Rev Astr Astrophys a few 
 years back in which he discusses this in more depth
