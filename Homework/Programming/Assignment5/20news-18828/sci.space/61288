   What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away
 
 Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
 quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by
 
 Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   
 
   David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic
edged distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or
part of the Oort cloud

Why couldnt they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge
of the gravisphere I know there isnt any mechanism for them but there
isnt a mechanism for the others either
