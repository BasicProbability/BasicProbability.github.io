Also ask any electricguitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and
theyll tell you tubetype since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors  Course most of your electric guitar types just say
Tubes sound better dude 


Of course  they then  turn up the REverb the Gain  add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box  Id think they wouldnt notice the
distortion   Oh I forgot the phase shifters

Also transistors have the advantage in both wasteheat and energyuse
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes


Ah  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems
