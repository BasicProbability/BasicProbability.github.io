Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days


In article 1993Apr270942387682sambaoituncedu BruceScottlaunchpaduncedu Bruce Scott writes
 If reboosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it
 then why couldnt HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
 here
 

Reboost may not be a problem if they have enough fuel  If they dont do a 
reboost this time they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing
mission  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems  The shuttle just isnt designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload

 Is it because two shuttle flights would be required adding to the alredy
 horrendous expense
 

of course that is a concern too and the loss of science during the time
that it is on the ground  plus a fear that if it comes down some
bigwig might not allow it to go back up  but the main concern I
believe is the danger of the landing  Just to add another bad vibe
they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument  Finally 
this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and
service a space station  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing

bringing the telescope down to my understanding was considered
even very recently but all these factors contribute to the 
decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning
