Having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function  However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a NOOP command that does something
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a NOOP command

Using your argument the NOOP operation in a computer isnt a NOOP since it
causes the PC to be incremented

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion

Of course the complaint comes from someone who hasnt a clue as to what hes
talking about

Disclaimer  Hey I understand VAXen and VMS  Thats what I get paid for  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
