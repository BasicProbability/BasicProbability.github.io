 Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a exmilitary 
 establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection 
 of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of 
 the Buran shuttle system  They are located near the NPO Energia 
 facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow 

If this facility is in Kaliningrad this is not near Moscow
it is in fact the exEast Prussian Konigsberg now a Russian
enclave on the Baltic coast  It is served by ships and rail 
and the intrepid traveller in Europe would find it accessible 
and might even want to try to arrange a tour
