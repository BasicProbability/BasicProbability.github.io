Subject Re Vandalizing the sky

Come on this is scispace  An orbital billboard wont
do any permanent damage in a few years it will reenter
and probably hit Los Angles anyway 

The boost to space commerce orbital advertising might
provide might speed the day it is possible for those with a 
yen for dark skies to get some really dark skies beyond
the dust producing the zodiacal light 

Now if they wanted to paint the CocaCola symbol on the
moon in lampblack that would give me pause  It would
be very difficult to reverse such a widespread application
of pigments
