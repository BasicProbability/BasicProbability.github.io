      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

    Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by

    Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges   

      David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic
   edged distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud

   Why couldnt they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere I know there isnt any mechanism for them but there
   isnt a mechanism for the others either

What on Earth is the gravisphere
Anyway before its decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector as does Ulysses they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin

The problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell Closest to
conventional Oort sources is a model of Bfield pinching
by comets its got too many holes in it to count but at
least it was a good try
