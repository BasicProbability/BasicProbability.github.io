Subject Re temperature of the dark sky

In article C65o4tA7ozootorontoedu henryzootorontoedu Henry Spencer writes
Does anyone have a reference something I can look up not just your own
recollections  I have a few of those myself on the temperature of the
night sky as seen from space

Note I am not talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
Radiation  There are more things in the sky than just the MBR what Im
after is total blackbody temperature  what a thermal radiator would see
disregarding or shielding against the Sun and nearby large warm objects
My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially
higher than that of the MBR once you figure in things like stars and the
zodiacal light but Id like numbers

Its not quite what you were asking but a few years ago I helped some EE
remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of
ice they used the sky for a background calibration source  They said that
from Earths surface the sky looks like a 60K blackbody
