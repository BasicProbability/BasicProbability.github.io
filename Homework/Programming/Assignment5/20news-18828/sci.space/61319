    I didnt want to quote all the stuff thats been said recently I
 just wanted to add a point
 
 
 then enforces those rights for them  Here in the US the constitution
 provides a Bill of Rights from which most if not all legal rights are
 considered to derive  Im sure that most other countries have

These seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in but HUH 
All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent 
of the governed not from no steenkin piece of paper  Civilized govmnt 
is not an autonomous computer program its interactive  The Constitution 
was made by the people and can be trashed by us  it aint no sacred 
scripture from which rights flow  Our rights come from our souls 
And I sure didnt see any request to vote on trashing the sky  
Again  my opinion only  we keep our rights by using them not going to 
some court  

 comparable documents  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
 to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights in the
 US you can prevent maybe these billboards from being launched  To
 keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
 and the International Court of Justice correct name in the Hague
 something I know little about
