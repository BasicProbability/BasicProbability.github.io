Only if he doesnt spend more than a billion dollars doing it since the
prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort  You can
spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches

Fine Ill buy from George GEORGEEE

That assumes I cant weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort cut me a
break on the launcher Ill cut you in on the proceeds if it works  Only the
government pays higherthanlist price 

Whats more if you buy Titans the prize money is your entire return on
investment  If you develop a new launch system it has other uses and
the prize is just the icing on the cake

Unless youre Martin Marietta since as I recall they bought out the GD line
of aerospace products 

If MMGD does it as an inhouse project their costs would look much better
than buying at list price  Does anyone REALLY know the profit margins built
in to the Titan  Cmon Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that 

I doubt very much that a billiondollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers  

Oh please  How much of a profit do you want  Pulling 100150 million after
all is said and done wouldnt be too shabby  Not to mention the other goodies
Ill collect in

	a  Movie  TV rights say 100150 million conservatively
	b  Advertising       Look Mommie theyre drinking Coke
	c  Intangibles	      Name recognization experience  data 
				acculumated

Youre going to have to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it

If you want lean fine  A 500 million prize would be more than adequate for a
prize

Maybe Wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
a decent profit

If you want RD done youll have to write in RD clauses  I suppose you could
make it a SBIR setaside
