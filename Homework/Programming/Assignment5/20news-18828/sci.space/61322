   re voyages of discovery
   Could you give examples of privately funded ones

If you believe 1492 the film Columbus had substantial private
funds  When Columbus asked the merchant why he put the money in the
guy said slightly paraphrased  There is Faith Hope and Charity
But greater than these is Banking


Heck some of his ships were loaners One was owned by a Basque
you know one of those groups that probably crossed the Atlantic
before Columbus came along
