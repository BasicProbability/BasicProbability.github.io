Whats more if you buy Titans the prize money is your entire return on
investment  If you develop a new launch system it has other uses and
the prize is just the icing on the cake

Unless youre Martin Marietta since as I recall they bought out the GD
line of aerospace products 

I think youve got an offbyone error in your memory   MM bought the
satellitebuilding side of GE  E not D  MM and GD are still competitors

If MMGD does it as an inhouse project their costs would look much better
than buying at list price

Better yes but were not talking order of magnitude  Especially if you
want to use Titan IV which belongs to the USAF not MM

 Cmon Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that 

Sure you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately
rather than as a gummint project  But were still talking about something
that will cost nine digits per launch unless you can guarantee a large
market to justify volume production
