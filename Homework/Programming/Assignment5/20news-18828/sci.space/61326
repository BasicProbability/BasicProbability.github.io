Subject Space surveillance what I really meant

      Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my 
question about which countries engage in space surveillance 
Unfortunately I apparently didnt make the meaning of the message 
clear since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance 
rather than space surveillance 

     What I meant was not which countries use satellites to look at 
the Earth satellite reconnaissance  but was which countries have 
programs to detect and track ie determine the orbital elements of 
satellites as they pass overhead space surveillance 

    The US uses missiledefense radars supplemented by a fascinating 
quasiradar operated by the Navy to do this for satellites in LEO and 
electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5000 km or so 
The FEE I understand does much the same thing 

    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs binoculars stopwatches 
and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km enabling them to keep track 
of satellites for which ah official element sets arent available 
See the fascinating books by Desmond KingHele for details as well as 
the files in the molczan directory on kilroyjplnasagov  The 
material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in 
optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree and it may be 
that other countries do also 

    Which was the question I meant to ask who are they how do they do 
it and why do they do it
