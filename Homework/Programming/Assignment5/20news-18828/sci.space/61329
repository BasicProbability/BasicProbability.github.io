 Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a exmilitary 
 establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection 
 of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of 
 the Buran shuttle system  They are located near the NPO Energia 
 facility in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow 

If this facility is in Kaliningrad this is not near Moscow

Correction and some more info The Kaliningrad that Mr Larrison
writes about is indeed near Moscow Ive read that it may also be known by
the name Podlipk and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok Star 
City and the Cosmonaut Training Center there I read that the Tsniimach
Central Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building est 1961 
Enterprise was also responsible for creating the NKIK Ground Command and 
Measurement Complex including the Kaliningrad Flight Control Center
which has controlled all SovietRussian manned spaceflights since its
completion in 1973 However it appears to have been a part of the 
Ministry of General Machine Building which was not part of the military
Ministry of Defense but would have been a part of the militaryindustrial
complex
