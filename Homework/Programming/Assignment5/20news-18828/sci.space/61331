Subject Re temperature of the dark sky

radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups  If I
remember things correctly the models involved contributions from three
different BB sources so theres no obvious temperature of background
radiation in our local area

Indeed the sky doesnt look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough in particular its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body  MorganGordons fat
Communications Satellite Handbook has a graph of sky temperature vs
wavelength in fact for communications design

However in terms of energy content the RF frequencies are negligible
For thermal purposes at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at 35K Allen Astrophysical Quantities
I havent found a number for nonlarge distances since solar radiation
tends to be something you cant just ignore  but MG says about 4K
in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem
