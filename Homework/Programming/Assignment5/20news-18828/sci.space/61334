Subject Re Gamma Ray Bursters Where are they

BATSE by having 8 detectors of its own can do its own location determination
but only to within about 3 degrees would someone at GSFC like David like
to comment on the current state of location determination  Having inde
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty
 

Well Ill avoid your question for now got some learnin to do with a
promise to come back with more info when I can find it  I do know that
BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the allsky map of
longterm sources  Given that fact and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx 2 arcmin we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location rotational of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the allsky maps accuracy  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of fractions of a degree if thats 
any help

Speaking of GRO the networld probably was happy to see that the preps
for orbit adjust appear to be going well  Our branch guy whos helping
out says that things have gone smoothly with the isovalve preps and the
burns will take place in midJune

Anyway Im off to find out more  Be back when I get some info
