Subject Re temperature of the dark sky


henryzootorontoedu Henry Spencer writes

 Does anyone have a reference something I can look up not just your own
 recollections  I have a few of those myself on the temperature of the
 night sky as seen from space

     Youll find that in Allen CW Astrophysical Quantities Athlone
Press Dover NH 3rd edition pp 268269 1973  To the accuracy it can
be calculated see specific references in Allen about how it is
calculated the temperature is 3 degrees K

     Lots of people have remarked on this temperature  The first may have
been in Eddingtons book Internal Constitution of Stars Ch 13 1926
reprinted 1986 where he gives the temperature of space as 3 degrees

     The source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight

 My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is
 substantially higher than that of the MBR once you figure in things like
 stars and the zodiacal light but Id like numbers

     To the accuracy of measurement its the same temperature  Some of us
think this may not be a coincidence  Tom
