   This does not propose a mechanism for GRBs in the Oort and no
   antimatter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
   as I understand annihilation spectra Big difference
   Thats ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
   known  in particular comet aphelia which are not well known
   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution

Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right
energy except it doesnt explain why there is no apparent correlation
with galaxies or galaxy structure there is no mechanism for getting
all the energy out in gamma rays with any significant amount of
baryons around there will be a lot of pair production which makes a
plasma which thermalizes the energy it has trouble generating
enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts 105253 ergs it
happens too fast compared to the burst duration and it is hard to
make tightbinaries of neutron stars

Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a
neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars but
that uses pretty farout physics

My point is that we dont have a good mechanism at any distance so
GRBs are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism so we cant
rule out the Oort cloud  What would be the spectrum of an event which
converts a comet to strange matter  The spectra for primordial black
holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets
arent quite right but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which
modifies the spectrum  The energy matches very well for both of these
mechanisms  According to Trevor Weeks if the Tunguska Meteorite
was a miniblack hole collision with the earth then there are likely
to be enough miniblack holes around that the rate for BHcomet
collisions matches the GRB rate well

The fact that we dont know the distribution of comets in the Oort
cloud isnt a reason to rule them out it makes it harder to rule them
out  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the
right distribution for the Oort cloud it is hard but not impossible
to match that up with the distribution of GRBs  If they got the
wrong distribution for the Oort cloud they cant constrain any Oort
cloud GRBs at all

Executive summary we dont know enough to rule out out the Oort
cloud
