	   Alsoif they did come from the Oort cloud we would expect to
   see the same from other stars Oort Clouds

Thats a very good point  Perhaps none of the nearby stars have Oort
clouds  Alphacentauri is a multiplestar system you wouldnt expect
an Oort cloud in it  Whats the nearest singlestar that is likely to
have a planetary system
