Just a few contributions from the space program to regular society

1	Calculators
2	Teflon So your eggs dont stick in the pan
3	Pacemakers Kept my grandfather alive from 1976 until 1988

I dont think touting contributions is a good idea  World War II produced
many many beneficial spinoffs  Eg Radar jet aeroplanes rocket technology
I dont think anyone would argue that World War II was in and of itself
a good thing

If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in
and of itself
