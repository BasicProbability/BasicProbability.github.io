   I assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
   event and the 1r2 law  So if the 1r2 law is incorrect assume
   some unknown material dark matter inhibits Gamma Ray propagation
   could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
   events happening much closer to us  The even distribution could
   be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
   being shorter then 12 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy

I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gammaray
sources at that energy range and their energy doesnt seem to be
significantly absorbed
