Subject Internet resources

I am taking a course entitled Exploring Science Using Internet
For our final project we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
dealing with a sciencerelated topic I chose Astronomy Anyway I was 
wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
that provide information on Astronomy space NASA or anything like that
