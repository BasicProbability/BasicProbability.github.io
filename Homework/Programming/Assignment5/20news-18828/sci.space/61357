    I didnt want to quote all the stuff thats been said recently I
 just wanted to add a point
 
 
 then enforces those rights for them  Here in the US the constitution
 provides a Bill of Rights from which most if not all legal rights are
 considered to derive  Im sure that most other countries have

These seem hardly like the groups to discuss this in but HUH 
All legitimate power to enforce these rights derives from the consent 
of the governed not from no steenkin piece of paper

   We dont disagree on this  All I said was that a right is whatever
you or somebody acting for you can enforce  The Bill of Rights didnt
come into effect until it was ratified by the states and indirectly
the people from that point it defined legal rights  Common law
rights are vague and situational thats why the people insisted on a
Bill of Rights in the Constitution spelling out exactly what they
demanded from the government  Legitimate or illegitimate power is
power  Thats why the federal government can force states to grant
their citizens rights they dont wish to In a slugging match the feds
win  Period

   And youre right this doesnt belong in scispace  Ive said my
peace  No more frome me on rights at least not here

Most gracious regards 
WHH
