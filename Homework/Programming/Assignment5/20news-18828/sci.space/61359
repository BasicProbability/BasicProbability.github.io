 Mike Adams suggested discussions on longterm effects of spaceflight
 to the human being  I love this topic as some of you regulars know

 So having seen Henrys encouraging statement about starting to talk
 about it I shall

 I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
 to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
 on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
 as medical intensive care agriculture environmental protection and 
 probably more  I do not believe that the general public understands
 the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society  In the absence
 of such knowledge we see dwindling support of the worlds space effort

Just a few contributions from the space program to regular society

1	Calculators
2	Teflon So your eggs dont stick in the pan
3	Pacemakers Kept my grandfather alive from 1976 until 1988


ps  To all the regular contributors to scispacenews and
scispaceshuttle thanks for all your hard work keeping us informed
as to the doings down in NASA and other spacetype agencies  I dont
have much time to read USENET but I ALWAYS read these two groups
