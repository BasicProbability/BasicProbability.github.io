 I say
 What Im objecting to here is a floating billboard that presumably
 would move around in the sky  I for one am against legislating
 at all  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy and
 would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things including the night sky
 
 
 Sorry thats an aesthetics argument  maybe this string shoudl mofe to
 scispaceaesthetics
 
 Planes  ruin the night sky  Blimps ruin the night sky  Radio towers
 ruin the night sky  
 
 Like i said  get a vote and create some more national parks  which
 include onobstructed air space
 
 

Hokay  I am hereby voting my backyard to be a sanctuary  one acre 
where I can object to anything I do not like for aesthetic reasons 
  What a relief to know we both can be happy
