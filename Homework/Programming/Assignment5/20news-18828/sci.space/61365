   re voyages of discovery
   Could you give examples of privately funded ones

Much of Cooks later exploration was privately funded by Joseph Banks
among others eg in Resolution  the earlier Endeavour  Colnetts voyage
to the Galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of
British whaling vessels  Chancellor and Willoughby were privately funded
by London merchant companies in their voyages to Muscovy  The list is
almost endless  Those doing the funding were about eighty percent
motivated by potential profit ten percent by potential glory and ten
percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge
