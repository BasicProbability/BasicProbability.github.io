 Cmon Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
or that 

Sure you can get a heavylift launcher fairly cheap if you do it privately
rather than as a gummint project  But were still talking about something
that will cost nine digits per launch unless you can guarantee a large
market to justify volume production

Lets make a deal  If youre going to put up a billion Id want to budget
the whole sheebang for 450600 million  If I have that much money to throw
around in the first place you betcha Im going to sign a contract committing
to volume production



    Software engineering Thats like military intelligence isnt it
