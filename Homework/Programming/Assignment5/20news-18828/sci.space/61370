 The last two are scanned color photos the others are scanned briefing
 charts

 These will be deleted by the icsuciedu system manager in a few days
 so nows the time to grab them if youre interested  Sorry it took
 me so long to get these out but I was trying for the Ames server
 but its out of space

But now I need to clarify the situation  The incoming directory on
icsuciedu does NOT allow you to do an ls command  The files are
there I just checked on 042893 at 935 CDT and you can get them
dont forget the binary mode but you cant ls in the
incoming directory

A further update Marks design made the cover of Space News this week
as one of the design alternatives which was rejected  But hes still
in there plugging  I wish him luck  using ETs as the basis of a
Space Station has been a good idea for a long time

May the best design win
