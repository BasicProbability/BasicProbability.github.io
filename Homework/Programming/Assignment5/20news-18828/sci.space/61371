Subject The Dream Machines book on vaporware spacecraft

Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career  
Ive admired both his paintings remember the USPS Solar System
Exploration Stamps last year and his writings on the history of
spaceflight  For several years hes been working on a big project
which is almost ready to hit the streets  A brochure from his
publisher has landed in my mailbox and I thought it was cool enough
to type in part of it its rather long  Especially given the Nets
strong interest in vaporware spacecraft

This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring fullblown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century  The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one human beings wanted to
reach them   

Tracing the history of the many imaginative and often prescient
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology science astronomy and engineering  Once space travel
became feasible there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board or off the ground for that
matter  These also are described in theis book for the same reason
as the prespaceage and preflight ideas are  they are all accurate
reflections of their particular eras dreams abilities and
knowledge  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500 as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel is listed chronologically  The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures  They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries  They reveal
connections influences and evolutions hitherto unsuspected  Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration  Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing  This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss to visualize
differences similarities and influences

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating  The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship
