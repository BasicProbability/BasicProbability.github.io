people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up
and see a can of Budweiser flying across the sky D

Seen that movie already Or one just like it
Come to think of it they might send someone on
a quest to get rid of the dang thing

 In one of his lesser known books I cant
 remember which one right now the protagonists are in a balloon gondola
 travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon

  Thats Five Weeks In A Balloon  And if anyone can tell me where to
get it I sure would like a reply  Ive been looking for that book for
TEN YEAR and never found it  Note that I am not looking for a 200
collectors item Im hoping that someone has published it in modern
times either in paperback or hardcover  Im willing to spend 50 or
so to get a copy
