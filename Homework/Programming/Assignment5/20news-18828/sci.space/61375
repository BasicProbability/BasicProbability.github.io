Subject Re temperature of the dark sky

   Henry if I read you correctly you may be asking If I put a blackbody
in interstellar space disregarding the Sun and nearby large warm objects
what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation field

Basically the right question although I was interested in cases closer
to home where the Sun is behind either a natural object or effective
shielding

   If thats the case let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are well nottoofar
from being blackbodies
   Inside the disk of the galaxy the temperature varies quite a bit
from place to place

Good point and thanks for the references
