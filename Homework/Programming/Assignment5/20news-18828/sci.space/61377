        Actually my advisor another classmate of mine and me were talking
the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites
THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200
pounds of eq  Well a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it
and 1 alone weighs about 200 pounds itself

Actually the situation is even worse than that  The total mass of the
Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds and most of that is
support equipment like power and communications  The mass available for
instruments is maybe 10 of that  I dont think a BATSE will fit

Actually would you need the shielding  My understanding is that its
mostly there to give the detectors some directionality  No point in
doing that if youve only got one  Im sure the burst detectors that
have flown on other deepspace missions havent weighed that much
Mind you theyre probably still too heavy  the PFF people would put
more Plutospecific instruments on first if they had any mass to spare
