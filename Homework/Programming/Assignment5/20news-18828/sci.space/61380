Subject ASTRONAUTSWhat does weightlessness feel like


 I understand the when one is in orbit the inward force of gravity at
ones center of mass is exactly balanced by the outward centrifugal
force from the orbiting motion resulting in weightlessness

 I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like For example is
there a constant sensation of falling And what is the motion sickness
that some astronauts occasionally experience 

 Please reply only if you are either a former or current astronaut or 
someone who has had this discussion firsthand with an astronaut 
Thanks
