  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems  The shuttle just isnt designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload

Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab 

I cant speak to sheer mass but part of the problem is that HST
wasnt built to ever be brought back down  Its not built for those
kinds of jolt forces and there is no support cradle for it which is
additional weight that would be required
