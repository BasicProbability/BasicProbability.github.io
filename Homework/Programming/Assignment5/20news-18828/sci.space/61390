    Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled
 Habitable Planets for Man I think in 1964  It should be available
 in most good libraries or through interlibrary loan
 

This is the highschool science version the original Rand study by
Stephen H Dole Planets for Man gives the harder numbers  graphs 
such but predates Michael Harts  later work on continuously 
habitable zones

Is this still in print or available other than on loan  I remember
reading this many years ago and its still the best thing I remember
in this vein
