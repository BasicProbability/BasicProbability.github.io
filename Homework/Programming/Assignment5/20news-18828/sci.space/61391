Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days

If reboosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it
then why couldnt HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
here

Im not sure if this is a big issue but it seems to me like it
might be  up till now all 1g forces applied to the mirror and
its mounting and nearly all 1g forces have been applied along the
telescopes optical axis and against the mirrors base  Reentry
would apply forces along roughly the same axis but tending to pull
the mirror away from the mount and the landing would apply onedge
forces to both the mirror and mount  It could be that one or both
of these would not survive
