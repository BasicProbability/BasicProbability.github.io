   But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
 back and you could have problems  The shuttle just isnt designed to land 
 with that much weight in the payload
 
 Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab 
 
 I cant speak to sheer mass but part of the problem is that HST
 wasnt built to ever be brought back down  Its not built for those
 kinds of jolt forces and there is no support cradle for it which is
 additional weight that would be required

Just to throw it out there  The mass of the telescope is 11600 kg 
25500 lb  I do not know what Space lab weighs but I believe it is
less  Can anyone verify

Also remember that weight was not the only concern as many others have 
noted just one possible concern  I was responding to a statement that
if you can boost it why cant you land it  Those are too different
problems
