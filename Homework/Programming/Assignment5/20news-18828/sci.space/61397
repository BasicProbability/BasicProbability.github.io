Subject Displaying compressed Voyager images on a Mac


	Sorry Ive lost track of who asked the question originally 
	our news server at GSFC keeps things around for tremendously
	short periods of time but wanted to be certain before I
	replied Someone asked about displaying the compressed images
	from the Voyager imaging CDROMs on a Mac As Peter Ford MIT
	pointed out a decompression program is available via FTP
	Sorry I dont remember the name of the node offhand 
	although its mitedu In any case though one of the MAC
	display programs CD ROM Browser by Dana Swift does display
	the compressed images directly The program is shareware and
	is distributed by NSSDC for nominal reproduction costs 9 
	shipping if memory serves This does not cover the
	shareware price which should go to Dana for his diligent work
	and upgrades however

	To request current pricing information information about
	available display software catalogs or data from NSSDC
