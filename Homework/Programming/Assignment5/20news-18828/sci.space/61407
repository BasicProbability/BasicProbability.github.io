Flight Sequence C9 is active as of 0011 AM Tuesday April 27  With
activities beginning at shortly before 500 AM yesterday C9 commanded
the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the MAG
Magnetometer Team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and
orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the
spacecraftgenerated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument

The spacecraft was commanded back to Sun Star Init state at 907 AM to
reestablish Inertial Reference  Transition back to Array Normal Spin
began at 1117 AM after which the sequence powered on the onboard
transmitter at 1118 AM  Telemetry reacquisition occurred at
approximately 1130 AM at the 4 KBS Science and Engineering downlink
data rate on the High Gain Antenna  Subsystem engineers report that all
systems appear to be nominal  The command to terminate using the Low
Gain Antenna for uplink was sent at 1231 PM  Uplink and Downlink are
currently via the HGA

MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3
Playback of DTR 2 is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between
811 AM and 1242 PM  Playback of DTR 3 is scheduled to take place
tomorrow evening beginning at 1157 PM and ending at 428 AM on Friday
DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42667 bits
per second  Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks downlink will
be maintained at the 4K S  E rate

The MAG Cal activity timeline ends at shortly before 500 AM on Friday
morning
