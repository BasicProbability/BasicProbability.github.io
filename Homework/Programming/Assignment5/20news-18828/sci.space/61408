  Subject RE Level 5 Shuttle Software Work

  Bret

  If you are familiar with the software work that received the Level 5
  rating could you post a description of it andor some references  I
  think many people would be interested to know just what the IBM team
  on that effort is doing differently from most other organizationsprojects
  that earned them that rating

I am familiar with the project  It is the Onboard Shuttle Flight
Software Project  This software controls the Space Shuttle During
all dynamic phases as well as onorbit
It has ultrahigh reliability and extremely
low error rates  There have been several papers published on the
subject and Ill collect some references  There may be an
article in the IBM Systems Journal Late 93 early 94

There is no magic formula  We did it with dedicated and disciplined
folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors
and is corrected based on errors that escape  We present a
one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks
The next one is May 19th in Washington DC  I can fax specifics
to those who are interested
