If reboosting the HST by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it
then why couldnt HST be brought back to earth and the repair job done
here
 
Is it because two shuttle flights would be required adding to the alredy
horrendous expense
 

I dont think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landinglaunch
in terms of stressesmisalignmentsetc  I would think of the reboost as
a gentile push where a landing then launch as two JOLTS which would
put more mechanical stress on the instruments  Additionally there might
be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
landing  Finally probably some thought went into possible contamination 
problems if the instruments came back to earth

Of course the cost of two shuttle launches is a good reason to avoid
something that might be done in one shuttle launch  Heres hoping
Cepis gang gets the job done right the first time
