  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems  The shuttle just isnt designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload

Is HST really that much heavier than a Spacelab 

HST is about 25500 lbs 11600 kg  That doesnt include the cradle that
would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed  SpacelabJ on STS47
was 21861 lbs according to the presskit 

As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some
reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this
was a planned for contingency  This is not a problem for the shuttle
though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site they still have to go to
Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay
