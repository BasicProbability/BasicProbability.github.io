Subject Interstellar T is 34K notes on PlutoCharon talk and Pluto Mission

   scispace readers can skip the first paragraph

  Yesterday in response to Henry Spencers question about the 
temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space I said Dust grains
acts as blackbodies and theyre at 40150 K  Well I was dead
wrong  Our local interstellar dust expert Bruce Draine has
informed me that dust grains arent good radiators in the far IR
which is why they are so warm actually the ambient radiation field
from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin
Sorry Henry and anyone else I misled  Obviously time for me to
take another ISM class 

  In other news Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave
a talk on the PlutoCharon binary system yesterday  He gave a brief
overview of the currentlyaccepted system parameters volume ratio of
about 81 mass ratio about 151 or so plus lots more and then
gave his thoughts on the formation of PlutoCharon  His idea is 
that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer
solar system with masses distributed as a power law of some kind
over time the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies  Most got
scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter
and Saturn but many accreted into the gas giants especially
Uranus and Neptune  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune 
we call it Triton captured how  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller
alreadyexisting Neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through
Neptunes atmosphere  mondo aerobraking

  He notes that the two recently discovered Kuiper Belt objects
1992 QB1 and 1993 FW plus Chiron and Pholus are all about the same 
mass and he identifies this group as oneaccretiondown from the
larger bodies of Triton and PlutoCharon  PlutoCharon he thinks
formed when an impacting body hit protoPluto knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon similar to
ideas about the formation of Earths moon  There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different
Pluto has methane frost Charon doesnt which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory

  He believes that there may be around 1000 PlutotoChironsized objects
remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptunes 
orbit beyond 35 AU or so  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members
of this population to be found in his model  Note that such bodies
will be very dark since if their surfaces are covered with methane 
frost it will have photolyzed into very dark longchain hydrocarbons
by now  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo around 05 I think
is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate
and when the atmosphere freezes out again thirty years later it forms
bright new frost  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going
to be very hard to see

  I hope I havent made any errors in the transcription if you see
a howling mistake its undoubtedly mine not his

  By the way hes one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby
mission I think and said that the current plans are to use a
Titan 4 to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory
to Pluto we were speaking loosely at the time  Hed like
to use a Proton which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs
MUCH less  His figures 500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches there
will be two separate probes launched separately or 120 Million
for 2 Proton launches  He told a story about how the Soviets originally
offered to sell Proton launches for 30 Million each but were forced
to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the
marketplace

  Im just telling you what he said
