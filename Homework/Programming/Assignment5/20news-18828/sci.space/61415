Subject Re Command Loss Timer Re Galileo Update  042293

Having read in the past about the failsafe mechanisms on spacecraft I had
assumed that the Command Loss Timer had that sort of function  However I
always find disturbing the oxymoron of a NOOP command that does something
If the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
a NOOP command

Of course this terminology comes from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory which has
nothing to do with jet propulsion


	I dont know where you got this idea from JPLs history dates back to 
	to the 1930s when a Caltech professor named Von Karman conducted  
	experiments in rocket PROPULSION with a group of graduate students
	on the present site of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory   The Army started
	funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late 1950s when
	NASA took over The early research conducted at the Laboratory
	led to many applications the first being Jetassisted takeoff rockets
	for aircraft  I think this should explain where JPL got its name I
	should know I worked there for five wonderful years
