                               POSTLAUNCH
                           April 23  29 1993

SPACECRAFT

1  On April 22 and 23 delta Differenced Oneway Range DOR passes were
performed over DSS1463 GoldstoneMadrid 70 meter antennas and DSS1443
GoldstoneCanberra 70 meter antennas respectively  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed

2  On April 23 a cruise science Memory Readout MRO was performed for the
Magnetometer MAG instrument  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly

3  On April 23 the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
Command Data Subsystem prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relayswiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge IESD

4  On April 26 cruise science Memory Readouts MRO were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer EUV Dust Detector DDS and Magnetometer
MAG instruments  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly

5  During the period from April 26 to April 27 a navigation cycle was
performed  This navigation cycle provided nearcontinuous acquisition of
twoway doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS63 DSS14 and DSS43

6  On April 26 realtime commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna RRA in preparation for the minisequence slew test on April 28
The RRA was slewed from approximately 35 degrees from stow to approximately
203 degrees  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
degrees which was well within the predicted range  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately 152 degrees from stow  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about 158 degrees also well within the predicted range  The
RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to 16 degrees C at its completion

     After verifying proper RRA slewing the RRA slew test minisequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28  Upon successful uplink
a Delayed Action Command DAC was sent which will reposition the stator on
May 4 to its initial pretest position  Also a DAC was sent to turn the
TwoWay Noncoherent TWNC on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test
minisequence

7  On April 27 a NOOP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours its planned value during this mission phase

8  On April 28 the RRA slew test executed nominally  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees
from stow and going to 53 degrees back to 25 degrees then to 51 degrees
back to 22 degrees then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range  The RRA motor temperature was
at 23 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 44
degrees C at its completion  After completion of the RRA slews realtime
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pretest configuration

9  The ACDC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
greater than 25 DN throughout this period  The AC measurement reads 17 DN
39 volts  The DC measurement reads 134 DN 157 volts  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ACDC special
anomaly team

GDS Ground Data Systems

1  The first GalileoGDS test of the MGDS V180 Command System CMD took
place April 27 1993 with DSS61 Madrid 34 meter antenna  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
Deep Space Network Group 5 Command Processor Assembly CPA  The test was
successful and the next test for V180 CMD is scheduled for May 1 1993 with
DSS15 Goldstone 34 meter antenna

2  The April System Engineers Monthly ReportSEMRGround System Development
Office GSDO MMR was conducted Thursday April 29   A review of current
Project and Institutional DSN and MOSO system status was conducted  Ongoing
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday April 29 1993 the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows

	Distance from Earth         187745300 km 126 AU
	Distance from Sun           296335800 km 198 AU
	Heliocentric Speed          89100 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       522015800 km
	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes 58 seconds

SPECIAL TOPIC

1  As of April 29 1993 a total of 70259 realtime commands have been
transmitted to Galileo since Launch  Of these 65150  were initiated in the
sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the realtime command process
In the past week 74 real time commands were transmitted 73 were initiated
in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command
process  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial
RRA slew test uplink the RRA slew test minisequence DACs to reposition the
stator and turn the TWNC on reset the command loss timer and execute the
RRA slew test
