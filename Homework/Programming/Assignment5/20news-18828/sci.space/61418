 ANNOUNCEMENT	The HyperKnowledge PROJECT for NeXTSTEP
 
 I know this is kinda off the subject of scispace but not really I want to
 answer this for their as well as everyone elses information  What these
 people are proposing by and large already exists and can be purchased today
 
 It is called labview by National Instruments IT is a wonderful object
 IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language
 some lines deleted

I am afraid you are misdirected NeXTSTEP is an operating system as opposed to 
a package I have read a little about it but since Steve Jobs does not seem to 
have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info is limited Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed but that
is another flameridden story Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC graphical objectoriented design its all WSIWIG postscript 
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing and best of all it is based around 
the Mach microkernel so you can make it look like Unix with X or DOS or NT or 
even VMS if you feel the need No package out there comes even close I hope 
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally
takes off in my lifetime
