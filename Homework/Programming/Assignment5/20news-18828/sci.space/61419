	   Alsoif they did come from the Oort cloud we would expect to
   see the same from other stars Oort Clouds

Thats a very good point  Perhaps none of the nearby stars have Oort
clouds  Alphacentauri is a multiplestar system you wouldnt expect
an Oort cloud in it

Sure about that Maybe Proxima might cause problems but at Oort
Cloud distances AC a and AC b together look like a point source

Besides even the solar systems Oort cloud is unstable over
geologic time right and needs to be replentished from somewhere
else like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt

Or maybe Im misremembering something I read or heard somewhere

  Whats the nearest singlestar that is likely to
have a planetary system

Until were able to perform a broadband survey of nearby stars
to detect planets we wont know enough to say whether or not
a single star has planets And were likely to find out about the
close ones first

Heck if neutron stars can have planets anything can have planets
Or was that discovery disconfirmed


Phil Fraering         Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff
