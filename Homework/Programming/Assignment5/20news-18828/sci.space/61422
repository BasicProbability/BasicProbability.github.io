 kc But back to the contest goals there was a recent article in AWST
about a
 kc low cost its all relative manned return to the moon  A General
 kc Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV  Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
 kc stage LEV and crew capsule  The mission consists of delivering two
 kc unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission
 kc Total cost  US was 1013 billion  Joint ESANASA project was
69
 kc billion for the US share

 kc moon for a year   Hmmm  Not really practical  Anyone got a
 kc cheaperbetter way of delivering 1520 tonnes to the lunar surface
within
 kc the decade  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a years
 kc supply of consumables and equipment would weigh

Why not modify the GD plan into Zurbrins Compact Moon Direct scheme let
one of those early flight carry an O2 plant and make your own
