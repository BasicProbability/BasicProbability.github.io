 wAC The Apollo program cost something like 25 billion at a time when
 wAC the value of a dollar was worth more than it is now No one would
 wAC take the offer

If we assume 6 inflation since 1969 that 25B would be worth about 100B
GD reckon a moon mission today could cost only 10B Thats a factor of ten
reduction in cost It might be possible to reduce that number futher by
using a few shortcuts  Russian rockets   Asuming it gets built I think
the Delta Clipper could very well achive the goal
