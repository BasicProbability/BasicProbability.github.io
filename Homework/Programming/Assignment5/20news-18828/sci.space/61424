Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days

Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it

Caution speculation mode engaged
There is another consideration that hasnt been mentioned yet
I expect that retrieving HST would involve damaging it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay  Most of the deployed
items antennas and especially the solar arays probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position even by hand  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts  The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that dont ring due
to thermal cycle stresses

I also expect that as has been discussed the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue but that the reentry loads are
much less so  Can the moveable optical components even be recaged
I assume that they were caged for launch
