I expect that retrieving HST would involve damaging it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay  Most of the deployed
items antennas and especially the solar arays probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position even by hand

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the arrayflapping problems

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated  it would be costly would
involve extensive downtime and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to relaunch it and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination
