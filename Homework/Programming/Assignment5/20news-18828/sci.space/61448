 I am taking a course entitled Exploring Science Using Internet
 For our final project we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
 dealing with a sciencerelated topic I chose Astronomy Anyway I was 
 wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
 that provide information on Astronomy space NASA or anything like that

Do you know of the worldwideweb  This is a global hypertext well 
hypermedia network running on the internet  One of the nice things
about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
other systems being used like WAIS Gopher FTP Archie etc  It
is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web

If youd like to explore Id suggest getting the XMosaic program
written at the NCSA  Its an Xwindows web browser and is pretty
slick  It can understand and cope with more than text gif jpeg mpeg
audio etc  There are other browsers including a textmode browser
for people stuck on a text terminal but Im most familliar with mosaic

Under the page The WorldWide Web Virtual Library Subject Catalogue
this is available under the Documents menu in mosaic or by any
browser via the URL 
httpinfocernchhypertextDataSourcesbySubjectOverviewhtml 
there is a subject Space Science  Currently this points to a
page under construction with only the NASA JPL FTP archive  Ive
volunteered to take over this page and in fact I have a replacement
with all sorts of information pointers mostly gleaned from the
scispace FAQ  As soon as the overworked Subject Catalogue 
maintainer switches the Space Science pointer itll be visible

Ill post a short note when this happens
