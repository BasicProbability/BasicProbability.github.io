Subject Re Philosophy Quest  How Boldly

There are a number of Philosophical questions that I would like to ask

1  If we encounter a life form during our space exploration how do we
determine if we should capture it imprison it and then discect it

   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago  The question was if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington DC what was the proper organization to deal with it The
State Department alien ambassadors the Defense Department alien
invaders the Immigration and Naturalization Service illegal aliens
the Department of the Interior new nonhuman species etc  It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens not of anything
intrinsic in their nature  The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper the name and author of which I sadly forget I
believe the author was Italian on what constitutes a legal andor moral
person ie a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person  The paper was quite interesting as I recall

2  If we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly will
we expend resources from earth to help them

   I think youd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes  The
human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges is terrible  The
usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
culture  This may not always be wrong but thats the way to bet

3  With all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable
what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases arent brought
back or that our deseases dont destroy life elsewhere

 
Have a day
