 I am taking a course entitled Exploring Science Using Internet
 For our final project we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
 dealing with a sciencerelated topic I chose Astronomy Anyway I was 
 wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
 that provide information on Astronomy space NASA or anything like that
 
 THANKS

Try doing a keyword search under Gopher using Veronica or accessing a 
World Wide Web server Also finger yanoffcsd4csduwmedu for a list
of Internet resources which includes 23 sites with Spacespecific 
information I am sure Ron Baalke will have told you about what is
available at JPL etc
