It has been known for quite a while that the earth is actually more pear
shaped than globularspherical  Does anyone make a globe that is accurate
as to actual shape landmass configurationLongLat lines etc

I dont think youre going to be able to see the differences from a sphere
unless they are greatly exaggerated  Even the equatorial bulge is only
about 1 part in 300  youd never notice a 1mm error in a 30cm globe 
and the other deviations from spherical shape are much smaller

I remember a physic prof who talked about scaling a cue ball to Earth size
Its was significantly less spherical that the Earth
