Subject US Government and Technolgy Investment

People who criticize big Government and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology  Basically the US Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
longterm  

Historically this role for the US Govt was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries  In order for US  industries to
compete with governmentsubsidized foreign competitors the US Govt
has taken on the role of subisizing bigticket or longlead RD

As a Republican I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way  I believe that market forces should
drive technology and the world would be a better place for it  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously or
some countries would have subsidized RD while others would not  So
the US must subsidize because everybody else does  This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations
doesnt it

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
costeffectiveness  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture
despite the forces in the business world like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report which erode the ability of US industry to invest in
new technology  And since our goal is to spend money it makes little
sense to try to save money

Of course we could always spend our money more wisely but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be  

Its interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects
GANTT charts CPM and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses every large
construction project now uses these tools

     A scientist can discover a new star but he cannot make one
      He would have to ask an engineer to do that
