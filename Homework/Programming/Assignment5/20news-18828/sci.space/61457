Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days

In article C6A2AtE9zzootorontoedu henryzootorontoedu Henry Spencer writes

No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the arrayflapping problems


Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable  if the shuttle is going
to retunr the HST  what bother are some arrays  just fit them with a quick release

one  space walk  or use the second canadarm to remove the arrays
