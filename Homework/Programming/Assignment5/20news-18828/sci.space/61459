 	As Herny pointed out you have to develop the thruster
 Also while much lighter you still have to lift the mass of
 the thruster to orbit and then the thruster lifts its own 
 weight into a higher orbit  And you take up room in the payload
bay

 
 a yes  but the improvement in  boost orbit to the HST is Significant

I do not understand what you are saying here  What is improved what 
is Significant and what does this have to do with carrying more 
equipment on a servicing mission  Also as implied by other posters why 
do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway  Maybe you have 
something here but could you please clarify it for us on the net 


RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days  before
it was listed as 9 days  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to 5  after simulations indicated  that it was not doable in 4  

After all the space walking  they are going to  reboost the HSTs
orbit  I think right now  its sitting  at 180 miles up
they would like  220  I dont know the exact orbit numbers
I know when HST was first flown it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet or extended
duration orbiter pallet  Its mostly  LOXLH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support
rebreathers  maybe more nitrogen too

THe limit on spacewalking is a function of suit supplies MASS
and Orbiter Duration   

In order to perform the reboost of the HST the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing  THe HST isnt light either  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on its own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle
for a given orbital change  

From what i understand  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they cant even carry extra Suits or MMUs

Now if they used a small tug  I would bet  just a wild guess
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet  extra suits  more consumables  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor  parts for the balky solar  electronics

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit
The reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing
and longer drag life

 and  that means you can then carry EDO packs  and enough consumables
 so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the
 array tilt motors  and god knows what else  is going to wear out

From what Ive heard the motors are fine  it is one of the two 
sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix  The 
motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware  I expect 
to be corrected if Im wrong on this 


a
Whatever it is  the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint
on HST ops
