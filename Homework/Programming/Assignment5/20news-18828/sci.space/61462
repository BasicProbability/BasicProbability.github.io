It said that in the 60s they developed a rocket that used ions or nuclear
particles for propolsion
The government however didnt give them 1billion for the developement

Id guess this was a garbled report of the NERVA effort to develop a
solidcore fission rocket the most mundane type of nuclear rocket
That was the only advancedpropulsion project that was done on a large
enough scale to be likely to attract news attention  It could be any
number of things  the description given is awfully vague  but Id
put a small bet on NERVA
