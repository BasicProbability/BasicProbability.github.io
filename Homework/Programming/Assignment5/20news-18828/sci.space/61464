Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
keep watch 

There would be some point to doing longterm monitoring of things like
particles and fields not to mention atmospheric phenomena  However
there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network
To be precise there is no particular plan period  This is a large
part of the problem  In this context its not surprising that unexciting
but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time  The closest
approach to any sort of longterm planetary monitoring mission is the
occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier
mission like Galileo or Cassini

How about a mission unmanned to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto

It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be
worth monitoring and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly
without new propulsion technology something the planetary community
has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for  The combined need to
arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time and then kill nearly
all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit is beyond what can
reasonably be done with current that is 1950svintage propulsion

It could do some scanning of not only Pluto but also of the solar system
objects near and aaroundpluto as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
without having much of the solar system to worry about

Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth  The few things
that cant be can be done better from a Voyagerlike spacecraft that is
not constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet
