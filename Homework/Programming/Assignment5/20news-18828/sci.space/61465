 THe limit on spacewalking is a function of suit supplies MASS
 and Orbiter Duration   

 In order to perform the reboost of the HST the OMS engines
 will be fired for a long period  Now the shuttle is a heavy
 thing  THe HST isnt light either  THe amount of OMS fuel
 needed to fly both up is substantial   a small booster
 carried up and used to boost HST on its own will weigh significantly
 less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle
 for a given orbital change  

 From what i understand  the mass margins on the HST missions are
 tight enough they cant even carry extra Suits or MMUs

 pat

I havent seen any specifics on the HST repair mission but I cant see why
the mass margins are tight  What are they carrying up  Replacement components
WFPC II COSTAR gyros solar panels and probably a few others all sorts of
tools EVA equipment and as much OMS fuel and consumables as they can  This
should be lighter than the original HST deployment mission which achieved the
highest altitude for a shuttle mission to date  And HST is now in a lower 
orbit  

Seems like the limiting factors would be crew fatigue and mission complexity
