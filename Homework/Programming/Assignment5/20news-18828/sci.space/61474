The Forever War one of my favorite SciFi books had a passage devoted to 
breathing fluids The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in drycleaning 
fluid saturated with oxygen Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book
I would certainly recommend it won the Hugo and the Nebula awards

And most definitely read it in conjunction with Heinleins Starship
Trooper  The two books are radically different viewpoints of the
same basic premises  Ive even heard tell of English classes built
around this
