 If you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in
 and of itself

I think we should tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program  That is the only way you can prove
its worth to them  and they vote and pay taxes too  The continued
existence of the space program relies upon that money

I have to agree with Ward  The problem with your approach is they add
up what you can reasonably claim as spinoffs add up whats been
spent on space and then come back with something like You spent X
billion for that  Wouldnt it be better just to spend the money on
direct research and forget all this space stuff  We could have got
all that stuff a lot cheaper that way  Space is wasteful and
inefficient

Then they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of
New Guinea tribesmen or something
