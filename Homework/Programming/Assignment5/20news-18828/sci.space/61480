Subject Boeing TSTO Was Words from Chairman of Boeing

Re Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO 
As far as single stage to orbit technology we think that we have
a better answer in a two stage approach and we are talking to some
of our customers about that  As far as commercialization that is
a long ways off  
 Anybody know anything further Is this really news Does this
threaten further work on DC 
  
   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time  A good reference on this might be Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced EarthToOrbit ETO Applications IAF92
0639 by VA Weldon and LE Fink from Boeing   The paper
describes a propanefueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraftlike operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel  Basically its a highspeed
airplane launching a Hermestype spaceplane
   The design the concept is also called Beta as laid out in the
paper can launch at least 10000 pounds into polar orbit or 20000
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support  System design reliability is 9995
   Beta is a 360footlong first stage powered by two large ramjets
and 12 high speed civil transport HSCT turbofans  A 108foot
long reusable orbiter is trapezemounted in the belly of the first
stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage
   To launch the orbital vehicle the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3  At that point the turbofans
modified to burn catalyzed JP7 would shut off and the ramjets
would take over  At Mach 55 the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out ignite and proceed to orbit Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about 15 M lbs roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An225
The orbiter stages weighs about 400Klbs including 335 Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15by
25foot cargo bay and the twoseat orbiter crew station LOX would
be stored aft  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this designs
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the highdensity supercooled hydrocarbon fuel
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost a TSTO is easier
cheaper and less risky to develop simpler to build has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesnt carry the hardtohandle
and bulky hydrogen fuel The conlcude In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel as well as its inherent self
ferry capability it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airlinelike operations as possible with a practical
configuration until a single stage airbreatherrocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable
  
Is this really news Does this threaten further work on DC
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time  I expect this or a similar concept perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase is being re
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter
   Does it threaten DC  Possibly  There is a set of ongoing
studies trying straighten out the governments future space
transportation strategy  MDC and Boeing as well as other firms
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC  There are
various factions and options vying for attention  including
shuttle upgrades shuttle replacement what was called the 423
architecture SpaceLifter ELV upgrades and various advanced
vehicles ALES Beta DC NASP FSTS SSTOs of several types
etc  NASADODDOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US govt space transportation systems and trying to
juggle nearterm launch needs like for DoD and NASA against
mediumterm needs including commercial considerations and against
the investment and risk of going to leap frog new technologies
like SDIOSSTO and NASP and Beta
   Its a heck of a problem  The worst part of the problem isnt
that there arent promising ideas and concepts  there are dozens
of them  but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in
the near term  They should have a draft report in midJune with a
final report coming by the end of the fiscal year
