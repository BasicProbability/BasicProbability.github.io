I was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky
 
 And from whence does this right stem that it overrides the rights
 of the rest of us
 
 Let me get this right  sorry try again  Let me get this straight  
well maybe that too is a poor choice of words  someone might think 
Im pushing a gay agenda  How about  let me try to understand this 
by rephrasing it as an extreme  I as a minority of one have no right 
to a beautiful world  You on the other hand have the right to make an 
ugly one because you presume to speak for all the rest  And I cannot 
complain  Curious 

 

I say
What Im objecting to here is a floating billboard that presumably
would move around in the sky  I for one am against legislating
at all  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy and
would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things including the night sky
 
 Oh I see  You dont want any legislation that might impinge on you
 you just want everyone else on the planet to do what you want
 

And do you want everyone to do as you wish insist on putting something 
up that will impact everyone for selfish reasons without any legislation  
And no one else can even object  Somehow I think this whole shoving 
contest has gotten way off the track  Im ready to let this thread 
die a quick and merciful death 

  
 Insisting on perfect safety is for people who dont have the balls to live
