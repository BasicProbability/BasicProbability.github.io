 the Single Launch Core Station concept  A Shuttle external tank and solid
 rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit  Shuttle
 main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
 and jettisoned after ET separation
 
 Why jettison the SSMEs  Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle 
 bring them down to use as spares

Good questionI asked that myselfHowever since this option is as
expensive as the Freedom derivative the issue will likely be moot
