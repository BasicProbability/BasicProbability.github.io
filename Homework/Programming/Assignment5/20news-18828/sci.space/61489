I think we should tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program  That is the only way you can prove
its worth to them  and they vote and pay taxes too  The continued
existence of the space program relies upon that money

just my 02

BTW dont forget Velcro

at least be honest  velcro tm dates from the 40s  i have doubts
about everything listed above  just because it was developed in the
space age doesnt mean it was a space spinoff  

BTW  dont forget Tang
