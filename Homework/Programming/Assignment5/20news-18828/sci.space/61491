Im wondering if vandalize is the proper word to use in this situation  My
dictionary defines vandalism as the willful or malicious destructuion of 
public or private property especially of anything beautiful or artisitc I
would agree the sky is beautiful but not that it is public or private property

Its public because it belongs to everybody 

No the sky does not at this time belong to anyone  Ownership is necessary
to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
action was good or bad  If neither you or I own a brick wall then I cant
unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right and you dont
have the authority to declare that it is wrong  The owner may find it artistic
or she may be call the police

this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights

Its vandalism because many people  power companies  do maliciously waste light 

maliciously implies evil intent  The lighting companies arent going out
of their way to spoil the sky  They just dont care

If they can sell you
or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent
of its light they make more money  Never mind that your money is wasted

It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware
If thats what your city will buy thats what the lighting company will sell
Write a letter to city hall

Please note that Im not defending light pollution  The orignial focus of 
this thread was space based light sources
