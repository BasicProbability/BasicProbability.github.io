                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April 30 1993
                              1130 AM PDT

DSS65 Madrid 34 meter antenna did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning 429
at approximately 600 AM  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass DSS15  Goldstone 34
meter antenna at approximately 800 PM the evening before  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem Starex performed  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 130 AM
yesterday 42993  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection  However the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days

As of last evening the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode  The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today

Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency
Mode entry  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape
Recorders 2 and 3  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3 scheduled to be completed
yesterday was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight
Sequence C9 execution  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart
C9 to complete data playback  Present planning is to perform playbacks
between  as soon as Wednesday or as late as Friday of next week 55
57 dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity  DTR playback will
be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42667 bits per second  Upon
verification of successful DTR playbacks downlink will be maintained at
the 4K S  E rate
