 COMMERCIAL SPACE NEWSSPACE TECHNOLOGY INVESTOR NUMBER 22

    This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
 feasibility of a commercial launch site  These include
    Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
 sufficient to recover setup costs
    Is there a market advantage of using the site
    Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site
    Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
 investment  
    Other commercial launch site ventures  including those at 
 Woomera Poker Flat Cape York White Sands Alabama OffShore 
 Platform Hawaii and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
 these criteria  In my opinion some of these ventures are flying 
 on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds

This reminds me my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking
of reviving the San Marco launch platform off the coast of Kenya
where the Copernicus satellite was launched around 1972  Is this
true or am I imagining it  Possibly its connected with one of the
Italian programs to revive the Scout in a new version

That old platform must be getting pretty rusty and there aint a lot
of infrastructure to go with it
