Subject Re Internet resources

STK1203VAX003STOCKTONEDU Pontificated 
I am taking a course entitled Exploring Science Using Internet
For our final project we are to find a compendium of Internet resources 
dealing with a sciencerelated topic I chose Astronomy Anyway I was 
wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on Internet
that provide information on Astronomy space NASA or anything like that


One of the scispace FAQ postings deal with this  Its archived
somewhere  Perhaps someone can post where it is I don
remember
