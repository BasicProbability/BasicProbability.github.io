Also ask any electricguitar enthusiast which type of amp they prefer and
theyll tell you tubetype since tubes have lower distortion and noise
than transistors  Course most of your electric guitar types just say
Tubes sound better dude 

Of course  they then  turn up the REverb the Gain  add in the analog
delay line  and the Fuzz box  Id think they wouldnt notice the
distortion   Oh I forgot the phase shifters

It is kind of absurd isnt it  Some players even want more distortion
especially the Hendrix fans   But there are a lot of them out there
that can only afford the amp or who like playing music without distortion
Then there are your hardcore Hendirx fans that want particular types
of distortion ie they make it not their amps

Also transistors have the advantage in both wasteheat and energyuse
mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes

Ah  but how do they compare to Mechanical systems 

I didnt see a thing about wasteheat from Babbage and havent seen one
of those mechanical TVs in a while so its anybodies guess
