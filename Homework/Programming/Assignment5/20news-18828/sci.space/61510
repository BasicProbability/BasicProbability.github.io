Subject Vandalizing the sky

Dale sez
Mr Hathaways post is right on the money if a little lengthy  In short
an orbiting billboard would be trash in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash  Billboards make a place look trashy  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people dont feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky

I dont buy it  If the things had no value at all people wouldnt
spend money to make them So their lack of value is just your
opinion not an actual fact which is neither a philisophical or
legal basis for prohibiting them

On the other hand I lived in OakBrook IL for a while where zoning
laws prohibit billboards as you mention above  I think it was a
fine law despite its contradictory basis

I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would
be violation of private property  I bought this house out in
the boondocks specifically to enjoy my hobby amateur astronomy  Now
this billboard has made that investment worthless so I want the
price of the property in damages  It wouldnt take too many
succesful cases like that to make billsats prohibitively expensive
