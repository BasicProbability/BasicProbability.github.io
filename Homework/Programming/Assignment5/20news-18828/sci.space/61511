Subject Hall Generators from USSR

Hi Folks

              Last year America bought two  Hall Generators which are
used as thrusters for space vehicles from former USSRif I could recall
correctly these devices were sent to JPLPasadena labs for testing and
evaluation
     
              I am just curious to know  how these devices work and what
what principle is involved what became of themThere was also some
controversy that the Russian actually cheatedsold inferior devices and
not the one they use in there space vehicles

Any info will be appreciated
  ok                            Thank in advance
