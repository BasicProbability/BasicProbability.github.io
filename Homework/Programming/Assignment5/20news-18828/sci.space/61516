Subject Mothership for Flybys and cutting costs

Getting wierd again

Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to
expensive

Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts Kind of liek the old
MIRV principle of old Cold War Days 
Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missionsnamely different planets Each probe would be tied in with
the mother ship or earth as the case may be This is good when and if we go
for Mars the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the
probes

Also the mother ship would be powered if not the Mars Mission by a normal
propulsion but also a solar sail main reason for solar sail race is to see
what can be done and autmoated the sail would get the probes to were they
needed I know the asteroidmeteor clouds and such might get in the way of a 
Sail

Main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send
multiple probesmissionsatellitesexploreres to different places and cut
costs
The probes could do fly bys or  we shall see
