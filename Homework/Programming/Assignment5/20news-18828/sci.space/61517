How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
be from that of the Shuttle and its OMS engines

The aperture door will be shut during reboost Using the shuttle
means that there will be someone nearby to pry the door open again 
if it should stick



I just figured if GOldin wants to really  prove out faster cheaper
better   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable
space manuevering tug  out of a BUs1  and use that for the reboost

Its clear that the whiz kids are not running the show In any
case its not prudent to stick a slapped together explosive device
on the end of a billion dollar asset that youd like to see again
Wiseacres might say that a shuttle is a slappedtogether explosive
device but at least its had some testing
