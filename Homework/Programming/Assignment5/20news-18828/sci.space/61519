Subject  FTP images ASTRO server 


I commend everybody to look at the FTP site ftpcicbfr
 Ethernet address 129201282 
in the directory pubImagesASTRO
there are lots of images all of kinds in astronomy subject
especially in GIF format and a NEW  directory of some JPL animations

For your comfort README files in all subdirectories give size and
description of each image and a 7 days newer images list is in READMENEW

Note you can connect it as anonymous or ftp user then the quota
      for each is 8 users connected in the same time
      So if the server responds you connection refused be patient 

2nd note this site is reachable by Gopher at rolandcicbfr
           Ethernet address 1292012827 
          in Divers serveurs FtpLe serveur ftp du CRICICBImagesASTRO
