Subject Re Single Launch Space Station

 the Single Launch Core Station concept  A Shuttle external tank and solid
 rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit  Shuttle
 main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
 and jettisoned after ET separation

 Why jettison the SSMEs  Why not hold on to them and have a shuttle 
 bring them down to use as spares

One performance reason comes to mind if you jettison the SSMEs you
dont have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization
burns  Onorbit SSMEs are just dead weight since we dont have an
SSME H2O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zeroG  This means
that you cant use them for reboost or anything else  Dead weight has
a couple of advantages but more disadvantages

Throwaway SSMEs might let us use some of the old SSMEs which are not
quitemanratable  But I doubt wed do that the cost of a launch
failure is too high
