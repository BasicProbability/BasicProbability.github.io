  I want to know what weightlessness actually FEELS like For example is
 there a constant sensation of falling 

Ron Baalke baalkekelvinjplnasagov replied
 Yes weightlessness does feel like falling  It may feel strange at first
 but the body does adjust  The feeling is not too different from that
 of sky diving

Im no astronaut but Ive flown in the KC135 several times  Ill
tell you about my first flight

At the onset of weightlessness my shoulders lifted and my spine
straightened  I felt a momentary panic and my hands tried to grab
onto something like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor
to prevent me from falling I remember conciously overruling my
involuntary motions  My ears felt not heard a rush and I could
feel fluid moving in my head like when you get up from bed while
you have a cold

At that point I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response
since I had some science to do  I was busy keeping my experiment
going and keeping track of all the parts during the return of
gravity and subsequent 18G pullout so I didnt really pay
attention to physiology at that time

After about 5 parabolas I discovered that I was performing one
of the tricks Ive discovered to keep myself from getting motion
sickness I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly
 all except my hands and arms which needed to be in rapid
concious motion for my experiment  During the pullout to
parabola 5 my queasiness finally started to get to me and I
had to use one of those airsickness bags  I was basically
useless for the rest of that flight so I went to the seats in
the back of the plane while my partner whom I drafted for just
this purpose kept working on the experiment while I was ill
He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider one of those anomalous
people who dont get sick on the thing

I didnt think of it as a constant sensation of falling so
much as like swimming in air  Its very close to the sensations
I feel when Im scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up

Jerry
 And what is the motion sickness
 that some astronauts occasionally experience 

Ron
 It is the bodys reaction to a strange environment  It appears to be
 induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress
 Some people are more prone to it than others like some people are more
 prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others  The mental
 part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is
 up or down ie the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay
 pointed towards Earth so the Earth or ground is above the head of
 the astronauts  About 50 of the astronauts experience some form of
 motion sickness and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to
 see how to keep the number of occurances down

Im a volunteer in JSCs Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do
among other things some of the tests Ron mentions  I was in one
called the Preflight Adaptation Trainer which consisted of a chair on
a severaldegreeoffreedom motion base with moving geometric visual
aids  The goal was to measure the victimsHHHHHHHH subjects
responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated
exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness
symptoms

I dont know of any former or activeduty astronauts who personally
read this group  I know that Bruce McCandlesss office had been
waiting anxiously for the Space Station Redesign option I posted
last week but I dont think Bruce reads the group himself
