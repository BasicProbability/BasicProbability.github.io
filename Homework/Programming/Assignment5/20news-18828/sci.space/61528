 Why not build a inflatable space dock

 If youre doing largescale satellite servicing being able to do it in
 a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense  The question is whether
 anyone is going to be doing largescale satellite servicing in the near
 future to the point of justifying development of such a thing

Thats a mighty fine idea  But since you asked Why not Ill
respond

Putting aside the application of such a space dock there are other
factors to consider than just pressurized volume  Temperature control
is difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to 
incorporate thermal insulation maybe a doublewalled inflatable
Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required
Dont think this will be a clear plastic bubble its more likely
to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multilayer
fabric that softtorso space suits are made out of today

Because almost all manned space vessels Skylab Mir Salyut used
their pressurization for increased structural rigidity even though
they had have metal skins they still kind of qualify as inflatable

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled  The
space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials due to
temperature extremes monotomic Oxygen impingement and radiation
effects on materials so your fabric may not retain any flexibility
for long  This may not matter  Even after inflation pressure
changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric which could
lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success

     Good ideas are common  whats uncommon are people wholl
      work hard enough to bring them about  Ashleigh Brilliant
