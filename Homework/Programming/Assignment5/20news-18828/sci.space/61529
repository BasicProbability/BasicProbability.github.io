2	Teflon So your eggs dont stick in the pan

Sorry to split hairs but I just read in The making of the atomic
bomb that teflon was developed during world war 2  A sealant was
needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was
gradually enriched by difussion  UF6 is very corrosive and some very
inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals

I think youre both right  Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII  From what Ive heard they had some chemical I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene in a tank and but the valve got gummed up
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized

The material was useful for seals but it had a major problem for say
the linings of vessels it wouldnt stick to metal  What the space
program did was to find a way to get it to stick  Thus we had nostick
frypans on the market in the late 60s
