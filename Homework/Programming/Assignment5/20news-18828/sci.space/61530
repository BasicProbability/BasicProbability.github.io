 Why not build a inflatable space dock

discussion of pros and cons deleted

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success

Could someone give me the references to the LLNL proposal  Ive been meaning
to track it down in conjuntion with something Im working on  Its not 
directly related to space stations but I think many of the principles will 
carry over
