Subject Re Political banner in space


Well  you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle

and most ELVs have too  far of a backlog for political messages

If during the campaign season  the candidates for president had
launched one  right around now wed  be getting a launch
for PEROT 92

and if they had used the shuttle  wed be seeing launches
for NIXON now more then ever
