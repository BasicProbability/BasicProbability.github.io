Given that what i described for the HST  seemed to be the SMT   and given
the mass amrgins on the discovery mission  is tight enough that  spacewalking
has to be carefully constrained  No EDO pallets  no spare Suits
no extra MMUs   

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this
mission  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence  


Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins
on the HST reboost mission  A while back i had asked why not carry
the EDO pallet up  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough they werent even carrying extra suits

WHy not do this

	Quick Test  Goldins philosophjy  of faster cheaper better

Build a real fast Space TUg  to handle the reboost  of the HST  using
clean Cryo fuels  and get it ready before the  HST mission

Pat this would be slower more expensive and worse  

Slower  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December  Thats less
than eight months away  There is no way you could build new hardware retrain
and reschedule the EVAs in that time


Wheres wingo when you need him

COme on   Knock that ST off

YOu forget  that during skylab  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVAs   Also during theøÄ   
Intelsat Mission   they did overnight  WETF simulations
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months

And as for building hardware  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough

YOu forget  the  BUS 1  is already built  all theyd ahve to do
is soup it up even test it  on a delta mission

Dont get into this mode of  negativism   besides  at the rate
missions slip   the Discovery wont launch on this mission until
March  thats almost a year

More Expensive  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS  In addition youve added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware


Ah  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission

YOu forget  there is a bum FGS  the Solar array electronics are
getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission

The time for the space walks are growing rapidly  THis was orignally
planned out as 3 spacewalks  now they are at 5 EVAs  with 3 reserve
walks

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission thats 500 million
saved  If the Weight savings  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days
and  handle any contingency  problems  thats quite a savings


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle  HST and
AXAF  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle
there doesnt seem to be any need for your vehicle


Of course  there wasnt any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too

as for the problems with the aperture door  I am sure they can
work out some way to handle  that  Maybe a Plug  made from
Frozen ice   itll keep out any contamination
yet sublime away  after teh boost
