 design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missionsnamely different planets

Not useful unless youve got some truly wonderful propulsion system for
the mother ship that cant be applied to the probes  Otherwise its
better to simply launch the probes independently  The outer planets
are scattered widely across a twodimensional solar system and going
to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one  Uranus is not on
the way to Neptune  Dont judge interplanetary trajectories in general
by what the Voyagers did  they exploited a lineup that occurs only
every couple of centuries and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect
route to Neptune

Also the mother ship would be powered if not the Mars Mission by a normal
propulsion but also a solar sail 

Solar sails are pretty useless in the outer solar system  Theyre also
very slow unless you assume quite advanced versions
