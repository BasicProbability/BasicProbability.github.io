No the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch  Indeed this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be
retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed
to the arrayflapping problems
 
 
Why not design the solar arrays to be detachable  if the shuttle is going
to retunr the HST  what bother are some arrays  just fit them with a quick release
 
I didnt think the bistem design was used so much for the retrieval as
for the ability to launch in a tight size STS envelope  This is my own 
guess based on similar designs flown on other large STSlaunched sc 
GRO UARS  Also there might be some consideration given to mass 
requirements bistems weight less than conventional SA  Finally 
the HST arrays do have the ability to be detachedremember theyre 
going to be replaced with new arrays

However as an ACS guy whos seen his branch management pull their
collective hair out over HST I would voice a hearty yea to using
conventional arrays over bistems whenever possible  No half hertz
flexible modes no thermal snap no problem
