 How much energy does a burster put out  I know energy depends on
 distance which is unknown  An answer of the form X ergs per
 megaparsec2 is OK
 
different spheres R25pcOort Cloud Radius R225pcat the edge of the
galaxy R1835pc or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a
R8800Mpc  
        For a radius of 25 pc we found an L around 1032 ergsec  Pretty
energetic for close by  for the coronal model we found around 1043 ergsec
And lastly for the cosmological model an L1053 Thats what youd call
moderately energetic Id say  Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second

Supernovae put out 1053 or 1054 i forget which but its only an
order of magnitude  Not in gamma rays though  Youd hafta get
all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc but if a decent fraction
of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic 
but closer than 9 Mpc  I dunno SN theory so well but I cant think
of how to get many gammas out  Maybe I should look it up

Big radio galaxies can put out 1046 ergs continually  Thats just
in the radio there are a lot of gammas around them too but bursts
Nah

Neither of these should be taken as explanations just trying to show
that those energies are produced by things we know about
