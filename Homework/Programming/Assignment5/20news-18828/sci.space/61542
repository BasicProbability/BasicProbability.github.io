Subject Re Mothership for Flybys and cutting costs

In article C6DtD0HHIzootorontoedu henryzootorontoedu Henry Spencer writes
by what the Voyagers did  they exploited a lineup that occurs only
every couple of centuries and even so Voyager 2 took a rather indirect
route to Neptune

Indirect compared to what  Did Voyager 2 traverse a substantially greater
distance than say a Hohmann orbit  Ive never heard Voyagers path
described as indirect before
