   What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away

 Given the enormous  power  i was just wondering  what if they are
 quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by

 Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges

   David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic
edged distribution to whit they are either part of the Universe or
part of the Oort cloud

I dont know what you mean by edged but surely there are two other
possibilities for an isotropic distribution near interstellar up to
100 pc ie within the disc or the Galaxys corona

Why couldnt they be Earth centred with the edge occuring at the edge
of the gravisphere I know there isnt any mechanism for them but there
isnt a mechanism for the others either

has the best claim but a sizeable minority support Pluto exGod of the
Dead on the grounds that he has a really sick sense of humour Tom Holt
