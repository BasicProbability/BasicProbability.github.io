Given that what i described for the HST  seemed to be the SMT  

Has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this
mission  You seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence  

Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins
on the HST reboost mission  A while back i had asked why not carry
the EDO pallet up  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough
they werent even carrying extra suits

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS  Thats the critical question
My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10900 kg of propellant  Of that a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn the reentry
burn and the reserve  So Pat tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
going to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS1 and extra parts are going
mass  If you can make the numbers work out then Ill be interested  After
you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the EDO pallet BUS1
and extra equipment is going to cost  

WHy not do this

	Quick Test  Goldins philosophjy  of faster cheaper better

Build a real fast Space TUg  to handle the reboost  of the HST  using
clean Cryo fuels  and get it ready before the  HST mission

Pat this would be slower more expensive and worse  

Wheres wingo when you need him
COme on   Knock that ST off

YOu forget  that during skylab  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVAs   Also during thexD   
Intelsat Mission   they did overnight  WETF simulations
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months

First while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning that was
because they had to  They dont like to do that as a general rule

Second remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6  They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasnt designed to do that  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely

Third they dont have eight months  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it approved
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude  I think its realistic  Im not
saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are  
What Im saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management

And as for building hardware  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough

YOu forget  the  BUS 1  is already built  all theyd ahve to do
is soup it up even test it  on a delta mission

All they have to do is soup it up  Just what does that mean  

Dont get into this mode of  negativism   besides  at the rate
missions slip   the Discovery wont launch on this mission until
March  thats almost a year

More Expensive  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
was going to do execpt fire the OMS  In addition youve added significant
extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware

Ah  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission

The second servicing mission is a contingency  You have neither shown that it
would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your
plan  

YOu forget  there is a bum FGS  the Solar array electronics are
getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission

No Pat I havent forgotten

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission thats 500 million
saved

No Pat  Thats 500 million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost
of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement 
costs minus extra operating costs  TANSTAAFL

According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me there are
only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle  HST and
AXAF  Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle
there doesnt seem to be any need for your vehicle

Of course  there wasnt any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too

Im sure that if you reread this youll see that your argument is falacious

as for the problems with the aperture door  I am sure they can
work out some way to handle  that  Maybe a Plug  made from
Frozen ice   itll keep out any contamination
yet sublime away  after teh boost

Pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device thats made to 
perform this task it also ignores the point  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open something can be done
about it  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door
you havent solved the problem
