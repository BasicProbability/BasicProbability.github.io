 Getting wierd again
 
 Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts Kind of liek the old
 MIRV principle of old Cold War Days 
 Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
 different missionsnamely different planets Each probe would be tied in with
 the mother ship or earth as the case may be This is good when and if we go
 for Mars the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the
 probes

I cant see the need for a single big expensive heavy mothership except
for Voyager style flyby missions A few years ago I did some calculations on a
Grand Tour space probe launched by a Saturn V in 197576 At the timeI felt 
that
the idea of a big mother ship had some merit  the Voyagers had to be rather
small lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan
IIICentaur launchers The concept I examined and Michaels had a lot in
common with the British Interplanetary Societys Daedalus project for sending a
probe to Barnards Star  ie a large bus spacecraft carrying several
smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination
The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10ton payload towards
Jupiter and beyond The bus could have included far more powerful
camerastelescopesscientific equipment and a heaviermore powerful power
source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore
Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements
within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter and usually at a
relatively great distance

The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the real Voyagers
and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in
the early 21st century and would have been released at various points during
the mission The advantages are obvious the bus would have carried out the
same basic JupiterSaturnUranusNeptune mission than Voyager 2 did but in
addition two subprobes could have been relased at Saturn examining
that planets south polar regions before moving on to Pluto This would have
enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of PlutoCharon by 1986and several
other probes could have examined parts of the JupiterSaturnUranusNeptune
systems that werent examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to
trajectoryrelated factors A small swarm of cameraequipped miniature space
probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a 
small Voyagertype mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy 
wellequipped spacecraft And would we have learned a lot more about the outer
planets The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money of
course
