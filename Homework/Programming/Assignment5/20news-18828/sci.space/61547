I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range
of physical aspects of the planet  The question is what physical aspects
simply disallow earth like conditions

    Dandridge Cole and Isaac Asimov collaborated on a book titled
 Habitable Planets for Man I think in 1964  It should be available
 in most good libraries or through interlibrary loan

Some more references

The first paper includes a detailed discussion of the physical conditions
for habitability
