Habital planets are also dependent on what kind of plant life can be grown
and such Length of growing season that is if you want something more than
VAT food argh Id ratehr eat an MRE for  along period of time

Using greenhouses to extend the growing season shouldnt be a problem
Im supprised they dont do so in Alaska cheaper to import perhaps

Incans and Sherpa and other low pressure atmosphere and such are a limit in
human adaptabilitysomeone mentioend that Incan woman must come to lower
elevations to have babies brought to term true

No the Incas had no problems with this but the Spanish did
