Subject Re Mothership for Flybys and cutting costs

In a recent article nsmcaauroraalaskaedu writes
Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large 
and to expensive

Id hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal too large if the
new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds the SC mass will
drop to 110120 kg or too expensive 400 million FY92  for two SC
especially when compared to other NASA planetary missions

Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
different missionsnamely different planets Each probe would be tied in with
the mother ship or earth as the case may be This is good when and if we go
for Mars the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for 
the probes

This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and
the require minimal deltav from the mother ship  A mission to the main belt
might be one possibility for such a mission  I recall a paper being presented
at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed
spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin I think  Four
minispacecraft would detatch from the main SC each visiting a seperate
asteroid and then returning to the main SC  After analysis the main SC
would then be targeted for the most interesting object for further study

Now if I could only find that paper
