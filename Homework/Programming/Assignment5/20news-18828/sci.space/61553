Its interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects
GANTT charts CPM and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors  The construction industry


Of course

	How many government projects after Using PERT GANT CPMs
Process flow diagrams  Level 5 software projects  actually
come in on schedule and under Cost  I know the GAO determined
that 80 of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing
to adequately measure  engineering developement costs   

Me I am allin favor of Government RD  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research   I dont think the government should pour money
into any one sector  but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art  

THings like  High tech  construction projects  apollo  was worth it for the doing  Running hte national labs  The SSC is grossly overweight  but
is a reasonable project at a lower cost  

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected

Maybe what they should do is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PHds  you get a 1 time grant of 5000000   If you produce you
can  qualify for other grants  If you dont  you never get in again

THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach  and older  stale 
scientists dont dominate the process
