 Also as implied by other posters why 
do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway 
You dont need to but its desirable  HST like all satellites in
low Earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag  It was
deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason
It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter  It has
no propulsion system of its own

Has any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the HST yet
Give it a push  I can see the push start cartoons now
