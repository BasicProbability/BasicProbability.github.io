My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10900 kg of propellant  Of that a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn the reentry
burn and the reserve  So Pat tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
going to take and how much the EDO pallet BUS1 and extra parts are going
mass  If you can make the numbers work out then Ill be interested  After
you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the EDO pallet BUS1
and extra equipment is going to cost  


I dont know  Does anyone in NASA land know how much fuel is
budgeted for the altitude change

Henry  any figures on the mass  full  for the EDO pallet  plus
its dry weight  How about for the dry mass of Bus1  it was
being declassified as i checked last

Also I need

1  current orbital parameters of HST 

2  projected  orbital parameters after reboost

3  Discoverys  DRY weight

4 HSTs Dry weight


I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months

First while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning that was
because they had to  They dont like to do that as a general rule


So how long do they need to train  a year  2 years  somehow
I think 23 moths should be adequate

Second remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6  They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasnt designed to do that  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely


Also because they significantly lacked onorbit EVA experience  
The HST is designed for onorbit servicing  it should be a lot easier

Third they dont have eight months  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it approved
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude  I think its realistic  Im not
saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are  
What Im saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management


There comes a time in every project to kill the management

They can if neccessary reschedule the  HST mission  December is
not a drop dead date unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission  



All they have to do is soup it up  Just what does that mean  


I suspect the BUS1 may not have enough basic thrust for the HST
reboost  it mayu need bigger tanks  or bigger thrusters


My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not
a contingency  My understanding is the mission  needs both
a new FOC  and work on the electrical system  plus
another reboost   


If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission thats 500 million
saved

No Pat  Thats 500 million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost
of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement 
costs minus extra operating costs  TANSTAAFL


Somehow i think the cost of an expendable SMT will be less then
500 million

and the extra stuff is real cheap  NASA has lots of suits  MMUs
and the EDO pallets are reusable  Oh one double magnum of champagne
now theres a couple hundred bucks





Pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device thats made to 
perform this task it also ignores the point  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open something can be done
about it  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door
you havent solved the problem


That door has cycled X times already  Once after massive G loading
I somehow think they can work oureliability  methods to ensure the
door works

Also  please tell me how some sort of sublimated  material  like
CO2 or H2O  would manage to contaminate the mirror  anything
that goes to vapor state shouldnt adhere to the mirror

somehow the door  problem can be worked  maybe they can put a one
time spring on it

what do they do now if the door hangs up  that door is part
of a intrument safing mechanism  if it hangs up tomorrow  itll
be 8 months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it
