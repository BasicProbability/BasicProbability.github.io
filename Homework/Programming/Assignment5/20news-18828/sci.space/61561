How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
be from that of the Shuttle and its OMS engines
 
 The aperture door will be shut during reboost Using the shuttle
 means that there will be someone nearby to pry the door open again 
 if it should stick
 

Well no during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was
not opened until after the Shuttle had landed  

I presume that during a reboost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter
with the orbiter bay doors shut but still there would be lots of contamination
worries  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to 
keep clean

But I still dont know where the idea is coming from that HST NEEDS a
reboost  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them  There
is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in
December
