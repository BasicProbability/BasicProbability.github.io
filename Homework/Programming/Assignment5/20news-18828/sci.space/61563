Subject Re HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost
and you dont want to clip off the panels each time

The artist renderings that Ive seen of the HST reboost still have
the arrays fully extended with a cradle holding HST at a 30 degree
angle to the Shuttle  I think the rendering was conceived before the
array replacemnet was approved so Im not sure if the current reboost
will occur with the arrays deployed or not  However it doesnt 
appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost
 
For the GammaRay Observatory one of the design requirements was that
there be no storedenergy mecahnisms springs explosive squibs gas shocks
etc used for deployment  This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay and partially for
safety considerations  Ive heard that the wings on a cruise missile
would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened
 

Thanks for the input on GROs SA design constraints  That would 
explain the similar design on UARS

Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to
orbit of 395 per pound  everybody designed things for easy servicing
 

Heck the MMS project used to design missions with servicing in mind
The XTE spacecraft was originally designed as an onorbit replacement
for the instrument module on EUVE  That way you get two instruments
for the price of one spacecraft bus the Explorer Platform  A 
second onorbit replacement was also considered with the FUSE telescope
