 No  A dragless satellite does not magically have no drag it burns fuel
 constantly to fight drag maintaining the exact orbit it would have if
 there was no drag  

     Well almost It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earths gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years 

A harmonic of the Earths gravitational field  What IS a harmonic of the
Earths gravitational field

     My favorite example of this is the SovietRussian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class which are in 141 resonance In 

141 resonance with WHAT  Its not like theres any wavelength or frequency
to the Earths gravitational field  Now there might be some interesting
interactions with the Moons tidal effectis that what youre talking about

    This probably has little relevance to space stations since the 71 
degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms But 
its kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation 

What are the physics of the situation  The only way I can see gravitational
effects being useful in adding energy to an object orbiting Earth is some
sort of interaction with the moon
