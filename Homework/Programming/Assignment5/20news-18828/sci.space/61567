Thats fine idea but it only works if the lightingpower company even bothers to supply good light fixtures  For instance a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type  Yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell

Uh why do they have to ask a state commision Unless the states buying

Such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company
of selling different types of light and will decreace the likleihood
that they will do so And any efficient lights they might have been
planning in the future go down the drain

were bad designs  one that wasted the light  Thus you couldnt even buy
a good light from them  In most places to get a good light you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona

You could order it special If enough people did so it would be 
low cost Last I checked you could use UPS to buy stuff in Arizona
before going there

Finally Im sure your state has things like small factories and
machine shops You could go into business making lights that are
cheaper to use thanks to their higher efficiency and the
fact that they arent wasting energy on broadcasting to space
and therefore better than the old style

  At some
point society starts to make rules  Cars have to pass safety tests

Five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy
will fall apart
  
Companies have to meet pollution standards etc

As if the clean air act really cleaned up the air

  There are two ways to achieve this  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work

MY experience seems to suggest that youre trying too hard
to educate them with the same methods used in American schools
to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as ProtoUgric
instead of selling them on the idea


Agreed so I wont respond again  Its important for all you spacers out 
there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that 
have been presented  Just like Congress it would be best to consult
the astronomerslovers of the night sky before you try some PR stunt
to boost public knowledge about space

Well wake up Space is becoming a field of human endeavor
instead of just something we can look at from a long long
way away There are practical space projects that could conceivably
although probably not cause lots of light pollution and 
have been argued against on those grounds even though they
might open up such possibilities that people could vacation on
Mars if they wanted really dark skies
