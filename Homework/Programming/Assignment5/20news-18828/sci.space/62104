Rockwell International in Downey California in conjunction with the
other shuttle contractors delivered the worlds most important and
most revolutionary space vehicle

Ha

One cannot argue with the fact that
it flies lands and is reusable 

Watch me It flies It lands It gets rebuilt


In my opinion these were the only
appropriate specifications for this program

Thats not what they told us back in the 70s

It has been a test program from the start a logical follow to the
X15 program and the later Xseries lifting bodies

1 It isnt a logical followon A logical followon would have
been either a Russian snowfox type thingey for the lifting bodies
or something like MMIs Space Van or Boeings TSTO or the airbreathing
TSTO the military is allegedly using now that probably cost less
to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year

The engineering specs that the guys in the trenches had were to
develop a system which was manratable could land reliably and could
be reflown  These goals were quite visionary for the 1970s and I
would argue that they are challenging even today including for the
DCX program

Keep that attitude and itll be a couple centuries before we get real
access to space unless another country without all that baggage comes
along and kicks our ass in the space race

I do not recall a 1 flightweek specification in the final NASA specs for the
space shuttle program  If you have such documents I would find them most
revealing and interesting  As far as I can tell the only people touting a 
1 flight per week flight rate were people on Capitol Hill or selling books 
to the general public  

Or NASA HQ That doesnt give the rest of the program plausible deniability
if we deceide that it wasnt worth the money weve spent which is by now
probably a lot more than Apollo

IMHO political statements in the halls of the US Congress are not
admissable as engineering specs because specs should be determined by
NASADOD and contractors not by Congressmen Senators or Presidents
Missions are defined by political leaders but not the engineering
specs

Yes but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements
Youre saying basically that it met the engineering specs which is
questionable IMHO so its a success never mind that you couldnt
get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in
a thousand years

The shuttle is the only reusable space vehicle  This automatically
qualifies it as an unparalleled engineering success  You could argue
about its political success  But engineering wise it is clearly the
most advanced machine ever flown  I argue that engineering and
technical data for hypersonic flight is valuable in and of itself
Shuttle should be justified or criticized on the basis of economics

You can get hypersonic flight data with an X15 or a followon X15
type vehicle for much less

And economics and engineering are interchangable engineering in the
absense of economics is basically just physics and in terms of physics
the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X15


Then Henry wrote

HSSorry support that I can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers
HSthat I have some hope of riding some day  At the moment thats
HSDCXs hopedfor successors

I was disappointed by this and other similar statements from those vocal in 
support of the DCX program   Your support of DCX is based on hopes
My support for the shuttle program is based on record 

The shuttle program has a bad record I once had hopes for the
shuttle program By now I know those hopes were false 

All I have for DCX and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles
are hopes But at least I know they arent false hopes yet

I did support the shuttle way back when It didnt do nearly what
it was supposed to Its time to move on to something that might do
the job of orbital delivery better Or at all


I think that it is 
also important to note that I do not object to DCX  It is visionary  
I originally posted

 I like the DCX idea  and I am really hopeful that itll be a stunning success 

Unfortunately DCXers are not willing to return that support the
proven Shuttle program  Explain why you folks criticize shuttle when
shuttle is exactly what you guys need in order to learn how to operate
DCX onorbit

We dont want to learn how to operate on orbit It launches it
shoves out the payload it lands It doesnt waste payload hauling
up and down EDO pallets and the like

The only thing to be learned from shuttle is how not to build a
launcher

Finally that bit about the proven shuttle Are you hoping you can
tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it

I enjoyed your later postings regarding the comparisons between the shuttle
and the Soyuz project  Although I may disagree with your method
of analysis  You probably will disagree with mine 8  I think that
the total impact of the shuttle program must be judged on the scientific and
technical merit not on timelines and schedules do you agree 

How much science and technology could have been done is the money spent
on shuttle had been spent differently


As for now we need to stop thinking of DCX and shuttle as mutually exclusive

Learn about economics and the current budget realities in the United States
please

Thanks for your time
