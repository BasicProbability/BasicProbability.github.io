  Its seems a bit scarry to me that such a project which for the first
time in years promisses some hope in changing the current trend in
massively overpriced boosting capability lacks much publicity

The people involved in it have been building hardware rather than writing
press releases  This is not a highmanpower project they dont have
spare people sitting around

As I understand it there has also been some feeling on the part of some
of the project management that publicity was not a good idea  A lot of
people have been working on changing this view with some success
