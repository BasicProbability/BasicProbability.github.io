I cant speak for the Russian probes but the last I heard the 1997 US
probe is planned to have airbags on it seriously to cushion the
impact  Hopefully it wont be a bouncer should just hit and go
thud

The JPLSan Gabriel AIAA session last week showed the Russian
lander encased in a single large airbag with ravelable stitches
The Russian design is pretty firm and hardware is due from
international experimenters by 194
The proposed 1997 American lander has a bunch of airbags shaped
like a bunch of grapes  They were dropping it in the desert last
month  It may have a 20 kg minirover in it
