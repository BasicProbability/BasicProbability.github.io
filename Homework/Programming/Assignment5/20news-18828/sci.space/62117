Ken

Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big
Boys if youre tackling Henry  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in
on the subject of staggering operational costs too  Good luck son

In article 1sp513beohscuscedu khayashhscuscedu Ken Hayashida writes
Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences
and medical related packages  

Ahem  The Russians are in the Free World now or at least it would be
Politically Correct to contend so

I am hopeful that DCX  or whatever the followon is eventually called 
will perform as you state  But right now I must admit that I am more 
skeptical than ever  

It will be tough to make DCX succeed and to turn it into an
operational orbital vehicle  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of
the promised goals  The reason people are so fond of it is that its
the only chance we have now or will have for a long time to come
to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs  

There is no Shuttle successor in funded development NASP is dwindling
away and ALSNLSSpacelifter sure as hell arent gonna knock any
zeroes off that 20003000 per pound cost   Part of the blame for
this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual
billions of the er Free Worlds available space cash  As you will
no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come 

DCX is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping
development costs low and flying incremental Xplane hardware
Its been to my mind incredibly successful already theyve built a
complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks  I would
have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s
America never mind flying the thing getting a successor funded or
building the DCY

Im sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any
expansion of astronautics  I dont see a realistic  prospect for
beating down those costs for multiton payloads anywhere else  If
the DC flops itll be business as usual in space  The Nineties and
the DoubleOughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties a
prospect too depressing to bear

Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different
direction  It doesnt lower costperpound but it offers an orbital
launch for under ten megabucks  Its creating its own market for
small payloads

I read the magazines and Ive attended the last two IAFs There are
plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems some
of them as good as or better than SSTO  There is no sign in todays
world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an
assembly line

You could change my view on DCX if you could prove the following
deleting some things Im not going to prove tonight
3  that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a manratable
DCX successor

Strawman  Is anybody seriously proposing this  References please 
The DC must be developed in the realworld funding climate which
includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle
operations as well as the bird in the hand argument your common
sense tells you   If DCY flies at all it flies alongside the
Shuttle not instead of it

Also of course DCY and its operational descendants will be useful
for a wide variety of jobs even if they are not manrated

4  Most importantly that the DCX will open up LEO to more scientific and
technical payloads

If a DCX successor can fly a 10000kg payload for 1M or even 5M
rather than the 40M it now costs more people will be able to afford
more payloads for the same money you can fly several satellites
instead of one  Big outfits can fly multisatellite series  Little
outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of
begging a ride  This is just supply and demand  You should be able
to convince yourself that point 4 will be true assuming DC makes a
big difference in costs  Do you have some reason to think not
