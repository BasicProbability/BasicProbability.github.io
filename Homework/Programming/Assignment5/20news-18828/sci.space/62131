Im not sure which amazes me more the fact that someone would go to all this
trouble to write about McElwaine or the fact that someone would post something
which repeatedly says it shouldnt be posted

Its all moot anyway  He had is net access privileges revoked last week

McElwaine got his access revoked  Finally

And they say it couldnt be done  If we can rid the net of McElwaine
then anything is possible
