Well Spenzwhat can I say 8
Youve attacked my beloved vehicle 

If I may offer a constructive criticism perhaps you should decide if you
love vehicles or the use they are put to I myself think the F86 is
a beautiful aircraft but rest assured I wouldnt even think of flying
it in combat today Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform

We see zerodefects operation in many areas of life  

Not to this degree

Calling shuttle flight characteristics bizarre in the same post 
as touting DCX is interesting  

Why

DCX will also have similar zerodefects issues am I wrong  

Your wrong The DC approach is very tollerent of failure It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature Shuttle
isnt reusable its salvagable

I am thinking of how DCX will deploy a chute or reverse orientation at 
supersonic speeds  

The flip over happens at a very low speed not supersonic If the DCX
shows the flip over works it will work unless the laws of physics change

How much in DCX is redundant  Thats the real question

The final DC1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop Upon reentry for example it can loose about 80 of available
thrust and still land safely

Everything we do in life has zerodefects issues at times agree

Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but thats not the same
thing Shuttle simply isnt a fault tolerent design SSTO is

As a doctor I can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations  

You dont put your patients in conditions where there is no way out You
wouldnt for example give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you

While DCXs RD program makes good sense I am less optimistic about DCX 
as you and apparently others are  

You are very much in the minority If the DC series fails to make orbit it
will still be a very worthwhile effort It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO

But DCX will still have failures  It is the nature of aerospace RD  

Again refering to the DC1 it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop Shuttle doesnt DC is fault tollerent Shuttle isnt

Its successors are not slated to be passenger carrying  

Not true Build a passenger pallet a fairly easy thing to do and it will
carry passengers

The impression I had
when I visited MacDac Huntington Beachs Open House was that the payload space
was limited and the manratable version was decades away

I would suggest you talk to the DCX crew themselves Their original
schedule had an operational DC1 flying in 96

Shuttle is the only method in the free world of orbiting large life sciences
and medical related packages  As for now it is our only ticket into space 
and has my support

Your ignoring the dammage it does Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it

You could change my view on DCX if you could prove the following

The only way to prove those things is to build it
