Subject Re DCX and publicity is there any

  Its seems a bit scarry to me that such a project which for the first
time in years promisses some hope in changing the current trend in
massively overpriced boosting capability lacks much publicity

That may change next month at least I hope it will A couple of hundred
journalists have requested press passes for the test flights Sustaining
that publicity however will be a problem
