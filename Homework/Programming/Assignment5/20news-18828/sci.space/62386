The most revealing comparison between Shuttle and Soyuz is cost All
other comparisons are apples and oranges

I like this statement though for my own reasons  Cost comparisons depend
a lot on whether the two options are similar and then it becomes very
revealing to consider what their differences are  Can Soyuz launch the
Long Exposure Facility  Course not  Will the Shuttle take my television 
relay to LEO by years end  Almost certainly not but the Russians are
pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule

Comparing S and SS points up that there are TWO active space
launcherandworkplatform resources with similarities and differences
Where they are in direct competition we may get to see some market
economics come into play
