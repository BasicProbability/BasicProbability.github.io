This reverse the polarity crap always bugged the hell out of me too
until I found an actual live reallife example of it working I quote
from Aviation Week and Space Technology for 2 July 1990 page 25

	He Colonel Charles F Stirling speaking of the problem of
	fuel bubble formation in Titan 4 Aerojet LR87 engines said
	engineers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory had run into
	the same problem and suggested that the Air Force look at the
	effect of Aerozene 50 decomposition The fix now flown three
	times without incident was to reverse the inlet and outlet
	portions of the hot gas cooler

 Once again life imitates art 

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment  Ran forward
it would suck energy from the Earths magnetic field while trivially
slowing the Shuttle  It could also have run backward  if they ran 
electricity through the tether the other way it would have trivially
propelled the Shuttle faster

But an even better example comes to mind  Theres this electronics guy
someone like Craig Anderton or Don Lancaster  Ten years ago he wrote about
an invention of his  He could take a lightdetector run current through
it at about a hundred times its rating and it would glow  He got legal
rights to this design of a combination fiber optic emitterreceiver  This
turned out to be the basic unit of ATTs  I think plan to bring Brazils
communications system into the 21st century  The article was mostly about
his legal wranglings with the company that eventually got him wellcompensated
for his invention
