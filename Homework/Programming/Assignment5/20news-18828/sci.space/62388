Subject Re Who is Henry Spencer anyway

Someone named Hansk asked about pictures

Well there is an archive of portraits in xfaces format at
ftpuunet Henry Spencers picture is there somewhere along
with several thousand others

I dont remember the path though it should be easy to find
Remember though it seems to use both internet and uucp
addresses
