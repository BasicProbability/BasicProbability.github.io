My god  You dare posting  I posed these very questions to Mr Spencer 
some time ago by email  Unfortunately I never received any response

Apologies  Your mail is probably in the pile that arrived just before
I got sick about a month ago  A reply will appear eventually

Now what I really would like to see is an interview with Mr Spencer A
magazine photograph or even better a tv program No I want both

So far there have been none unless you count an interview in The Amateur
Computerist about the history of netnews which may be disqualified because
TACs budget doesnt run to reproducing photos
