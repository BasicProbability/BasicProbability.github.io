Hans As somebody replied on whether the space shuttle is connected to
Hans Usenet No Of course the main flow of information would be up
Hans unless Henry Spencer would be aboard in which case the main
Hans flow of information would be down

Gene Miya says that Henry will never go aloft in the Shuttle the
payload bay isnt big enough for his chocolate chip cookies

When Henry was here at Dryden he was looking pretty covetously at the
SR71s and the F104s even though they dont have much cookie space
I guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight
