When I do programs I spend
about half the time talking about absitinence 
I find that most people who object
to sex education actually object to the teaching anything other than
abstinencne and that IMO is just as irresponsible as only talking
about comdom use

Im under the impression that most sex ed instructors andor policy makers
actually object to making any more than a passing reference to abstinence
wishing to spend time only on the realistic choices 

In the sex ed portion of the  high school health course I took
in 1984 it was impressed that the only 100 positive way to not
get pregnant was to not have sex

Other methods of contraception were discussed in the framework of
a chart which showed both the expected failure rate theoretical
assumes no mistakes and the actual failure rate based on research
Top of the chart was something like this


 Method                  Expected         Actual 
                  Failure Rate    Failure Rate
 Abstinence                 0              0 


And NFP Natural Family Planning was on the bottom The teacher even
said Ive had some students tell me that they cant use anything for
birth control because theyre Catholic Well if youre not married and
youre a practicing Catholic the top of the list is your slot not 
the bottom  Even if youre not religious the top of the list is
safest

Yes this was a public school and after Dr Koops failing abstinence
use a condom statement on the prevention of AIDS
