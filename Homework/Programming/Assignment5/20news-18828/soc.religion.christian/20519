    These figures dont seem to take account of rape Or is a woman who
is raped considered not to have been abstaining

I no longer have the textbook but abstinence was defined as something
like no contact between the penis and the vagina vulva or area 
immediately surrounding the vulva and no transfer of semen to the
vagina vulva or area surrounding the vulva  

That is abstinence wasnt discussed as sex outside of marriage is
morally wrong but as keep  the sperm away from the ovum and conception 
is impossible The moral question I recall the teacher asking was
is it okay to create a child if you arent able to be a good parent
yet
