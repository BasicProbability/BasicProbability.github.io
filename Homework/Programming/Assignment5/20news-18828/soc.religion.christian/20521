Subject Re Hell

Quoth the Moderator

I have to say that I some qualms about giving you this explanation
because it raises additional problems If God is the source of all
existence then a complete separation from him would make existence
itself impossible  So does God maintain just enough connection with
those who are rejected to keep them in existence so he can punish
them

In a short poem God in His mercy made  the fixed pains of Hell
C S Lewis expresses an idea that Im sure was current among others
but I havent be able to find its source

that even Hell is an expression of mercy because God limits the amount
of separation from Him and hence the amount of agony that one can
achieve
