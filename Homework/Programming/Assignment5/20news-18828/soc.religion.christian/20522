From mcovingtaisun3aiugaedu Michael Covington
Subject Re DID HE REALLY RISE

The two historic facts that I think the most important are these

1 If Jesus didnt rise from the dead then he must have done something
else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact

2 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the
Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
it would have discredited the Christians
