Well my son the best advice I can give you is this Eat a lot of
carrots
Oh do you really think that will work  And should it be before or
after intercourse
INSTEAD my son INSTEAD

Disclaimer As a single Catholic I didnt have any business to post this
kind of joke to this group so if you found it inappropriate 

But what was wrong with it  It wont tempt anyone to any kind of sin as
far as I can tell  It doesnt belittle anyone  It does not substitute
offensiveness for humor its genuinely funny

We shouldnt assume that all jokes that mention sexuality are dirty
merely because so many are

And we should never mistake prudery for spirituality  It can be the direct
opposite  a symptom of the lack of a healthy perspective on Gods
creation
