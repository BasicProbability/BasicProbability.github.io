 In Quebec French the word for the celebration of the resurrection is
 Paquesthis is etymologically related to Pesach Passover and the
 pascal lamb  So is the French Canadian mostly Roman Catholic celebration
 better because it uses the right name

I was at my parents Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the 
packages was English Hebrew and French  In the phrase kosher for 
passover the French word used was Paques   Weve deliberately 
mistranslated this at the Kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods 
being kosher for Easter 

however the word paques in french is the word for easter  ask
any francophone whether from quebec or from paris  besides havent
you heard of the phrase the paschal lamb meaning jesus

sorry to nitpick on the more trivial part of this thread
