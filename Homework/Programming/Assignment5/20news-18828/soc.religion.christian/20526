I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately liturgy in particular Catholic liturgy  In the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass  Its
driving me crazy  The most gracefilled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how 
to do it  Led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to God  But the best Masses Ive been to were participatory prayers

    

Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the
Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting
their rosary beads during Mass I find this comment interesting  There
is a massively longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts
without active participation  If you know the Latin one really
beautiful way to hear the Passion is its being chanted by three
deacons  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range Jesus chants
in the bass and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor
This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion
that John would prefer

But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations
Each pastor makes his own decisions it isnt a churchwide conspiracy
against participation  The Palm Sunday liturgy with its initial
blessing and distribution of the palms and procession is already
getting long before you get to the Passion some pastors feel that they
should not make the people stand through that long narrative  Also the
orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation
in the crowd quotations runs longer than the singlereader proclamation
 in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday it might be
necessary to go with the briefer options just to get em in and get em
out

Each parish is different  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to
their geographic parishes  It is possible that another Catholic parish
in the Columbus area based on the Ohio State address has a liturgy
closer to your preferences  Or talk to some of your fellow
parishioners and see how common your preferences are  pastors
generally ARE willing to listen to nonconfrontational requests  Though
you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly
to the shock of people asked for a longer Sunday Mass

Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasnt follow
the continuous evolution model the accumulation of small changes no
single one of which is too hard to take but rather the punctuated
equilibrium model things stay the same and we get accustomed to them
then the marked mutation hits  My apologies if I am misremembering
the names of the evolutionary theories
