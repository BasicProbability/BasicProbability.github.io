There had been recent criticism of this in a listserv for academic
Biblical scholars they all say the books are modern fakes

Which listsev was this and is the discussion still current  My questioning
is based on some information presented from the Essene NT that challenges
some of my eating choices  As the info came from a biased opposed to my
preferences third party I am looking for info as to whether I should
dismiss this work or put some consideration into it  Thanks again for info
