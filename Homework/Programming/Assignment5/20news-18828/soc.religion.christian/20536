After all what does prophesy mean  Secondly what is an Apostle  Answer
an especial witnessone who is suppose to be a personal witness  That means
to be a true apostle one must have Christ appear to them  Now lets see
when did the church quit claiming 

Actually an apostle is someone who is sent  If you will mailmen could
be called apostles in that sense  However with Jesus they were
designated and were given power  Remember that there were many
thousands of people who witnessed what Jesus did  That didnt make them
apostles though
