Subject Re Revelations

He doesnt contradict himself  The church is to last for all time
However there are those who use the church to bolster themselves  This
is evident in many letters  For instance Paul talks about the
superapostles to the Corinthians 2 Corinthians 1112 he mentions
how people will be led away by miracles signs and wonders 2
Thessalonians 2912 he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will
abandon the faith and teach lies 1 Timothy 413 and that some will
search for teachers to suit what they want to hear 2 Timothy 434
Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them
Matthew 24414  But look at the promise in this last part  Verse
14  And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world
as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come  Even today
there are false teachings  I can name two which I am well familiar
with  the nonneed of baptism and the praying of Jesus into your life
for salvation  Both are taught  Both are DEAD wrong  They have been
taken out of context from some verses interpreted from others and just
plain made up  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 92326 and
Luke 142533  He then commands baptism in Matthew 281820  The
church Jesus founded though is alive and well  Its not being
persecuted as much as back then the laws wont allow it yet but it is
being persecuted
