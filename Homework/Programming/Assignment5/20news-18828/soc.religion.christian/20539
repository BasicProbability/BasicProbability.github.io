Subject Re Sin

Sorry for taking this off of Sharons resp but Id also like to add
some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second Q

Verses
   1 Corinthians 6910
   Colossians 3510

As for knowing when thats a bit tricky  People normally have
consciences which warn them about it  However as in my case a
conscience can be hardened by sins deceitfulness Hebrews 31213 so
that the person has no idea or doesnt care about it that they are
sinning  Of course there are those sins which we do when we dont know
that theyre sinful to begin with  Those take searching and examining
of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and
change  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful
possibilities is  Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in
time  I know it sounds like a copout but it truly is a stifling
question
