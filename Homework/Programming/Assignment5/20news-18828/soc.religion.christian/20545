If I talk with an atheist and tell him the New Testament is an historically 
reliable document what reasons would I give him

  I have found that this isnt a very effective argument  Most atheists are
perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesusbut are
quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into 
misunderstandings hoaxes or simple fabrications  They can always make an
analogy with the Iliad a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan
War but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations
  I dont think its possible to convince atheists of the validity of 
Christianity through argument  We have to help foster faith and an
understanding of God  I could be wrongare there any former atheists here who
were led to Christianity by argument
