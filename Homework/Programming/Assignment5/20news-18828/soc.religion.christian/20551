Especially as we approach a time when Scientists are trying to match Gods 
ability to create life we should use the utmost caution

  I question the implications of this statement namely that there are certain
physical acts which are limited to God and that attempting to replicate these
acts is blasphemy against God  God caused a bush to burn without being
consumedif I do the same thing am I usurping Gods role  
  Religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
removing the physical proofs of Gods existence  As time goes on we have to
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase
science is removing our props  I dont think this is a bad thing
