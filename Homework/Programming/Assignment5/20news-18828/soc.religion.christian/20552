Subject Re Pantheism  Environmentalism

by028clevelandfreenetedu Gary V Cavano writes

does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the
environment being turned unintentionally of course into
pantheism

Ive debated this quite a bit and while I think a legitimate
concern for the planet is a great thing I can easily see it
being perverted into something dangerous

  Many pagans are involved in environmentalismthis is only natural since
respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations  This
doesnt mean that environmentalism is wrong any more than supporting peace in
the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it

  Nonetheless paganism is certainly on the rise and we as Christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity  Like
it or not pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be
and isnt  
  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has
forgotten  This doesnt mean that paganism is right but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement
  First paganism respects the feminine  Christianity has a long history of
oppressing women and many if not most male Christians are still unable to
live in a nonsexist manner  The idea that God is sexless or that Christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission is met with a great
deal of resistance  This insistance on a maledominated theology and the 
maledominated society that goes with it drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches
  Second paganism respects the physical world  This is an idea with great
ramifications  One of these is environmentalismrespect for our surroundings
and our world  Another is integration of sexuality  Christianity has a long
tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality  This is too muchsex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option  
Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic and paganism
is an attractive option
  Im not advocating that Christian doctrines no sex before marriage etc
should be changedjust that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality and neither one does much to bring us closer to God
