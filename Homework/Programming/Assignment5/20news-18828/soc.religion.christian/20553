Subject Re Opinions asked about rejection


  Heres how I talk to nonChristians who are complaining about Hell

ME	Do you believe youre going to Heaven
HIM	I dont believe in Heaven
ME	So are you going there
HIM	If there was a heaven I would
ME	But since there isnt a Heaven youre not going there are you
HIM	No

  The point is that Heaven is based on faithif you dont believe in heaven
theres no way youre going to be in it
  Of course the next step is I dont believe in Hell either so why will I
be there  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God
Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never
see Godso they do in fact believe that theyre going to Hell
  Hell doesnt have to be worse than earth to be Hellbecause its eternal 
and its a lot worse than Heaven  Thats the only comparison that matters
