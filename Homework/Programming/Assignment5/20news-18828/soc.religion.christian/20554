Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

Id like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of
Christians and look forward to any responses  In my
encounters with Christians I find myself dismayed by their
belief that their faith is total truth  According to them
their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of
God and God is truth  thus they know the truth  This stance
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own
hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way
Their way is the truth

But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe
a particular way  That choice is part faith and part reason
but it seems to me a choice

My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard
discussions when I was in grade school

A kid would say All policemen are jerks  Id ask How do
you know  Because my daddy told me so  How do you know
youre daddy is right  He says hes always right

Well the argument usually stops right there  In the end
arent we all just kids groping for the truth  If so do we have
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as
false



This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup  I
apologize if Im covering tired old ground  Some of the
discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome
any comments

Im sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this  I
can understand criticisms of Christianity that say theres not enough
evidence to believe it or that theres just as good evidence for
other religions  I dont agree but clearly there are plenty of
intelligent people who dont find the evidence convincing  But that
doesnt seem to be your point  Rather you seem upset that people who
believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict
it are false

This suggests a model of spiritual things thats rather different than
the Christian one  It sounds more like an existentialist view where
people choose what value to follow but theres no actual independent
spiritual reality and so no way to say that a specific choice is in
some unique sense right  This sort of model  with modifications of
one sort or another  may be appropriate for some religions  But
Christianity is in its essense a historical religion  That is its
based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out
there that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways
and that we see evidence of that in history  In the mundane world
we are not free to choose how things work  When we drop something it
falls aside from welldefined situations where it doesnt  The
Christian concept is that spiritual matters there is also an actual
external reality  I hope were all honest enough not to claim that we
have perfect understanding  But while we may not think we know
everything we are confident that we know some things  And that
implies that we think things that contradict them are false  I dont
see how else we could proceed

This neednt result in arrogance  Im certainly interested in talking
with people of other religions  They may have things to teach me and
even if they dont I respect them as fellow human beings  But its
got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some
matters they are wrong  Maybe even disasterously wrong
