 The apostate church of Revelation most likely refers to the 1st century
 Jews who rejected their Messiah and had Him crucified  John refers to them

 Im afraid not It refers to the church that Christ founded Many many
 times he warns that the church will fall away into heresy as do the
 apostles For an example look at the parables in Matthew 133133 They
 refer to the kingdom of heaven the church and the process of how
 they will be corrupted

Sorry but I think this interpretation of the Matthew 13 parables is
nonsense Ie

 yeast  ALWAYS stands for sincorruptionheresy For example beware
 of the yeast of the Pharisees 

Matthew 1612 explains that by leaven of the Pharisees Jesus was simply
referring to their teaching not sincorruptionheresy

Jesus gaves His apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
the gates of hell would not prevail against His church
