From mcovingtaisun3aiugaedu Michael Covington
Subject Environmentalism and paganism

I would like to see Christians devote a bit less effort to bashing
paganism and more to figuring out how to present the Gospel to pagans

Christ is the answer the pagans have a lot of the right questions
Unlike materialists who deny the need for any spirituality
