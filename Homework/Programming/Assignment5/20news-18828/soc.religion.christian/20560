I was raised in a religious atmosphere and attended 13 years of
religious educational institutions  I know the bible well So well
I can recognize many passages from memory  

stuff deleted for brevity

Christianity is an infectious cult  The reasons it flourishes are 
because 1 it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
a safety blanked to hide behind  Oh wowall i have to do is 
follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness
For all of you found jeezus  how many of you were on the brink

Your very starting point is wrong  Christianity is not based on following
a moral standard  For it is by grace you have been saved through faith
NOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast  Eph 278  You say that
you know the Bible well and can recognize do you mean recite many
passages from memory  That could very well be so  However it looks like
there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to  Titus 35
and James 210 are among them

Obedience to the moral law is imporant  However it is supposed to be the
result of turning your life over to Christ and becoming a Christian  It is
by no means the starting point
