 Which brings me around to asking an open question  Is the
 Bible a closed book of Scripture  Is it okay for us to go
 around saying God told me this and Jesus told me that 

 Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies
 are nothing new but rather an inspired translation of
 scripture  Is it right to call that prophecy  Misleading 

Hi You might want to read Charismatic Chaos by John MacArthur  In it
he discussed exactly this queation amongst others  In my own words
VERY simplified his position is basically that one must decide what
is the most important  experience or Scripture  People tend to say
Scripture without living according to that  Their own
feelingprophecyetc tends to be put across without testing in the
light of Scripture

Theres a lot more than this really worthwhile to read whether youre
Charismatic or not

Groetnis cheers
 Deon
