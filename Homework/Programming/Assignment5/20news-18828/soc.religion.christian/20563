 Now as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical
 can you elaborate  Im not exactly sure what you mean  How does the
 suggestion relate to Isaiahs prophecy of the birth of Christ by a virgin 
 I dont see any cycles in that prophecy
 
 Maybe cyclical is not the best word  
 
 Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas and his bishoprick
 let another take  Another example is something that Isaiah said of His
 disciples which is also applied to Christ in Hebrews the children thou
 hast given me
 
 How does the preterist view account for this phenomenon

Ah doublefulfillment  First of all I would say that Im not sure all
the prophecies had doublefulfillment eg the Isaiah 714 prophecy

I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
it will occur always especially with regard to NT prophecies The apostles
who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine
messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church  No one has
that authority today  No one has the apostolic authority to say that
suchandsuch a prophecy has doublefulfillment  If the imagry of
Revelation fits with events of the 1st century it is folly for us to try
and make it apply to events 20 centuries later
