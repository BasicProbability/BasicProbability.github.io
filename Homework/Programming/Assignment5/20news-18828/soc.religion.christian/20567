  Heres how I talk to nonChristians who are complaining about Hell

ME	Do you believe youre going to Heaven
HIM	I dont believe in Heaven
ME	So are you going there
HIM	If there was a heaven I would
ME	But since there isnt a Heaven youre not going there are you
HIM	No

  The point is that Heaven is based on faithif you dont believe in heaven
theres no way youre going to be in it

    Hmmm people in the americas before the time of Christ children who
die young etc 


  Of course the next step is I dont believe in Hell either so why will I
be there  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God


   But of course the popular conception of hell correct or incorrect is
something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least


Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever and never
see Godso they do in fact believe that theyre going to Hell

   I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond 
bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
theyre going to hell They believe theyre going to die Understand
that youve turned Hell into a verb Using the same logic it also follows
that all animals are going to Hell Are you sure this is what you want
to say presumably animals dont have the opportunity to get to heaven
but this still doesnt change the fact that theyre going to Hell die
a final death

   I dont claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some
sort but if Hell is as you described final death and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that
there will never be a moment when I am aware of my nonexistence 
assuming I go to Hell and not to Heaven In other words Ill
never know Im dead Hmmm 


  Hell doesnt have to be worse than earth to be Hellbecause its eternal

    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died
 At least shes not suffering any more Shes in Heaven now 

    Consider the following statement
 At least shes not suffering any more Shes in Hell now

    The above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of Hell 
it would be a true statement The person in Hell would not be suffering 
Granted they wouldnt be anything wouldnt be having any
conscious experience whatsoever 

    You say Hell death is eternal However this loses its meaning 
to a dead person And to me it seems that the threat of some sort 
of eternal punishment only makes sensehas force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity 

    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda Friend do you want the FREE gift of eternal life
Its my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife
Can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all
animals share The difference is we have consciousness and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of
supersurvival 

 
and its a lot worse than Heaven  Thats the only comparison that matters

    That would depend on what Heaven is like If God is a King and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King
I might opt for Hell I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to
convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book The Illusion of Immortality
by Corliss Lamont The missionary started to speak about Heaven 
Are there seals in heaven Will we be able to go hunting asked an
Eskimo The missionary said no The group of Eskimos then said something
to the effect of Well what good is your Heaven if theres no hunting
Scram I highly recommend the above book IOI to anyone who wants an
account of the other side of the immortality coin that there is no 
immortality
