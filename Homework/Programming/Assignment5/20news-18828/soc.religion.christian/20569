Subject Re Prodigal Son

The parable of the Prodigal Son is not about who is and who isnt an
immoral person It is about grace and the love of God Most people
would agree with that concerning the younger son The elder son is
simply a negative example of the some thing He thinks that he must
earn his fathers love that he has earned it that he is entitled
to it His father tells him that he is on the wrong track He has always
been lovedfor the same reason his brother has always been he is
his fathers son

We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point We are
willing to be saved by grace but once we are Christians we want to
go back to earning and deserving

Are you so foolish After beginning with the Spirit are you now trying
 to attain your goal by human effort Gal 33 NIV
