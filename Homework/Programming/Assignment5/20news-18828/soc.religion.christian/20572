Subject Eternity of Hell was Re Hell

 Im inclined to read descriptions such as the lake of fire as 
 indicating annihilation However thats a minority view

 Its my personal view but the only denominations I know of that hold 
 it officially are the JWs and SDAs

I cant find the reference right now but didnt CSLewis speculate 
somewhere that hell might be the state of once having been a human 
soul
