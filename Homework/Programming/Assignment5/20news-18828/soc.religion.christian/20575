 Firstly I am an atheist I am not posting here as an immature flame
 start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience
 
 Strong opinions start here
 
 1 The human being is an animal who has due to hisher advanced
 mental facilities developed religion as a satisfiable solution to
 explain the unexplainable  For example the ancient Greeks believed
 that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real  Due
 to the advancement of our technology we know this to be false

This is certainly a valid objection to religionasexplanationof
nature  

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science  For
example why does the universe exist at all  After all the timespace
world didnt have to exist  Why does anything exist And is it
possible for persons eg man to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
life  the creation of the world and of persons  provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found outside that world in its Source


 We are just animals  We need sleep food and we reproduce  And we
 die      
 
 Religion especially Christianity is nothing more than a DRUG
 Some people use drugs as an escape from reality  Christians inject
 themselves with jeezus and live with that high 

When you say that man is only an animal I have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement  a dogma if you will  And one
the requires a kind of faith too   By taking such a hard line in
your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own

But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow I hope
youll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by
reading Paul Johnsons A History of Christianity  From your remarks
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
religion and not others  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth and
be animated by some enduring values

With best wishes
