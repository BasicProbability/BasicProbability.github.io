Pardon me a humble atheist but exactly what is the difference
between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis ie
regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary as an
absolute truth fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance

     They sound like one and the same to me

     I see no wisdom whatsoever in your words

Im not surprised that you see no wisdom in them  That is because your
premises are wrong from the word Go  You claim that Christianity is
based on blind faith but this simply is not so  Just look at the
current thread on the evidence for Jesus resurrection for evidence
that Jesus was real and that he triumphed over death

Furthermore you say that Christians hold to their beliefs regardless of
any evidence that you may find to the contrary  Without any evidence
to support your claim this statement is little more than an ad hominem 
argument

Mind you I dont mean this as a personal attack  Im merely pointing out
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning Christianity in this fashion
It would make much more sense if you could prove that all Christians do 
base their belief on empty nothings and that they do ignore all evidence to 
the contrary  Only then can you expect your attack to make sense
