Subject RE Does God love you

  However Gods love is qualified  The Bible says
 
      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD  but he
      loveth him that followeth after righteousness   Proverbs 159
 
      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of
      the ungodly shall perish                            Psalm 16
 
  
I am extremely uncomfortable with this way of phrasing it  Gods love 
is unconditional unqualified unfathomable  We are capable of 
rejecting Gods love but He never fails to love us

These verses do not show that Gods love is qualified but rather that He 
is opposed to evil

I am uncomfortable with the tract in general because there seems to be 
an innappropriate emphasis on Hell  God deserves our love and worship 
because of who He is  I do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting Christ  

I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows Gods love with 
putting into words and explaining that love  Preaching the Gospel 
without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a 
clanging cymbal

Heres a question  How many of you are Christians because you are 
afraid of going to Hell  How many are responding to Gods love
