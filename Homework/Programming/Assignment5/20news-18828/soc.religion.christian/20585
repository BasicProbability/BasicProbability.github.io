 This is certainly a valid objection to religionasexplanationof
 nature  

 Fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of
 questions that can never be reduced away by natural science  For
 example why does the universe exist at all  

Must there be a why to this  I ask because of what you also
     assume about God namely that He just exists with no why
     to His existence  So the question is reversed Why cant
     we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to
     just exist  Why must there be a why to the universe

 After all the timespace
 world didnt have to exist  Why does anything exist And is it
 possible for persons eg man to come into being out of a purely
 impersonal cosmos  These questions which look at the real mysteries of
 life  the creation of the world and of persons  provide a permanent
 indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
 found outside that world in its Source

It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also
     create man  Now I dont see this happening in my lifetime
     nor do I assert it is probable  But the possibility is there
     given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic
     code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation
     Again though must there be why or a divine prupose to
     mans existence

 When you say that man is only an animal I have to think that you are
 presenting an unprovable statement  a dogma if you will  And one
 the requires a kind of faith too   By taking such a hard line in
 your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own

As far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory  Now
     if there were something more to the man say a soul then
     we have yet to find evidence of such  But as it is now man
     is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk were
     warmblooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in
     genetic construction to some of them in particular primates
     For more on this check out talkorigins

 But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow I hope
 youll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by
 reading Paul Johnsons A History of Christianity  From your remarks
 it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian
 religion and not others  Even an atheist should have enough faith in
 Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth and
 be animated by some enduring values

Well then Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Hinduism Judaism
     Zoerasterism Shintoism and Islam should fit this bit of logic
     quite nicely   All have depth all have enduring values
     thus all must be true
