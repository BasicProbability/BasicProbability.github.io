Subject Re Prayer in Jesus Name

According to what I have read on Biblical idioms speaking in Xs
name is a standard AramaicHebrew legal idiom for what we today
would call Power of Attorney  A person from Jesus culture authorized
to conduct business in Johns name had full authority over Johns
financial affairs but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to
work only for Johns benefit and consonant with Johns wishes  It was
not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with
in Johns name it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney
and be operating in good faith Note the overlap here between legal
and religious definitions of faith

With this cultural background praying in Jesus name does not
mandate a particular verbal formula rather it requires that the
petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous
fiduciary relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His
Kingdom  The message of praying in Jesus name is thus closely
aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about Gods
delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards both resources and
responsibilities  This idea of praying in Jesus name is not only
present but prominent in the Lords Prayer although the verbal
forumula is absent

The act of praying the words In Jesus Name may be beneficial if
they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the
advancement of Gods Kingdom  For that reason Im not quite ready
to say that the praying the formula is without meaning

Prayers to God for other purposes desperation anger thanksgiving
etc dont seem to be in this category at all whether uttered by
Christian or nonChristian whether BC or AD thats BCE or
CE for you PC   I dont see anything in Christs words to
contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His
omniscience and grace
