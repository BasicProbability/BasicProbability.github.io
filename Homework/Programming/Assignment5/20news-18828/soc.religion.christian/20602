  Im inclined to read descriptions such as the lake of fire as 
  indicating annihilation However thats a minority view
 
  Its my personal view but the only denominations I know of that hold 
  it officially are the JWs and SDAs
 
 I cant find the reference right now but didnt CSLewis speculate 
 somewhere that hell might be the state of once having been a human 
 soul
Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure
from punishing people  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
his angels

To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the Bible
teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement  Their
judgement is soon to come

Let me suggest this  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it  Stay away
from human theories and only take into account references in the bible
