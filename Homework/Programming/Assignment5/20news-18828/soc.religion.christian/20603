   I dont think its possible to convince atheists of the validity of 
 Christianity through argument  We have to help foster faith and an
 understanding of God  I could be wrongare there any former atheists here
 who were led to Christianity by argument

This is an excellent question and Ill be anxious to see if there are
any such cases  I doubt it  In the medieval period esp 10thcent
when Aquinas flourished argument was a useful tool because everyone
knew the rules  Today when you cant count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one

Sorry just one of my perennial gripes
