Subject SSPX schism 

Hi All

Hope you all had a Blessed Easter I have a document which I believe
refutes the notion that the SSPX Society of Saint Pius X is in
schism or that there has been any legitimate excommunication If
anyone is interested in reading the truth about this matter please
email me and Ill send them the document via email Its 26 pages long
so I wont be posting it on the news group

Its titled


    NEITHER SCHISMATIC NOR EXCOMMUNICATED


    This article  was  originally  an  English	translation  by  the
    Society  of  Saint	Pius  X  in  Ireland from the French Journal
    Courrier de Rome  The French  article  in  its	turn  was  a
    translation  from  the  Italian of the Roman Newsletter Si Si No
    No

    This booklet contains the transcription with some minor editing
    of	the  Irish  article and was transcribed and produced by John
    Clay Townsville Queensland Australia
