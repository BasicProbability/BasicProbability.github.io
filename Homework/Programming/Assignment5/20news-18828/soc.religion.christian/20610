  What is the objection to celebration of Easter
       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it 
Easter or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings is the pagan
whore goddess of fertility  
  It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus
      No you are thinking perhaps of Ressurection Sunday I think 

Tsktsk Too much argument on nonissues 
Im Roman Catholic and it seems to me that people
celebrate Easter and Christmas for itself rather
than how it relates to Jesus I dont really
care about some diety If people have some other
definition of Easter then thats their business
Dont let it interfere with my Easter

Resurrection Sunday 8 Where did that come from 
If people celebrate Easter for the Cadburry bunny
thats their business 

  So from this I infer that there are different rules for
  Christians of Jewish descent  What happened to there is
  neither Jew nor Greek slave nor free male nor female for
  all are one in Christ Jesus

Ive always been curious about this Is Jesus important
to Jews at all  I thought He was thought of only
as a prophet  If thats true what do they celebrate
Easter for
