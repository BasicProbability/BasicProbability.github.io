Subject When are two people married in Gods eyes

I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in Gods eyes  Some say that if the two have
publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective
qualifier they are marriedjoined in Gods sight

Suppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time
because of purely logistical reasons beyond their control  What do you
think about this

Post or email me with general responses  If you need clarification as to
what I am asking please email

Thanks and God bless
