Subject Need Help with They came for the Jews quote

Years ago I grabbed the following from the net  maybe from this
newsgroup  Does anyone know of a source for whether this is an
accurate quote   Thanks  Bartletts leaves out the homosexual lines
but they were one of the groups the Nazis tried to exterminate

In Germany they first came for the communists
and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a communist
Then they came for the jews
and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a jew
Then they came for the trade unionists
and I didnt speak up because I wasnt a trade unionist
Then they came for the homosexuals and I didnt speak up
because I wasnt a homosexual
Then they came for the catholics and I didnt speak up
because I was a protestant
Then they came for me 
but by that time there was no one left to speak up
