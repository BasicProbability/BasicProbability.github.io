   	I realize Im entering this discussion rather late but I do
   have one question Wasnt it a Reagan appointee James Watt a
   pentacostal christian I think who was the secretary of the interior
   who saw no problem with deforestation since we were living in the
   last days and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods
   anyway

   I heard the same thing but without confirmation that he actually said it
   It was just as alarming to us as to you the Bible says that nobody knows
   when the second coming will take place

Nor does it say that if you do find out when it will happen you
should rape everything in sight just before
