Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

They believe the danger is real but others may not

Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning
others of the danger Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs
are correct and all others are false

Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance and behave in an
arrogant manner but that is a personal idiocyncracy It does not
necessarily mean that they are all arrogant

No the members of the first group are not necessarily
arrogant  But when I ask them if they are absolutely certain
that the volcano will erupt I expect them to say so No
but Ive chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have
determined that the volcano will erupt rather than Yes I am
absolutely certain  When it comes to religious discussions
arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of
statement
