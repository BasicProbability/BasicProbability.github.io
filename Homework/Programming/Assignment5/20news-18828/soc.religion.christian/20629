Hi All

Hope you all had a Blessed Easter I have a document which I believe
refutes the notion that the SSPX Society of Saint Pius X is in
schism or that there has been any legitimate excommunication If
anyone is interested in reading the truth about this matter please
email me and Ill send them the document via email Its 26 pages long
so I wont be posting it on the news group

I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net
My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism
or legitimately excommunicated  But thats really beside the point
What does the Roman Catholic church say  Excommunication can be
real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law

After all we Orthodox dont cinsider ourselves schismatic or
excommunicated  But the Catholic Church considers us dissident

If this is inappropriate for this group or beyond the charter
Im sure OFM will let us know

I think its within the charter  Whether this is actually the best
group in which to discuss it is up to the people concerned  I am not
interested in having this reinvoke the general CatholicProtestant
polemics but I dont see why it should  the issue is primarily one
specific to Catholics  clh
