My guess is that the Lazarus come out was also for the sake of the
crowd
 
I read somewhere I think in Morton Smiths Jesus the Magician that
old Lazarus wasnt dead but going in the tomb was part of an initiation
rite for a magicult of which Jesus was also a part   It appears that
a 3day stay was normal   I wonder  

I havent read that book but another one by Smith in which similar
claims were made about Jesus  While Im sure Smith knows more about
early Chrisitanity than I do I found his arguments similar to those
of books like Holy Blood Holy Grail  building conjectures on top
of other conjectures  There was no direct evidence  If youd like
to summarize the argument for us Id be happy to see it  But in
doing so Id like you to pay careful attention to the nature of
the evidence  clh
