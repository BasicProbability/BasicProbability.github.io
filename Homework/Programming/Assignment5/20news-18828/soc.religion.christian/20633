 	I realize Im entering this discussion rather late but I do
 have one question Wasnt it a Reagan appointee James Watt a
 pentacostal christian I think who was the secretary of the interior
 who saw no problem with deforestation since we were living in the
 last days and ours would be the last generation to see the redwoods
 anyway
 
 I heard the same thing but without confirmation that he actually said it
 It was just as alarming to us as to you the Bible says that nobody knows
 when the second coming will take place

I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect though it was quite a few
years back and I cant cite the specifics  I also recall that Cecil Andrus who
was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration responded
to Watts comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave
to man as recorded in Genesis  Which makes me wonder who are the
true conservatives  It seems to me that a conservative should want to
conserve things of value for longterm societal benefit  This form of
conservation should logically extend to the physical environment in 
which people live as well as the moral environment in which they relate
to one another and to God

IMHO Watts stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served 
on the board of directors for Jim Bakkers organization during a time in 
which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker 
in federal prison
