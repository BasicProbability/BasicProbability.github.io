This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is Gods will for his family without consulting his wife  God reveals 
His will to both the husband and the wife  There needs to be some 
degree of mutuality in decision making  Even those whose understanding 
of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family  
One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband 
and to the husband through the wife

I agree  God makes the husband the head of the house  But he surely
cant do it alone  He needs the help of his beloved wife whom the
Lord gave him

At least thats how it is in my house  I thank God for the beautiful
woman He has brought into my life  I couldnt lead without the help
of my wonderful wife
