     ps  If you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow
it blindly  

     Do the words Question Authority mean anything to you

     I defy any theist to reply      

  ok  i dont follow god blindly  once long ago i questioned authority
to such a rabid point that i found questionauthorityrejectauthority
unquestioningly  i question authority all the time  but to forever
question is fruitlesseventually we have to consider whether there are
answers to the questions whether the authority say the bible in this
case has validity  basically to question authority does not necessarily
mean reject authority
