Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

 In the New Testament sorry I dont have a Bible at work and cant
 provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover
 their heads in church  Now this is scripture  By your definition 
 this is truth and therefore absolute  

Do women in your church speak  Do they cover their heads  If all 
scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and 
coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals  
Yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
heads  At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew 
up in

Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth  And there are plenty of other examples
Can you reconcile this

The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about
the Bible which they dont actually believe or practice Ive known
all sorts of Christians ranging from the trendiest of liberals to
the firebreathing fundamentalists and although many on the 
conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is
a perhaps the source of absolute truth I dont know of anyone
who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition
While I am not a Roman Catholic I believe this is close to the official
position of the RC church perhaps an RC would like to comment

The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in
terms of the social context of the time You would think the fact 
that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophatandcane 
and give you some big songanddance routine about why this 
other passages as well arent directly applicable today would 
show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they 
actually practice are two different things but mostly it doenst

While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians
I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy in this
case making claims about the Bible which the claimants dont actually
put into practice But if we step back from the namecalling and
look at what people are attempting to say we see that they are trying
to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the
Christian faith So when people use such words or phrases as Word of
God inerrant infallibale The Manufacturers Handbook The
only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the
Bible we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at
the mere words they use Some of the above descriptions are demostratably
false and others are selfcontradictory but in my experience people are
generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even
when the speakers words are at variance with their intentions A Biblical
example is from the garden of Eden where God asks Where are you and Adam
explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself If Adam had
answered Gods words he would have said something like Im here in this
tree The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these
words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif Most people
have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of
the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases
and explanations that others use

I hope this helps
