Subject Re DID HE REALLY RISE

In article Apr10053359199314428athosrutgersedu mcovingtaisun3aiugaedu Michael Covington writes
The two historic facts that I think the most important are these

1 If Jesus didnt rise from the dead then he must have done something
else equally impressive in order to create the observed amount of impact

2 Nobody ever displayed the dead body of Jesus even though both the
Jewish and the Roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
it would have discredited the Christians

And the two simplest refutations are these

1  What impact  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and that
the recorded impact actually happened  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain
being torn etc  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than 20 years
after the supposed event

2  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbers
Dont bother with the point about the guards  it only appears in one
gospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the graverobbing charge  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen  If there were really
guards they could not have effectively made this claim as they did
