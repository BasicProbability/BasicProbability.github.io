Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure
from punishing people  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
his angels

First of all God does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing
people  He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on
whom he will have compassion Ex 3319  However if he enjoyed
punishing people and sending them to hell then why would he send Jesus
to seek and save that which was lost Luke 1910


To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed remember the Bible
teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement  Their
judgement is soon to come

Let me suggest this  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it  Stay away
from human theories and only take into account references in the bible

You asked for it

2 Peter 24ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished
Matthew 253146 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in
Gods eyes will be sent to hell for eternity
2 Thessalonians 1610 states that those who cause trouble for the
disciples will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out
from the presence of the Lord
2 Thessalonians 2912 talks about those who refuse to love the truth
being condemned
Revelation 2168 talks about the difference between those who overcomes
and those who do not  Those who do not listed in verse 8 will be in
the fiery lake of burning sulfur
Revelation 14912 gives the indication that those who follow the beast
will be tormented with burning sulfur and there being no rest day or
night for them because of it
Psalm 917  The wicked return to the grave all the nations that
forget God

I think those should be sufficient to prove the point

In the following Im mostly playing devils advocate  Im not
advocating either position  My concern is that people understand that
its possible to see these passages in different ways  Its possible
to see eternal destruction as just that  destruction  Rev often
uses the term second death  The most obvious understanding of that
would seem to be final extinction  The problem is that the NT speaks
both of eternal punishment and of second death  Ie it uses terms
that can be understood either way  My concern here is not to convince
you of one view or the other but to help people understand that
theres a wide enough variety of images that its possible to
understand them either way  As Tom Albrecht commented the primary
point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire
whatever the details  To make things more interesting Luke 2035
implies that the damned dont get resurrected at all  Presumably
they just stay dead  yes Im aware that its possible to 
understand this passage in a nonliteral way

2 Peter 24ff is talking about angels and talks about holding them
in hell until the final judgement  This isnt eternal punishement

Matthew 253146 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire
prepared for the devil and his angels  The fact that the fire is
eternal doesnt mean that people will last in its flames forever
Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been
prepared for the devil and his angels  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the
eternal fire as well  They say that the beast and the false prophet
will be tormented forever in it  When talking about people being
thrown into it 201314 it is referred to as the second death
This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment  Is is possible
that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as
the devil and humans

2 Thessalonians 1610 similarly what is everlasting destruction
This is not necessarily eternal torment  This one can clearly be
understood either way but I think its at least possible to think
that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction
that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in
eternity

2 Thessalonians 28 again talks about destruction
Revelation 2168 see comment above
Revelation 14912 is probably the best of the quotes  Even there
it doesnt explicitly say that the people suffer forever  It says
that the smoke and presumably the fire is eternal and that 
there is no respite from it  But it doesnt say that the people
are tormented forever

Psalm 917  I dont see that it says anything relevant to this issue
