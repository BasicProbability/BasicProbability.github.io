Subject Losing your temper is not a Christian trait

Coming from a long line of hot tempered people I know temper when I see
it  One of the tell tale signsfruits that give nonchristians away  is
when their net replies are acrid angry and sarcastic  

We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed born again
christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to
christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
spiritually hungry  Instead of answering questions with sweetness and
sincerity these chrisitan netwarriors flame the queries 

You dont need any enemies  You already do yourselves the greatest harm

Again I say foolish foolish foolish
