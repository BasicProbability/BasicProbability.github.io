There is no way out of the loop

Oh contrer mon captitan  There is a way  Certainly it is not by human reason
 Certainly it is not by human experience and yet it is both  To paraphrase
Sartre the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point  It
is only because of Gods own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing 
Your logic comes to fruition in relativism  

At the core of all wellfounded belief lies belief that is unfounded
                                                     Ludwig Wittgenstein

Ah now it is clear  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell Ludwigs fame is often
explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in
contemporary philosophy Both revolve around Tractatus LogicoPhilosphicus
21 and Philosophical Investigation 53  Many of Witts comments and
implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of
language he offers  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witts
thought ordinary language is an invaluable resource offering a necessary
framework for the conduct of daily life  However though its formal features
remain the same its content does not and it is always capable of being
transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened giving
us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say  On Witts own
account there is a dynamic fluidity of language   It is for this reason that
any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to
talking about its boundaries where a boundary is understood not as a wall but
a threshold
  vonWrightss comment that Witts sentences have a content that often lies
deep beneath the surface of language  On the surface Witt talks of the
insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing
ourselves to accept it without question  At the same time we are faced with
Witts own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes
in our traditional modes of understanding  Philosophy then through more
perspicacious speech seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it
is already functioning Yes  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to
offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity In his
Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse
of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man 
Perfect language does not exist for fallen man therefore we must get on about
our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language

  This is why Johns Gospel is so dear to most Christians  It is so simple in
it conveyance of the revealation of God yet so full of unlieing depth of
understanding  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of as a man thinketh so
he is  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside
that is the consciousness of Christ  And so must we  Words are only vehicals
of truth  He is truth  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that
there is a Truth and that it is knowable  THere are absolutes and they too
are knowable  However they are only knowable when He reveals them to the
individual  There is and we shouldnt shy from this a mysticism to
Christianity  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world  There is the
one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the
Spirit the Spirit of Truth and there is the one who has the Spirit and has
the capacity to know of the Truth but there  is the third  THe one who not
only has the Spirit but that the Spirit has him Who can know the deep things
of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit  And it is only the deep
things of GOd that are absolute and true
   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced
and it is verifiable  I disagree with Dr Nancys Sweeties conclusion because
if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair  

I would know the words which He would answer me and understand what He would
say unto me  Job 23ff
