 In looking through my files this weekend I ran across some lyrics from
 various rock groups that have content  Here are two from Black Sabbaths
 Master of Reality  Ill say this much for the music of the 60s and early
 70s at least they asked questions of significance  Jethro Tull is another
 to asked and wrote about things that caused one to wonder Rex 
 

It is interesting that you posted those lyrics because just the
other day I was thinking of doing the same  I like those lyrics
since whenever I am approached by judgemental pharisitical
evangelical fundamentalists who throw the Bible at me because
I have long hair wear a black leather jacket and listen to Black
Sabbath I have something to throw back  Usually their chins drop
and they come up speechless over those not very satanic lyrics

It just goes to show that there are more important evils in the
world to battle than rock lyrics
