  Im concerned about a recent posting about WBTSIL  I thought theyd
pretty much been denounced as a rightwing organization involved in
ideological manipulation and cultural interference

Good heavens you mean my good friend Wes Collins who took his wife and two 
small children into the jungles of Guatemala despite dangers from primitive 
conditions and armed guerillas so that the indigenous people groups their 
could have the Bible in their native languagesthe young man who led Bible 
studies in our church who daily demonstrated and declared his deep abiding 
faith in the Lord of Loveyou mean he really was a sneaky imperialistic SPY

    I am sorry you find these charges amusing Mark I understand your
frustration thoughit can be kind of scary to find your assumptions
challenged Some of the specific cultural interference to which I refer
includes linguistic manipulation for instance their TzotzilSpanish
dictionary removed both Spanish and Tzotzil words for concepts which are
threatening to the ruling ideology eg class conquer exploitation
repression revolution and described words which can express
ideological concepts in examples like Bossthe boss is good He treats
us well and pays us a good wage As some of my students would say
NOT  
     Your tone implies that you are unlikely to believe meindeed why
should you If you are interested enough to do some further research
though and you sound as if you are here are some references for you
