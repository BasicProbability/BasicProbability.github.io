 Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
 do something to ease the pain
 
 I have heard this claim quite a few times Does anybody here know
 who first came up with the Godshaped hole business

Ive seen this verse used to back up this idea

He has also set eternity in the hearts of men  Ecclesiastes 311
