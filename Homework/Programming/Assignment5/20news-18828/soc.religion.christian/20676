Subject Anyone with LAbri Experiences

I am curious if anyone in netland has spent any time at any of the LAbri
houses throughout the world and what the experience was like how it affected
you etc  Especially interesting would be experiences at the original LAbri
in Switzerland and personal interactions with Francis andor Edith Schaeffer
