 This is not true Science is a collection of models telling us how
 not why something happens I cannot see any good reason why the why
 questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the
 supernatural domain exists If supernatural beings exist it is
 as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist

I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models
Scientific models are a game to play and are only as good as the
assumptions and measurements if any that go into them

As an example I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in
atmospheric science  It wasnt long after Sagans admonitions that
one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of
the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder  He decided to assume
that the atmosphere is more like a twodimensional thing than a one
dimensional thing  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds
blow in the real atmosphere  On returning to Georgia Tech he showed
a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they
were generated by the models  There was an unmistakable correlation
between the age meaning simplicity of assumptions ie remoteness
from reality of each model and the degree of cooling  Whereas Sagans
model showed an approximate 40degree cooling episode the next model 
in sophistication showed about half that and so on until we got to
our boys model which showed a 12 degree drop if the war happened in
the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer
He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans chemistry
the biosphere and other indicators of reality in the models we would
probably see even less cooling  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even
less than a nuclear autumn one might say to a nuclear fizzle

To quote from HS Yoder

	The postulated models have become accepted as the reality
	instead of the lattice of assumptions they are
	Authoritarianism dominates the field and a very critical
	analysis of each argument is to be encouraged Skepticism
	of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because
	many key parameters have not been included

This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony  Only when
convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results
may one suggest that the model may describe the reality  Just thought
Id clear that up before things really got out of hand
