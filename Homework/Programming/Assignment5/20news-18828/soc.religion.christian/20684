From reidcsuiucedu Jon Reid
Subject Cell Church discussion group

I am beginning an email discussion group about cell churches  If you are
a follower of Jesus Christ and are

   in a cell church or
   in a church that is transitioning to a cell church or
   just interested in learning more about cell churches

send me email  I reserve the right to remove anybody from the group who
does not demonstrate a spirit of humility and Christlikeness

 reidcsuiucedu  to gain what he cannot lose    Jim Elliot
