Subject Question Jesus alone Oneness

Dear fellow netters

From time to time a term like Oneness Pentecostals or something
similar has occurred in posts to this group I also know that there
is a movement called something like Jesus alone 

I believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that but reently
I was made aware that there is at least one person within our church
who holds the view that there is no trinity In the near future we
will discuss this item and I feel that I shall ask you my friends on
this group for background information

Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there
is only Jesus And vice versa The foundations for the Trinity

I shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical
development

Thank you all

In Him

Bjorn
