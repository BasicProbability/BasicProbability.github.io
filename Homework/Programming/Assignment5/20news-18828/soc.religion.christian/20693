 I think its really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
 man even if he did claim to be the son of God andor a prophet

It is just as Christ said about his return

Some will say He is in the desert or some will say He is in the
wilderness  But do not believe them  For as lightning flashes east to
west so shall the coming of the Son of Man be  
                                          My paraphrase  I think the
verse is
                                           somewhere in John
