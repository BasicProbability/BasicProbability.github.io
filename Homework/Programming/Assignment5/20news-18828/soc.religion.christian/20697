Subject etymology of Easter

for SRC

In most languages the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is
known as the PASCH or PASQUE or some variation thereof a word
which comes from the Hebrew PESACH meaning Passover In English
German and a few related languages however it is known as EASTER
or some variation thereof and questions have been asked about the
origin of this term

One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE
RATIONE TEMPORUM 15 where he derives the word from the name of an
AngloSaxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE Bede is a great
scholar and it is natural to take his word for it But he lived
673735 and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597 The use of
the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well
established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth
of anyone he might have discussed the subject with It seems likely
that his derivation is just a guess based on his awareness that
there had been an AngloSaxon goddess of Spring bearing that name
and the resemblance of the words Thus if the said resemblance
surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should
have a name similar to the word for Dawn is not in istelf
convincing the testimony or rather the conjecture by Bede does
not make it more so

Assuming that Bede was right that would not justify saying that the
Christian celebration which after all had been going on for some
centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it has pagan roots
It would simply mean that the AngloSaxons upon becoming Christians
and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every
spring called it by the name that to them meant simply Spring
Festival

However Bedes is not the only theory that has been proposed  J
Knoblech in Die Sprach ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5
Vienna 1959 2745 offers the following derivation

Among Latinspeaking Christians the week beginning with the Feast
of the Resurrection was known as hebdomada alba white week
since the newlybaptized Christians were accustomed to wear their
white baptismal robes throughout that week Sometimes the week was
referred to simply as albae Translaters rendering this into
German mistook it for the plural of alba meaning dawn They
accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM which is Old High German for
dawn This gave rise to the form EASTER in English

No Im not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety
of celebrating Easter  However this seems like it contains enough
interesting information that people might like to see it  clh
