We also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been
wrecked on our world because of Christians  who were certain they were
following Christ  From Captialist  in strict obedience to the Gensis 
innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with you shall not allow a
witch to live the Moslems who were killed in the Crusades the godfearing
men destroyed by the inquistion  The religious wars in Spain France England
etc  Christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss
of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the
instructions therein was unquestionable  There is much to grieve

I agree  Where in the Gospels does Jesus advocate any of the actions
you mention  

I couldnt find witch or sorceress in my concordance  Is there
something in the Epistles about witches  Im still working my way
through the Gospels

The reference is Ex 2218  Its witch in KJ sorceress in RSV  clh
