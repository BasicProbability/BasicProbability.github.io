 It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it  Actions
 prove our faith and show the genuineness of it

A good example of this is Abraham referred to in the James passage Hebrews
says that Abraham was justified by faith  but his faith was demonstrated
through his works ie he obeyed what God told him to do

Reading Abrahams biography in Genesis is very instructive He was a man
beset by lack of faith a lot of the time eg lying about Sarah being his
wife on 2 occasions trying to fulfil Gods promise on Gods behalf by
copulating with Hagar   yet it seems that God didnt evaluate him on the
basis of individual incidents Abraham is listed as one of the heroes of 
faith in Hebrews 11 ie when it really came to the crunch God declared
Abraham as a man of faith He believed Gods promises

This gives us confidence Although real faith demonstrates itself through
works God is not going to judge us according to our successfailure in
performing works

Not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy
he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
Spirit Titus 35

Amazing Grace Hallelujah
