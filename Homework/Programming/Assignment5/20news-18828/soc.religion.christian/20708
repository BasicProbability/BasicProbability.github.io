Subject Re Assurance of Hell

2  If you havent accepted Jesus are your Savior youre taking an awful
chance  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses who no longer frequent my door if
you are right and I am wrong then I will have lived a good life and will die
and cease to exist but if I am right and you are wrong then you will die and
suffer eternal damnation  I dont mean to make fun at this point but its like
Dirty Harry said Youve got to ask yourself Do I feel lucky  Well do
you  A mans got to know his limitations  Dont be one of the whosoever
wonts  

This is a ridiculous argument for being a Christian  So then you might 
consider switching from Christianity to another religion if you were 
offered an even more frightening description of another hell  How many
Christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy
Not many I know they believe in a message of love and compassion for 
others  A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional 
relationship with God  Like a child who cringes in fear of a parents
physical violence  

Many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell with various
threats and persuasions regarding who will go where  Competition over
who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving
your neighbor as yourself
