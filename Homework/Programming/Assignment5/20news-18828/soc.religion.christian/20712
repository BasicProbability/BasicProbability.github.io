Subject Re When are two people married in Gods eyes

I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in Gods eyes 

Im waiting for an RC to speak up  8
Nobody has so I will

Those with Bibles on hand can give the exact chapter  verse
At the time Jesus told Peter that he was the rock He said
whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven and 
whatever you dont hold true wont be true in heaven

Therefore with respect to marriage the ceremony has to be
done by an RC priest No big parties required Just the priest
the couple and witnesses Divorce is not allowed But anullments
are granted upon approval by either the bishop or the Pope 
not sure if the Pope delegates this function
