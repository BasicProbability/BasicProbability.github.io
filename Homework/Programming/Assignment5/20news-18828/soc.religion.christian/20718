Subject Re Accepting Jeesus in your heart

Dan Johnson asked for evidence that the most effective abuse 
recovery programs involve meeting peoples spiritual needs

I responded
 In 12step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous one of the steps
 involves acknowleding a higher power  AA and other 12step abuse
 recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective

Dan Johnson clarified
What I was asking is this

Please show me that the most effective substanceabsure recovery
programs involve meetinsg peoples spiritual needs rather than
merely attempting to fill peoples spiritual needs as percieved
by the people AA SRC regulars or snoopy 

You are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence of
God  I never claimed to be able to do this in fact I do not believe
that it is possible to do so  I consider the existence of God to
be a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life
It comes down to a matter of faith   If I werent a Christian I
would be an agnostic but I have sufficient subjective evidence to
justify and sustain my relationship with God  Again this is a matter
of premises and assumptions  I assume that there is more to life the
universe and everything than materialism ie that spirituality exists
This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritual
needs  I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat
ions  I then find that God fills these spiritual needs  But I cannot 
objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined 
spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs  Nor can I
prove to another person that they have spiritual needs
