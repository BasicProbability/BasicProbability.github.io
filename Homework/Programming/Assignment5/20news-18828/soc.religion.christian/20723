Hi everyone 
	   Im a commited Christian that is battling with a problem  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying You fools
do you still think that just believing is enough

some deleted

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do
as taught in Romans but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being spatout

Can anyone help me this really bothers me

Dear Will

Ive never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok
I had a few thoughts

Faith on its own if not accompanied by action is dead  James 217

Faith is both belief and action
If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming am I really a
swimmer and will people believe that I am
Likewise if I say Im a Christian but I never talk to God am I really a
Christian My faith is demonstrated by my action The fact that we talk to
God proves we have faith Satan believes in God but does not follow Him

In a similar vein I have recently been challenged by 1John236
v3 says We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands
I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that if we have
come to know Him then well obey His commands cos He lives within us and
we cannot help but obey what He says
I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing
us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically
produced in our lives

Hope this helps
