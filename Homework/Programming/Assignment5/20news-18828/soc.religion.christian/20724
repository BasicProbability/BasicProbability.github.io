Subject Re Hell2  Black Sabbath

 I may be wrong but wasnt Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath  Hes a
 MAJOR brother in Christ now  He totally changed his life around and
 he and his wife go on tours singing witnessing and spreading the
 gospel for Christ  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath but I know he
 was in a similar band if it wasnt that particular group

   Yes but Jeff also speaks out against listening to bands like Black
Sabbath He says theyre into all sorts of satanic stuff I dont know
