Subject Re When are two people married in Gods eyes

To recapitulate a bit

 The essence of marriage is two peoples commitment to each other

 If two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not
  willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state thats
  prima facie evidence that the commitment isnt really there

 There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible
  without a civil or church wedding if youre stranded on a desert
  island or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason
  eg laws against interracial marriage

 The legal concept of commonlaw marriage is meant to ensure that
  the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the
  usual ceremony and recordkeeping

 Pastorally Im concerned that people should not use being married
  in Gods eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding
  One has a duty to have ones marriage properly recorded and witnessed
  
 But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony
  without making a genuine commitment and therefore are not married
  in Gods eyes  Right

I think the last statement is dangerous  I believe as long as
someone has formally undertaken the responsibility of marriage they
have a moral obligation even if their intention was not right  Other
people are involved in the marriage covenant  If they believed in
good faith that a marriage occurred then I think there are
obligations created to them  Of course there are situations where
intent can cause a marriage not to exist  The classic example is when
its done as part of a play  But these are exceptions and should be
clear to all parties  clh
