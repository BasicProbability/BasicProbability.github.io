 Are the Serbs doing the work of God  Hmm

 Ive been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question

 Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving
 to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are
 muslims

 CanDoes God use those who are not following him to accomplish
 tasks for him  Esp those tasks that are punative

 no cute sig  but Im working on it

Are you suggesting that God supports genocide
Perhaps the Germans were punishing Jews on Gods behalf

Any God who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of
my worship or faith
