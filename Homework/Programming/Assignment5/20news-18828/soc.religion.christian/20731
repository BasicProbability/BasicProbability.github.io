Subject Looking for Christians in Urbana Illinois


   I apologize if this post isnt entirely appropriate for the newsgroup

   I would like to correspond with any Christians attending the University
of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign  I will be transfering there in August to
complete my PhD and I thought it would be nice to correspond with people
before I moved out
