One of the Laws of Nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
at least to this laymans mind there must be a causal event  No
reasonable alternative exists

The bigbang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point of
origin There was no time for a prior cause to occur in If you
want to invent fables for the surrounding context fine but one fable
is only as good as any other Why should I prefer to believe in a God that
just exists as opposed to a singularity that just happened or 
giant puce subspace iguanas that fling universes off their tongues
like gobs of spit

As far as I can tell the very laws of nature demand a why  That isnt
true of something outside of nature ie supernatural

I believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes
but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining 
reproducing life ever  Ive never been much of a prophet though I
cant even picture New York in my mind 8   I dont believe any
technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite
having all of the parts available Just my opinion

Just your opinion and unfortunately wrong Self assembling molecules
have already been produced entirely from inert matter and have
spontaneously mutated into a more rapidly assembling form on exposure
to ultraviolet light Both abiogenesis and the beginnings of evolution
TODAY saw this in Nature early last year

Biological vitalism is dead and has been dead for many many years
Give it up Life is not a spark Life is the selforganization
of systems poised between chaos and order

Until the King returns

Jason

Your King baldly and repeatedly stated he would be back within the lifetime
of some then present and alive Soon soon he said over and over  as
have many would be messiahs

It is Nineteen Ninety Three

I should have watched this more closely  We had a discussion about
the first cause etc not long ago  Im not up for a replay
There was also a detailed discussion of the point Max brings up
here about the initial singularity  The geometry near the big bang
is very interesting  Time turns into space so there is no before
