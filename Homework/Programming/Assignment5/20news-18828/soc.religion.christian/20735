 Jeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath
 He was never ever a musician in the band  He was in St Louis several
 months back  The poster I saw at the Christian bookstore I frequent
 really turned me off  It was addressed to all Homosexuals prostitutes
 drug addicts alcoholics and headbangers or something like that
 
 Well if I showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket I
 would have felt a little prejudged 

I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didnt find him judgemental  I think
that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate but I think they
were trying to say that headbangers would like the program  But I would
NOT put headbangers in the same class as alcholics etc  it is
condescending  And I believe that Jeff was wearing black when I saw him

By the way Fenholt played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar

Personally Im a headbanger at times too but I have a hard time with what
most of the secular metal groups promote  Free sex and drugs my opinion
that many promote these arent my thing  I HAVE found several good
Christian metal groups that I like

They drew a circle and shut him out
Heretic Rebel a thing to flout
But Love and I had the wit to win
We drew a circle and took him in
