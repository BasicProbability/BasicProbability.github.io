 Id like to remind people of the withering of the fig tree and Jesus
 driving the money changers et al out of the temple  I think those
 were two instances of Christ showing anger as part of His human side
 
Yes and what about Paul saying

26 Be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath
Ephesians 426

Obviously then we can be angry wo sinning

They drew a circle and shut him out
Heretic Rebel a thing to flout
But Love and I had the wit to win
We drew a circle and took him in
