 I may be wrong but wasnt Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath  Hes a
 MAJOR brother in Christ now  He totally changed his life around and

      Why should he have been any different then Ozzy Osbourne
exsinger and main character of the Black Sabbath of good ole days past
is and always was a devout catholic Or so Ive heard over on the
altrocknrollmetal newsgroups an I figure those folks oughta know

 
  Disclaimer   Its great to be young and insane
