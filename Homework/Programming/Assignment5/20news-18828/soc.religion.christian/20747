Subject Re Some questions from a new Christian

OFM responds to a query about reference works

   Aside from a commentary you might also want to consider an
   introduction  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible
   courses  They give historical background discussion of literary
   styles etc  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further
   reading  I typically recommend Kee Froehlich and Youngs NT
   introduction

Two other Intros to consider

The Introduction by Kummel is a translation of a strandard NT text
The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense but
the book contains a wealth of information

Perrin and Dulings Intro is also very good  Its somewhat more
modern than Kummels but not quite so densely packed  Also the
authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order
of composition this gives a very useful perspective on the
development of the NT

    There are also some good onevolume commentaries   Probably the
   best recommendation these days would be Harpers Bible Commentary

A slight dissent I think the Harpers is OK but not great  One
particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on
bibliographic material  My feeling is that it is OK for quick
lookups but not real useful for study in depth eg I keep a copy
in my office at work

    I think there may be a couple of books with this title

So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title
James L Mays general editor Harper and ROw 1988 although I think
I recall a older series under the name Harper Commentaries  Also
theres a separate Harpers Bible Dictionary most of my comments on
the HC also apply to the HBD

My favorite onevolume commentary is the New Jerome Biblical
Commentary  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased
towards the NT  The reader can decide for her or himself whether
these are pluses or minuses  In any case the scholarship is by and
large excellent

NOTE The NJBC is a completely reworked updated version of the
Jerome Biblical Commentary copies of which can still be found on
sale
