 Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
 do something to ease the pain
 
 I have heard this claim quite a few times Does anybody here know
 who first came up with the Godshaped hole business
 

Was it Pascal or maybe Descartes who first used this figure of speech 
I seem to have some vague recollections from reading some of their essays
but I certainly couldnt say it was one of them for sure
