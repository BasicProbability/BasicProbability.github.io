Any former atheists converted by argument
This is an excellent question and Ill be anxious to see if there are
any such cases  I doubt it  In the medieval period esp 10thcent
when Aquinas flourished argument was a useful tool because everyone
knew the rules  Today when you cant count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one
 
 The last sentence is ironic since so many readers of
 socreligionchristian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as
 Josh McDowell and CS Lewis

I havent followed whatever discussion there may have been on these
people but I feel that C S Lewis is an excellent apologist and I
see no reason for embarrassment  If you think that errors and flawed
arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker you must dismiss
nearly every thinker from Descartes to Kant any philosophy course
will introduce you to their weaknesses  
 
  The above also expresses a rather odd sense
 of history What makes you think the masses in Aquinas day who were
 mostly illiterate knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
 today If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
 cream of the crop so to speak could read and write If everyone in
 the medieval period knew the rules it was a matter of uncritically
 accepting what they were told

I said nothing about the masses  However comparing the masses in
our day and in Aquinas day really is odd  Read Ortega y Gasset on
this

Im talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and
winning on logic and evidence only to discover your opponent to be
unaware even intuitively of things like entailment let alone
pragmatics  I am assuming that both parties are college graduates
or better  Myself I dont bother any more
