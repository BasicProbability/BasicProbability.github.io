 Hi

 I am new to this newsgroup and also fairly new to christianity
  I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and
 quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true This I am trying
 to rectify by reading the Bible of course but it would be helpful
 to also read a good interpretationcommentary on the Bible or other
 relevant aspects of the Christian faith One of my questions I would
 like to ask is  Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological
 works intended for a lay person

Id recommend McDowells Evidence that Demands a Verdict books 3 I
think and  Manfred Brauchs Hard Sayings of Paul  He also may have
done Hard Sayings of Jesus  My focus would be for a new Christian to
struggle with his faith and be encouraged by the historical evidence
especially one who comes from a background which emphasizes knowable faith
