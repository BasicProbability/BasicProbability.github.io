Subject Re When are two people married in Gods eyes

I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in Gods eyes 

Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony
nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so

Lets distinguish real logistical problems like being stranded on a
desert island from excuses such as waiting for soandsos brother
to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony
