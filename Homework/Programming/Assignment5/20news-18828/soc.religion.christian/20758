Subject MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY

With Franks permission I have added some information here and in
one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify
the historical relationship of the views  My comments are based
primarily on William Ruschs historical summary in The Trinitarian
Controversy Fortress  Im going to save this as an FAQ  clh

MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY
 
SECOND CENTURY

The writers of the 2nd Cent are important because they set up much
of the context for the later discussions  Justin Martyr Aristides
Athenagoras Tatian and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the
Apologists  Their theology has often been described as Logos
theology  Based strongly on wording in John they took more or less
a twophase approach  Through eternity the Logos was with the
Father as his mind or thought  This immanent Word became
expressed as God revealed himself in history ultimately in Jesus
Thus Jesus full distinction from the Father only became visible in
history though the Logos had been present in God from eternity
Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the
final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated
because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with
the eternal plurality in the Godhead

Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists  However he
was uncomfortable with the twostage approach  He still viewed God as
one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible
except through his process of selfrevelation the economy  The
distinctions are present in his essential nature  Irenaeus emphasized
the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists  Irenaeus views should
probably be called economic trinitarianism though that term is
normally used as below to refer to later developments


THIRD CENTURY

clh

Dynamic Monarchianism
 
Source Theodotus
Adherents Paul of Samosota Artemon Socinus Modern Unitarians
Perception of Gods Essence The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature
and oneness of person The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are
consubstantial with the Fathers divine essence only as impersonal attributes
The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus but he was not God in the strict
sense of the word
Perception of Gods Subsistence The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable
impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible The
diversity of God is apparent and not real since the Christ event and the
work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God not to
a hypostatic union
Asignation of DeityEternality
 Father Unique originator of the universe He is eternal selfexistent and
without beginning or end
 Son A virtuous but finite man in whose life God was dynamically present in
a unique way Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified
 Holy Spirit An impersonal attribute of the Godhead No deity or eternality
is ascribed to the Holy Spirit
Criticisms Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation
concerning the Trinity Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the
Holy Spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical
doctrine of salvation
In summary this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism
at all  God is an undifferentiated one  Son and Holy Spirit are seen
as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the
Church  clh

 
Modalistic Monarchianism
 
Source Praxeas
Adherents Noatus Sabellius Swedenborg Scleiermacher United Pentecostals
Jesus Only
Perception of Gods Essence The unity of God is ultrasimplex He is
qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person  This
essence may be designated interchangeably as Father Son and Holy Spirit
They are different names for but identical with the unified simplex God The
three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself
Perception of Gods Subsistence The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous
and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of Gods modalistic manifesting
of himself The paradox of a subsisting three in oneness is refuted by
recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different
names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama
Asignation of DeityEternality
 Father Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of
the only unique and unitary God
 Son Full deityeternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another
mode of the one God and identical with his essence he is the same God
manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation
 Holy Spirit Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the
one God in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of
regeneration and sanctification
Criticisms Depersonalizes the Godhead To compensate for its Trinitarian
deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical Its
concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such
simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christs baptism
Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy  There are
actually two slightly different groups included Noetus and his
followers and Sabellius  Noetus was apparently more extreme
Sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic
Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view  Unfortunately
information about Sabellius comes from a century later and there
seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra clh
 
Ive moved the following description to be with the other
thirdcentury views  It originally appeared near the end  clh

Economic Trinitarianism
 
Source Hippolytus Tertullian
Adherents Various neoeconomic Trinitarians
Perception of Gods Essence The Godhead is characterized by triunity Father
Son and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical
indivisible substance The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially
comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption
Perception of Gods Subsistence Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated
by means of such terms as distinction and distribution dispelling
effectively the notion of separateness or division
Asignation of DeityEternality
The equal deity of Father Son and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in
observation of the simultaneous relationaloperational features of the
Godhead Coeternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this
ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication
Criticisms Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the
relational aspect of the Trinity
Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus as
mentioned above  As with them the threeness is visible primarily in
the various ways that God revealed himself in history  However they
did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow
present in the Godhead from the beginning  Tertullian talks of
the Father Son and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in
substance  Many people regard this view as being essentially
orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories  clh

Origen developing further an approach started by Clement attempted
to apply neoPlatonism to Christian thought  He set many of the terms
of the coming battle  In Platonic fashion he sees the Son as a
mediator mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality
of creating beings  The Son is generated but he is eternally
generated  That is the relationship between Father and Son is
eternal  It cannot be said that there was once when he was not a
phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries  Having the Son
is intrinsic to his concept of God  The Father and Son are described
as separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaning
of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts  The union is
one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may
have used the term homoousios of the same substance  The Holy
Spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the Father
through the Son  Origens intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but
he pushes things in the direction of separateness


FOURTH CENTURY

clh

Subordinationism  often called Arianism clh
 
Source Arius
Major Adherents Modern Jehovahs Witnesses and several other lesser known
cults
Perception of Gods Essence The inherent oneness of Gods nature is properly
identifiable with the Father only The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet
entities who do not share the divine essence
Perception of Gods Subsistence The unipersonal essence of God precludes the
concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead Threeness in oneness is self
contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God
Asignation of DeityEternality
 Father The only one unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning
 Son A created being and therefore not eternal Though he is to be venerated
he is not of the divine essence
 Holy Spirit A nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the Father He is viewed
as an influence an expression of God  Deity is not ascribed to him
Criticisms It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting
the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit Its hierarchial concept likewise
asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father Christ
and the Holy Spirit This results in a totally confused soteriology
Note also that in most versions of this view the Son is not fully
human either  He is supernatural and sinless  That distinguishes this
view from adoptionism  clh
 
Orthodox Trinitarianism
 
Source Athanasius
Adherents Basil Gregory of Nyssa Gregory of Nazianzus Augustine Thomas
Aquinas Luther Calvin Contemporary orthodox Christianity
Perception of Gods Essence Gods being is perfectly unified and simplex of
one essence  This essence of deity is held in common by Father Son and Holy
Spirit The three persons are consubstantial coinherent coequal and co
eternal
Perception of Gods Subsistence The divine subsistence is said to occur in
three modes of being or hypostases As such the Godhead exists undivided in
divided persons This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation
in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead
Asignation of DeityEternality
In its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father Son
and Holy Spirit as coequal and coeternal in the Godhead with regard to both
the divine essence and function
Criticisms The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in
human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the
ineffable mystery of three in oneness
At least in the 4th Cent there were several different approaches all
of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which
are somewhat different in detail  Nicea was originally held to respond
to Arius  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origens thought a bit
too far to the point of making the Son a separate entity  In general
the East tended to take an approach based on Origens and it was hard
to get acceptance of Nicea in the East  Its final acceptance was
based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians Gregory of Nyssa and
Gregory of Nazianzus among others  While starting with three
they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one
must think of them as being a single God  This allowed the Council
of Constantinople in 381 to get wide agreement on the idea of
three hypostatese and one ousia  clh
