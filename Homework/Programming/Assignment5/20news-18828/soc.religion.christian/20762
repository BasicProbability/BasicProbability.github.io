Hi Christian friends

My name is Joel I have a sister whos 25th birthday is tomorrowShe
used to be on fire for the Lord but somehow for some reason she
became coldshe dont want to associate anymore with her old
christian friendsso I thought maybe some of you could help her
out again by sending her a postcard or card with a little message of
encouragementhand written is okayher address is 3150 Hobart
Ave San Jose Ca 95127

Thank you and God Bless

PS Jesus Christ is LORD 

I have some qualms about postings like this  You might want to
engage in a bit more conversation with Joel before deluging 
someone who doesnt expect it with cards  clh
