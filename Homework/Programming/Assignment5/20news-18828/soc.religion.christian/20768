Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

In article Apr1623180719931879genevarutgersedu phs431dvaxcccmonasheduau writes
But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a
nonexistent danger  Analogies can only push an argument so far on both
sides  Both Melindas and yours assume the premises used to set up your
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise

The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from
Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right
and duty to tell the TRUTH to all  

Christians can get offended if others do not believe what is selfevidently
to them the TRUTH Nonchristians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get
offended at them because they christians claim to know the TRUTH

The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true because the 
question under discussion is not truth but arrogance 

A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood 
transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are 
Jehovahs Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood 
transfusion The doctors efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood 
transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as 
Christians could be perceived to be arrogant

The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary 
to save the life of the child is irrelevant here What matters is that the 
doctor BELIEVES it to be true and could be seen to be trying to foce his 
beliefs on the parents and this could well be perceived as arrogance
