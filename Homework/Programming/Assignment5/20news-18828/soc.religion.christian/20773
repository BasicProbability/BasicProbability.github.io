Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

Ive just read Carols response and I just had to get into this  Ive
got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
what they say  They are 2 Peter 12021 2 Timothy 31617 and
Galatians 11112  

Also based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges
people if they follow him see Acts 172931 and John 52127 and that
those who reject Jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
see John 124750 then Jesus words are true and do not need
interpretation nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word
if it had to be interpreted
