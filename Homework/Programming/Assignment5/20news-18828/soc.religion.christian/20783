Subject Re Hell2  Black Sabbath

Hey

I may be wrong but wasnt Jeff Fenholt part of Black Sabbath  Hes a
MAJOR brother in Christ now  He totally changed his life around and
he and his wife go on tours singing witnessing and spreading the
gospel for Christ  I may be wrong about Black Sabbath but I know he
was in a similar band if it wasnt that particular group

HOW GREAT IS TH LOVE THE FATHER HAS LAVISHED ON US THAT WE SHOULD BE
CALLED CHILDREN OF GOD  AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE  1 JOHN 31

Grace and peace to all Ill see you ALL Someday
