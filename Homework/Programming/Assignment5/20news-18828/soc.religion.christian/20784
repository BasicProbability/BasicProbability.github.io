On the question Does God hear the prayers of sinners we need to
distinguish
If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned we
make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries
ago
But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner of someone
who says Lord I want you to do this for me but dont expect me
to change my way of life that is a different matter 

I have no doubt that God hears everybodys prayers
However He does things His way ie things will happen
only if it is His will

Now if the question really is Does God grant everybodys wishes 
then youll get a brutal shot of reality similar to when you didnt
get that toy you wanted for Christmas You just cannot expect
to get everything you want in this world
