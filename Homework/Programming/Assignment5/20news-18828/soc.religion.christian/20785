Subject Re When are two people married in Gods eyes

In article Apr1623152719931836genevarutgersedu cs89mcdbrunelacuk Michael C Davis writes

 I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
 couple become married in Gods eyes  Some say that if the two have
 publically announced their plans to marry have made their vows to God and
 are unswervingly committed to one another I realize this is a subjective
 qualifier they are marriedjoined in Gods sight

The way I read Scripture a couple becomes married when they are physically
married ie when they first have sexual intercourse

Some years ago an Anglican synod was discussing the marriage canons and 
there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage

The bishop of Natal whose wife of many years had died and who had recently 
remarried announced It MUST be consummated and looked like that cat that 
got the cream

So I suppose he at least would agree with you
