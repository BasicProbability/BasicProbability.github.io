 I think its really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
 man even if he did claim to be the son of God andor a prophet

Ill pose a question here thats got me thinking  what distinguishes
true religion from cults Im speaking generally here not specifially
about Christianity  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on 
Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question  Basically he said that
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person
But then Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity
IS the person of Jesus  So what distinguishes for example the
Branch Davidian cult from the Presbyterian church  Doctrinal
differences dont answer the question IMHO so dont use them as
an answer

   Scott at Brandeis

	But God demonstrates His     The Lord bless you and keep you
	 own love for us in that      the Lord make His face shine on you
	 while we were yet sinners    and be gracious to you
	 Christ died for us	       the Lord lift up His countenance on you
				       and give you peace
		 Romans 58 NASB		 Numbers 62426 NASB

There have been some attempts to characterize cult  Most commonly
it uses characteristics involving high pressure brainwashing
techniques etc  But some people characterize it by doctrinal
error  In the end Im afraid it becomes a term with no precise
meaning thats used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy
of serious consideration  That doesnt mean that there arent
groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious
doctrinal errors  But past discussions have not suggested to me
that cult is a very helpful term  clh
