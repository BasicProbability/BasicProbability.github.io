Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

 Ive just read Carols response and I just had to get into this  Ive
 got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
                        
 what they say  
  
Joe just cause you say they arent subject to interpretation doesnt
necesarily make it so  Thats your interpretation of these texts

 They are 2 Peter 12021 2 Timothy 31617 and
 Galatians 11112  

2 Peter 12021
But know this first of all that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter 
of ones own interpretation for no prophecy was ever made by an act of
human will but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God

The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20
Apparantly its not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you

2 Timothy 31617
All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching for
reproof for correction for training in righteousness that the man of
God may be adequate equipped for every good work

Galations 11112
For I would have you know brethren that the gospel which was preached
by me is not according to man  For I neither received it from man 
nor was I taught it but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus
Christ

When I read these passages it was not immediately clear to me what
every phrase meant  I had stop and think about the possible
connotations of words what the intent of the author may have been
wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the 
same meaning I had to interpret  If you want to believe that your 
are not interpreting Scripture as you read theres probably nothing 
I can say to change your mind  But I think its naive to think that 
our culture experiences education do not affect everything we read

 Also based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges
 people if they follow him see Acts 172931 and John 52127 and that
 those who reject Jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
 see John 124750 then Jesus words are true and do not need
 interpretation nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word
 if it had to be interpreted

In college I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation  Go to
any Christian bookstore there are scores of books on interpreting and
understanding Scripture  If interpretation is unnecessary there are 
an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time 
and energy on it
