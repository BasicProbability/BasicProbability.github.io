 Muslims i fear have been given a lie from the  
fater of lies Satan They need Christ as do us all

my opinions are my own you may borrow them

just picked out this one point because it struck me
why do you believe this  muslims believe in many of the same things
that christians and jews believe they believe jesus while not the
messiah is a prophet  this seems to me to be much closer to
christianity than other religions are  then again i tend to be
somewhat liberal about others beliefs

this also relates to the serbian ethnic cleansing question  i have
been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few  HOW
can we stand by and watch innocent people even people whose beliefs
we condemn if this is the case and dont get me wrong the things
fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil be
tortured raped the stories about that made me physically ill and
killed  jesus loves all not just those who love him back  and he
would advocate kindness toward them in the hopes of converting them
if thats the way you want to put it rather than killing them  

im sorry i got off the subject here  maybe i should have used a
different title  i did need to get this off my chest however

peace shalom

I am also worried about this issue  Ive made a posting under my own
name earlier today  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs
here  This isnt the right group for it  Their beliefs about Jesus
appear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible  This means that
while they honor him what they think he did and stood for differs in
many ways from Christian beliefs about him  But Moslem beliefs are
an appropriate topic for socreligionislam

As Im sure you know many Christians believe that you must accept
Christ in order to be saved  While Stanleys comment appears to be
antiMoslem I would assume he would say the same thing about all
religions other than Christianity
