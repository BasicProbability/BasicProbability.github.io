From FSSPRacad3alaskaedu Hardcore Alaskan
Subject Looking for videotapes

I have been looking at some of the recent productions on homosexuality
and decided that I was interested in videotaped copies of these  If
anyone can help me out here I would very much appreciate it

Here is what I am looking for

  The Gay Agenda produced by Ty Beesons group The Report

  John Ankerbergs recent series Understanding Homosexuality and
Experiencing Genuine Change

  James Kennedys special on homosexuality which aired this week
and the portion of the previous weeks program which discussed The
Gay Agenda

I will not pay money for copies since this is copyrighted material
and that would be illegal  I will pay for return postage  If
somebody can think of something they would desire in trade please let
me know and Ill see what I can do

Oh BTW Im watching the March On Washington right now on CSPAN 
Other than the fact that Im generally repulsed by what Im watching
I found one thing of interest  General David Dinkins just finished
speaking and remarked that the New York City delegation consists of
about 200000 people  Funny I dont see 200000 people out there
period  Mustve been quite the party scene last night  Or maybe
their exaggerations were just too much

I dont suppose youd be interested in hearing about the homosexual
agenda from homosexual Christians  These portrayals of the homosexual
agenda are regarded by some as being somewhat akin to trying to
understand fundamentalist Christianity by looking at the Branch
Dividians  You might also want to look at some outside evaluations of
the groups claiming to change homosexuals  When our church the
Presbyterian Church USA looked into this issue even the
conservative members of the committee were concerned about how real
and longlasting the changes were  Ill be interested to get reports
from police and the press about the number of people participating
today  Presumably well have a better idea by tomorrow  clh
