   If you reject the claims of Jesus and still go to
   heaven then the jokes on me If you reject him and go to hell
   thats no joke but it will be final

If this is Gods attitude then Ill think Ill go along with
Terry Pratchetts religious philosophy

Oh I believe in God I just dont actually like the blighter
