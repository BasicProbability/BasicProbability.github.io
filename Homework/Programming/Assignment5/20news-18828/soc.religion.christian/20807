Id be fascinated to see such evidence please send me your article
On the negative side however I suspect that any such simplistic link
    abstinenceeducation  decreased pregnancy
    contraceptiveeducation  increased pregnancy
is false  The US which Id guess has one of the largest proportion of 
nonliberal sex education in the western world also has one of the highest
teenage pregnancy rates  Please correct me if my guess is wrong

Ive sent the article  In terms of the group discussion I wanted to point
out that nonliberal education head in the sand is not the same as
abstinence education

We had nonliberal education regarding drugs when I was a kid in the 60s
which didnt do us a lot of good  But abstinence education regarding
drugs has proven effective I think
