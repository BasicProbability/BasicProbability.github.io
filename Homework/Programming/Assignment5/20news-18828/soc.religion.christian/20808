down these distinctions  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek there
is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female  If
Moslems do not know him we may preach to them but we dont kill


As a muslim spelled sometimes as Moslem I must say that Muslims strong
ly believe in Jesus  Refered in islamic text as eesauas

         Jesus   J  esu   s     esu pronounced eeesaw

Yah we knew him well  Ideally this war should not even be  And even in
a time of war our goal is peace  We should try to refrain from viloating
the peace of others as then if we do violate we will not have peace in
ourselves  I dont like this war eaither  It is a conflict of territory
Croats Muslims and Serbs lived together before in peace  The rallying
point is race  And Im sure that there is a General out there who wouldnt
mind being a president

From a Christian perspective Moslem ideas about Jesus look rather
seriously erroneous  Ive generally tried to avoid discussions of
Islam in this group since socreligionislam is the right place for
that  Thus I dont much want to go into detail  I will simply note
that Moslems reject most of what Christians regard as the most
essential facts about Jesus  So at least from a Christian perspective
Moslems dont know Jesus  Again this is no justification for
Christians to hate Moslems or to kill them  I agree with you that
this war should never be  clh
