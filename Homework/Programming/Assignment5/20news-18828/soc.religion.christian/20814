The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly

more accusations about a worldwide conspiracy against blacks

Since Jesus was born in the Middle East then I expect his human
features to be similar to Middle Easterners at that point in time
And since the camera wasnt invented yet we can only guess what 
he looked like For example with all the dinosaur bones were
digging up we still dont know if they were yellowpolkadotted
or purplishorange 8 Likewise I dont think anybody has a 
picture of Jesus is there  8  So our current image of 
Jesus is our best guess

Okay So lets assume that Jesus is black Would that make you
follow His techings  Cause if you follow His teachings skin 
color becomes a moot point anyway What counts more in your
life  Your faith in Jesus or His skin color as a human 

In the interest of historical accuracy however since Jesus
was from Israel wouldnt His skin color be like any other Jew 
ie fairskinned  Although probably heavily tanned from the
desert sun  Experts in this area speak up  cause Im not 8
