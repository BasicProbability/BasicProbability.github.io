  For example why does the universe exist at all  
 
 Must there be a why to this  I ask because of what you also
      assume about God namely that He just exists with no why
      to His existence  So the question is reversed Why cant
      we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to
      just exist  Why must there be a why to the universe

Whether there is a why or not we have to find it This is Pascals wager
If there is no why and we spend our lives searching then we have merely
wasted our lives which were meaningless anyway If there is a why and we
dont search for it then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives
Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old and suppose it lasts another
5 billion years Suppose I live to be 100 That is nothing that is so small
that it is scary So by searching for the why along with my friends here
on earth if nothing else we arent so scared

What if you woke up at a party with no memory and everyone was discussing
who the host might be There might not be a host you say I say lets go
find him the partys going to be over sometime maybe hell let us stay

Because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the why

 
 Well then Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Hinduism Judaism
      Zoerasterism Shintoism and Islam should fit this bit of logic
      quite nicely   All have depth all have enduring values
      thus all must be true

This is a good point But more of a good point for studying religion
than ignoring it Some Christians disagree with me but it is worthwhile
to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from
them To quote of course out of context Test everything and keep what is
true
