Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

In a previous article mhsulonestarutsaedu Melinda  Hsu says


Well the argument usually stops right there  In the end
arent we all just kids groping for the truth  If so do we have
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as
false


If I dont think my belief is right and everyone elses belief is wrong
then I dont have a belief This is simply what belief means Where does
the authority for a belief come from Nowhere for a belief is itself
authoratative If I produce authority for a belief where will I find
authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority In short 
the mind has to start somewhere By the way the majority of Christians
ie Catholics believe in the authority of the Church and derive the
authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church
