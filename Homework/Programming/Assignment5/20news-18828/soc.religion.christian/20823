From tedrathenacsugaedu Ted Kalivoda
Subject Rom 911 article readyrequests

A section of Richard Badenas book Christ The End of the Law Romans 1014 
in Pauline Perspective  The section I have is on the Contextual setting and 
meaning of Romans 911  In addition there are 111 endnotes

Since the file is so long and because of other reasons I will take requests
for the article personally

Of course I believe Badenas insights to be true and quite damaging to the
traditional AugustinianCalvinist view
