 Firstly I am an atheist I am not posting here as an immature flame

 We are just animals  We need sleep food and we reproduce  And we
 die      
 
 I am glad that I am not an atheist  It seems tragic that some people 
 choose a meaningless existence  How terrible to go on living only 
 because one fears death more than life

      Huh Okay so Im not Eric Molas but even if that is how he
feels about life I disagree with it

      Life to me is definitely NOT meaningless it has precisely the
purpose and meaning I choose to give it I go on living because I like
living if I needed any further reason Id be free  completely free 
to pick any reason that suited me That freedom can be almost
intoxicating its probably the closest Ive ever been to a religious
experience Im very glad I am an atheist I wouldnt be anything
else

 I feel so sorry for Eric and 
 yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
 further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity    

      Not unless in explaining your own subjective experience you also
try to convert him or proselytize Merely explaining the effects you
personally experience religion as having on you is not infectious
Not unless Eric is paranoid that is 

 As a Christian I am free to be a human person  I think love choose 
 and create  I will live forever with God

      Whatever floats your goat You sound happy enough thats fairly
much all that matters right

 Christ is not a kind of drug  Drugs are a replacement for Christ  

      Erh Pardon but it strikes me that sentence sounds reversible

 Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
 do something to ease the pain

      Empty spot Godshaped hole I hear such things a lot from
theists never quite did understand what they were talking about
I have no such emptiness or hole Maybe some others do I wouldnt
know but I dont and if I did Id seek help about it Doesnt sound
like a mentally healthy situation at all walking around with a hole
in oneself

 Thank you Eric for your post  It has helped me to appreciate how much 
 God has blessed me  I hope that you will someday have a more joyfilled 
 and abundant life

      Well not having written that original post I dont know if it
was intended to be interpreted in such a way but having reread it
carefully I somewhat doubt it At least thats not how he gets across
to me your mileage may vary
