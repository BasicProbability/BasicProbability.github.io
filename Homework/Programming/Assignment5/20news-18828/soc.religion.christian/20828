Greetings

Probably a tired old horse but  maybe with a slightly different
twist  I wanted to know if there are any good Englishlanguage texts
for learning ancient Hebrew and how these compare with German
educational texts qualitywise if anybody has an idea  I cant figure
out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to
the US

Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the
fact that the students get their ancient languagelearning out of the
way early Im not a theology student but I spend a lot of time with
such folks in their careers  They take the first two years or so to just
do Greek and Latin and Hebrew possibly Aramaic toowho knows
Whats it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States  Is
there a lot of language instruction done  I really dont have a basis
for comparison

Regards Phil

For better of worse we dont have the tradition of classical
education in the US so generally if a seminary believes students
should know Greek they have to teach it  Its common for seminaries
to require at least a semester each of Hebrew and Greek though of
course more is required for serious scholarship  clh
