Subject Re When are two people married in Gods eyes

I think it was Lewis who said that in a wedding its the principals  
that marry each other the church and the state are present merely as  
witnesses


Rob Steele                 In coming to understand anything 
MIT Lincoln Laboratory    we are rejecting the facts as they
244 Wood St M203       are for us in favour of the facts
Lexington MA  02173      as they are    
6179812575                              CS Lewis

This is not just Lewis  its a summary of standard Catholic
theology  However this doesnt mean that the presence of those
witnesses is optional except in odd situations like the standard
desert island  clh
