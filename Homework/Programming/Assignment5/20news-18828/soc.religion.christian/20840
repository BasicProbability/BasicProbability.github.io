Subject Re quality of Catholic liturgy

Tim Rolfe writes

   without active participation  If you know the Latin one really
   beautiful way to hear the Passion is its being chanted by three
   deacons  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range Jesus chants
   in the bass and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor

I heard the Gregorian chant of the Passion on Good Friday  In this
liturgy our Lord is definitely very sad  Its as if He has
resigned Himself to die for these poor pitiful creatures who are
killing Him

The chant is quite beautiful
