Hello I am about to embark on a bible study on ACTS I have online
bible software with me I would like to know the the background of the
authors of its various topics articles and about the author of the
Peoples New Testament I need to know how realible is the articles in
the Online Bible software Specifically for your convenience I want to
know about the 


               1 Darby Translation  I have never heard of this one

JN Darby was one of the founders of the Plymouth Brethren and an
early supporter of dispensationalism  FF Bruce highly approved
of his translation  He also translated the Bible into several other
languages

               2 Youngs Literal Translation I have also never heard
of

This was from the same fellow who did Youngs Concordance which was
a standard reference work similar to Strongs concordance

               3 The realiability of the HebrewGreek Lexicon

I believe that these just follow standard reference works

               4 The authors from which denomination etc of the
articles in the TOPICS modules

Some are by Larry Pierce Brethren some are by Baptists and I
think that Thompson of chain reference fame was Presbyterian

               5 The realiability of the Treasury of Scripture
Knowlege  as I have never heard of too 

Another standard reference work that has been around for decades
A new version was just released and is available through Christian
Book Distributers

               6 Who are the commentators Scofield and BW Johnson
who wrote the Scofield Reference Bible and the Peoples New Testament respectively 

CI Scofield was the creator of the Scofield Reference Bible  For many
people but not me this is THE STUDY BIBLE  The notes are strongly
dispensational

               7 The realiability of the Strong numbers

These are probably the most accurate Strongs numbers available
