doctrine


                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD


I   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD
     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture this is the most
     important  The Bible is preeminently a revelation of God 
     Therefore our first objective in studying the Bible should
     be to know God
     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three
     Persons in the Godhead Trinity  God the Father God the
     Sonthe Lord Jesus Christ and God the Holy Spirit  I
     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in
     nature meaning that They are identical in nature each
     possessing the same divine attributes  They are also
     equally worthy of our worship our trust and our obedience
     Cf Matt2819 2 Cor1314 John 14891617

II  THE ATTRIBUTES or CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GODHEAD
     A  Gods nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for
         Himself Jehovah  He is the living God eternal and
         unchanging  He is without beginning and without
         ending  Cf Isa428
     B  God is a spirit  Cf John 424
     C  God is love  Cf 1 John 4816
         As such He is gracious merciful good faithful
         patient and full of lovingkindness  Cf Psa 8912
         Psa 1038 Nahum 17
     D  But God is also holy and righteous  He is absolutely
         without sin in His nature and so is incapable of
         sinning in though word or action  Cf Ex 1511 Isa
         63
     E  God is omnipresent everywhere present at the same time
         in the completeness of His Person omniscient all
         knowing knowing all thingsthe end from the beginning
         infinitely wise omnipotent almighty sovereign with
         unlimited power over all creation
         God is infinite in His presence wisdom and power  It
         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day
         has become very mancentered and that the people in our
         churches know very little about God  I believe that the
         Lords work needs to be Godcentered and that the
         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign
         in all things  in the affairs of nations in the lives
         of all people and in the carrying out of His purposes
         regarding salvation

III     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD
     A  In creation
          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in
          creating and all Three are active in sustaining
          creation and in ordering the course of human affairs
          for nations as well as individual people to the end
          of time  Cf Gen 112 John 113 Col 11617
          Heb 13
     B  In salvation
         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is
         absolutely necessary to begin with God not with man 
         All three Persons of the Godhead have been and are
         active in salvation
         1  God the Father
             Salvation originated with God  The Members of the
             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would
             be salvation the conditions under which people
             could and would be saved and even who would be
             saved  Election to salvation is recognized in
             Scripture as the work of  God the Father  Cf Eph
             134 2 Thess 21314
         2  Christ the Son of God
             The Lord Jesus Christ through His birth by the
             virgin Mary came to the earth to accomplish two
             important works
             a   He came as the final and complete revelation of
                  God the Father  Cf Col 115 heb 113
             b   He came to provide salvation for all whom the
                  Father had chosen  He did this by His death on
                  the Cross by His bodily resurrection and by
                  His present intercessory work in heaven  The
                  work of salvation will be completed for us when
                  the Lord returns  Cf Rom 5810 1 Cor 153
                  4 Heb 725 1 John 32
         3  The Holy Spirit
             As the Author of Scripture the theme of which is
             Christ and His redemptive work the Holy Spirit is
             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the
             following ways
             a   He convicts of sin Cf John 16711
             b   He regenerates known in the Bible as the new
                  birth  Cf John 358
             c   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work
                  of sanctification  Cf John 141617
             d   He seals every believer in Christ thus making 
                  salvation secure  Cf Eph 11314
             e   He baptizes every believer into the body of
                  Christ  Cf Cor 1213
             f   He teaches every believer the truth of
                  Scripture Cf John 1426
             g   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of 
                  God for ministry  Cf 1 Cor 12
             h   He restrains sin  Cf Gal 51626
             i   He empowers for living and for service  
                  Cf Acts 18
