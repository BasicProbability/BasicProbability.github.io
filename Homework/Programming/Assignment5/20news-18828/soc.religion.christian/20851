Subject Re phone number of wycliffe translators UK


  Im concerned about a recent posting about WBTSIL  I thought theyd
pretty much been denounced as a rightwing organization involved in
ideological manipulation and cultural interference including Vietnam
and South America A commission from Mexican Academia denounced them in
1979 as  a covert political and ideological institution used by the
US govt as an instrument of control regulation penetration espionage and
repression
  My concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even
praiseworthy by readers of socreligionchristian Its important that
Christians dont immediately accept every Christian organization as
automatically above reproach

                                                                  mp
