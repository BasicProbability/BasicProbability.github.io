Subject Esotericism

Im compiling a bibliography on religious perspectives on esotericism
hermeticism gnosticism mysticism occultism alchemy and magic and
am interested in sources that others have found particularly interesting
and insightful  Im especially interested in medieval works such as
The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz and Arthurian legends

Please feel free too to send personal opinions on any of the above
pro or con or anywhere in between  Thanks much
