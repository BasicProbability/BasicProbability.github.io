Subject quality of Catholic liturgy

I appreciated the followups and replies to my earlier query  One reply which
I have lost suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses one 
of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan  By coincidence last weeks
America the national Jesuit magazine carried an interview with Fr Myles 
Bourke Corpus Christis pastor emeritus  Fr Bourke also directed the NT 
translation in the New American Bible  He noted certain practices have 
been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality 
and sometimes of hilarity has trivialized the liturgy  I note that at my 
parents parish on Easter helium filled balloons were distributed at the 
offertory apparently to aid in understanding the word risen  This was not a 
kiddie mass either but the wellattended 1100 Mass

I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies  This newsgroup as a
whole offers generally moderate perhaps because its moderated conversation
on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior including myself
Sometimes people do go over the top but the remarkable thing is how that is
the exception I think  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted  It seems
soChristian
