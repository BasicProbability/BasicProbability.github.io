desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah  If
the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this
cup pass from him  Was this out of weakness  NEVER  Many men and
women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes
Is Jesus less than these  No he is not  He knew the crucification
was NOT the will of GOD  Gods will was that the Jewish people accept
Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on
the earth with Jesus as its head Just like the Jewish people
expected If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what
	
	
	

Why do you assume that Jesuss plea to His Father to let this cup
pass from Him was merely a plea to escape death  When I look at
Jesus in the garden I see a ManGod who all His life had had the
presense of His Father with Him  As a result He knew every
detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden  But
as that hour approached He felt abandoned by His Father His
presense diminishing with each passing minute  In addition it
was brought more and more to Jesuss attention the betrayal of
Judas was probably a big impact that His suffering would be to no
avail for many people especially those who would reject Him not
only then but in the future  I truly believe that the majority of
Jesuss suffering was mental and spiritual while the physical
portion was only the tip of the iceburg

BTW we know from Johns account that Jesus shunned becomming an earthly
king  From John

JOH 614    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did they
            began to say Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the
            world
JOH 615    Jesus knowing that they intended to come and make him king by
            force withdrew again to a mountain by himself

This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an
earthly king  No Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all Jew 
Gentile people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those
who would believe  This was utterly mistaken much to Jesuss
dismay as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom  But He knew
what His Fathers will was and followed it obediently even in the
darkness of His Passion
