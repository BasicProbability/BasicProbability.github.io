I would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged
couple become married in Gods eyes 

Not if they are unwilling to go through a public marriage ceremony
nor if they say they are willing but have not actually done so

Lets distinguish real logistical problems like being stranded on a
desert island from excuses such as waiting for soandsos brother
to come back from being in the army so he can be in the ceremony

I disagree  People marry each other  When they commit fully to each
other as life partners they are married  The ceremony may assist in
emphasizing the depth of such a commitment but is of itself nothing
God knows our hearts  He knows when two have committed themselves to
be one he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully
giving ourselves to another  The way I see it youd have to be living
together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone
knew if a marriage really existed but God knows  I dont think God keeps
a scorebook
