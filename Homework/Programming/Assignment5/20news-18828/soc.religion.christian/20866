Subject RADIO FREE THULCANDRA  was Dungeons  Dragons An authors view

There was a recent discussion of Dungeons and Dragons and other role
playing games  Since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and
science fiction and fantasy fans I will mention that I am the editor
and publisher of RADIO FREE THULCANRA a Christianoriented science
fiction fanzine  It is not a Christian magazine with a special
interest in science fiction  It is a science fiction fanzine with a
special interest in Christianity  Gaming is not a major topic of
discussion but it has come up in some letters  No there are no
arguments about whether DD is satanic  People who think it is are
not likely to be reading RFT  Anyway I am now working on the April
issue  I will send a sample copy to any reader of
socreligionchristian who requests it  It is printed on paper so
requests should include a snailmail address
