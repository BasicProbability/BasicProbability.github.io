Subject Re Being right about messiahs

Jesus isnt God  When Jesus returns some people may miss Him   What version of
the Bible do you read Mike 

Jesus is God incarnate in flesh  Jesus said I and the Father are one 
Jesus was taken up to heaven after His 40 day postresurrection stint and the
angels who were there assured the apostles that Jesus would return the same way
and that everyone will see the coming Thats why Jesus warned that many would
come claiming to be Him but that we would know when Jesus actually returns 

These are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve
