Hello Im back

I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response be
it a positive or negative one I read EVERY letter and thought about 
each one 

I got all sorts of responses from marry her to have nothing ever to 
do with her again

Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer here is what I have
decided to do

I sent her a letter today First i told her that if she was really serious
about moving away from home to another state that I would do anything to 
get you here in NC I told her that I tried to find out if there were 
any new stores planning to be builtbut they wouldnt tell me

About her marraige comment Im not gonna call it a proposal cause
I still dont know if it was a total joke or not I more or less said
that Marry me Well get transferred to NC first and then well talk  

Hopefully what i said could be interpreted either way

Needless to say there has been a lot of praying over thisI 
have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible If
she was dead serious about getting marriedI wouldnt do it
yet simply bc she is not as far as I know to this point a Christian
It just wouldnt work wo God in the marraige as well I figure
that if God wanrs this to go throughhes kept us in touch for 10 
years nowhe can handle one more If God wants it to happen it
will happen

She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so Ill get to 
see herand Ill get a letter from her befoe then so I know
more of what to look forward to

I guess all I can do now is wait and pray I have decided not to tell
my folks until Im totally sure what is going on

I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation
in your prayers

Finally I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in

If you have anything else for meI will be at this email address
for one week Please tell me anyhting you wantIm curious
how folks think about what i did


Thanx

Chris
