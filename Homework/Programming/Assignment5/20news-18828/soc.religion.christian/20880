Subject Serbian genocide Work of God

Are the Serbs doing the work of God  Hmm

Ive been wondering if anyone would ever ask the question

Are the governments of the United States and Europe not moving
to end the ethnic cleansing by the Serbs because the targets are
muslims

CanDoes God use those who are not following him to accomplish
tasks for him  Esp those tasks that are punative
