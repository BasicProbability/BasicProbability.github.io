Subject Goodbye but not forever

Praise God  Im writing everyone to inform you that I have been
accepted to the Doctor of Psychology program at Fuller Theological
Seminary in Pasadena CA  Ive been working long and hard to try to
get in there and have said many hours of prayer  Im very excited for
this opportunity but also very nervous about it

Id appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation
for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student  Id also
appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have 
about Fuller Pasadena or California in general like good places to
have fun good churches to check out or anything else that might be
good for me to know  Also if anyone knows of any foundations that 
might have funding or scholarship money available please let me know
Of course if you wish to make a personal contribution

The contract for my current job is over at the end of April  Ill be
taking a couple classes at UT this summer and then Ill be moving to
Pasadena  Hopefully Ill be able to get netaccess next fall although
Fuller doesnt have it itself

Ive enjoyed the interesting discussions and I commend everyone for their
earnest search to please God  Thanks to our moderator for providing
such a wonderful service and in doing a great job of running this news
group

May God bless you all  Vaya con Dios mi amigas y amigos

Paul
