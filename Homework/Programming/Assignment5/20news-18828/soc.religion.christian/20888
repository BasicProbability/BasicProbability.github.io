Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

If I dont think my belief is right and everyone elses belief is wrong
then I dont have a belief This is simply what belief means

Unfortunatly this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when
it comes to their religion Some take it to the extreme and say that
their religion is the ONLY one and if you dont accept their teachings
then you wont be saved It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim
to know what God thinkswants Especially when its based upon your
interpretation of a book The logic in the above statement is faulty
in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs cant both be
correct Its all about perception No two people are exactly alike
No two people perceive everything in the same way I believe that
there is one truth Call it Gods truth a universal truth or call it
what you will I dont believe God presents this truth I think it is
just there and its up to you to look for and see it through prayer
meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever Just because people may
perceive this truth differently it doesnt mean one is wrong and the
other is right As an example take the question Is the glass half
empty or half full You can have two different answers which are
contradictory and yet both are correct So for your belief to be
true does not require everyone elses belief to be wrong

If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that God
will save only Christians its hard to see how you can criticize them
for arrogance for saying so  It could be that theyre wrong  But I
hardly see that its arrogance  Lets look at this a bit closer
Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught
us things but didnt say anything about exclusivity  If we believe
them and then add and anybody who believes anything else is damned
then you could well criticize us for arrogance  But in this case the
exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets etc  So
we could be wrong in believing it but I dont see how we can be
called arrogant  Maybe the world isnt a soft place  Maybe certain
choices actually do have eternal consequences  I can see calling the
Christian message arrogant in a certain sense though only in the
same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it
doesnt give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a
building  But not Christians for passing it on given that they
believe it  The complaints I can see making are 1 that Christians
are wrong or 2 that God is arrogant  clh
