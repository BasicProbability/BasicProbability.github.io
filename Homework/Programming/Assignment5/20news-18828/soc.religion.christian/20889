following Christ  From Captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict
obedience to the Gensis command to subdue the earth to Nazis who have
justly punished the Jews for the killing Christ

It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated
by certain antiChristians as if Christians have been given a
firm command to destroy the earth You could prove almost
anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible
 its a big book you know I doubt you could find a single
case of a antiecological action taking place specifically
because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief

As for the Nazis they were motivated by German Nationalism
not by Christianity In fact they despised Christianity as a
weak pacifist religion and were much more keen on pagan
glorification of strength and warfare They killed the Jews
because they were not Germans not because they were
Christkillers  they were just as keen on killing the other
nonGerman ethnic minority the Romanies or Gypsies
