Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

In article Apr2200561519932073genevarutgersedu hayesstwrisc1unisaacza Steve Hayes writes

A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood 
transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are 
Jehovahs Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood 
transfusion The doctors efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood 
transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as 
Christians could be perceived to be arrogant

The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary 
to save the life of the child is irrelevant here What matters is that the 
doctor BELIEVES it to be true and could be seen to be trying to foce his 
beliefs on the parents and this could well be perceived as arrogance

Let me carry that a step further  Most doctors would not claim to be 
infallible  Indeed they would generally admit that they could conceivably
be wrong eg that in this case a blood tranfusion might not turn out to 
be necessary after all  However the doctors would have enough confidence
and conviction to claim out of genuine concern that is IS necessary  As
fallible human beings they must acknowledge the possibility that they are
wrong  However they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable
and stand by their convictions
