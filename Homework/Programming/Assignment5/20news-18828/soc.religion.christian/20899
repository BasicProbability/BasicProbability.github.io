Subject Re DID HE REALLY RISE

In article Apr15005818199328885athosrutgersedu oserfermiwustledu Scott Oser writes

And the two simplest refutations are these

1  What impact  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament
I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate and that
the recorded impact actually happened  I find it interesting that no other
contemporary source records an eclipse an earthquake a temple curtain
being torn etc  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection
is from the Pauline epistles none of which were written sooner than 20 years
after the supposed event

First off Id say that the impact if right before your eyes 8 That we are
even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself Further the early
church bears testimony to the impact

2  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no
one knew where it was  I personally believe that the most likely
explanation was that the body was stolen by disciples or by graverobbers
Dont bother with the point about the guards  it only appears in one
gospel and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make
up in order to counter the graverobbing charge  The New Testament does
record that Jews believed the body had been stolen  If there were really
guards they could not have effectively made this claim as they did

Of course they knew where it was Dont forget that Jesus was seen by both
the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker Pilate was no fool and didnt 
need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus body to 
make it appear He had arisen Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a 
man well know to the Sanhedrin to say that they didnt know where He was
buried begs the question

Now you say that you think that the disciples stole the body But think on
this a moment Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a 
deliberate lie If not then why do you think the disciples would Now Im
not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth 
but unbeknown to you it is a lie Many have done this No Im talking about
dying by beheading stoning crucifixion etc for something you know to
be a lie Thus you position with regards to the disciples stealing the 
body seems rather lightweight to me

As for graverobbers why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over 
the body of Jesus He wasnt buried with great riches So again this is
an argument that can be discounted

That leaves you back on square one What happened to the body

Again let me comment that the most plausible nonChristian scenario
and the one typically suggested by sceptics who are knowledgeable
about the NT is that the resurrection was a subjective event and the
empty tomb stories are a result of accounts growing in the telling
