Subject Re  Hell 

In article Apr12034424199318836athosrutgersedu dmnkeplerunhedu Theres a seeker born every minute writes

    That would depend on what Heaven is like If God is a King and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King
I might opt for Hell I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to

But then on the other hand if you really loved that King more
than you did yourself and He loved you to the point of assuring
you that the eternal time spent with him would be eternal ecstasy
would you really opt for that choice
