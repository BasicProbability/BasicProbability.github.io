 Suppose you were part of the Christian consipracy which was going to  
 tell people that Christ had risen  Never mind the stoning the being  
 burned alive the possible crucifixion  lets just talk about a  
 scourging  The whip that would be used would have broken pottery metal  

No one was ever flogged beaten burned fed to the lions or killed in any
other way because of a belief in the resurrection  sorry to disappoint you

I think you are vastly oversimplifying things We know that early Christians
suffered totures because of their witness to Christ  For example

ACT 540    His speech persuaded them They called the apostles in and had
            them flogged Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of
            Jesus and let them go

ACT 541    The apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been
            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name

It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion
to even hearing Jesuss name
ACT 528    We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name he said
            Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are
            determined to make us guilty of this mans blood

Finally the first apostles death James of Zebedee was certainly
not by Romes hand any more than the first martyr Stephen 


The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
forms in the religions of antiquity  The problem was not the resurrection
which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population 

The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection then one
must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He
stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth  That would
have been extremely difficult for some people especially those
that had plotted to kill Him
