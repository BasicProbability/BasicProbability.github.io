Subject Re Hebrew grammar textschoose English or German

Phil Sells writes

 Probably a tired old horse but  maybe with a slightly different
 twist  I wanted to know if there are any good Englishlanguage texts
 for learning ancient Hebrew and how these compare with German
 educational texts qualitywise if anybody has an idea  I cant figure
 out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to
 the US

My impression is that for advanced work you will be much better off with
German reference works lexicons concordances especially  For a firsttime
encounter my personal preference would be to deal with a textbook written in
my native language  But if you know German and are in Germany pick up all the
reference books you think you can handle  I only know these works by
reputation since my German is most rusty but Id look at the following books
Koehlers lexicon Mandelderns concordance the Jenni  Westermann theological
dictionary of the OT

 Whats it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States  Is
 there a lot of language instruction done  I really dont have a basis
 for comparison

The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely
mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school  Presbyterian
and Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical
languages than others  Of course any divinity school that has a doctoral
program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources  But
there are quite a few mastersdegreegranting seminaries here at which the
attitude seems to be more Well if youre really interested well give you
a semesterlong course but we dont understand why   

The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for firstyear
students to take intensive fiveweek introductory language courses in each
language followed by semesterlong exegesis courses  That is Hebrew in
August OT exegesis in the fall Greek in January NT exegesis in the spring 
These courses are required for graduation a third or a half of the students
Id say take advanced biblical work that requires language work
