Subject Why religion and which religion


        My family has never been particularly religious  singing Christmas
carols is about the limit for them Thus Ive never really believed in God and
heaven although I dont actually believe that they dont exist either 
Im sort of undecided probably like a lot of people I guess
        Lately Ive been thinking about it all a lot more and I wondered how
religious people can be so convinced that there is a God I feel as though
I want to believe but Im not used to believing things without proof 
just as I cant believe that there definitely isnt a God so I cant
definitely believe that there is I wondered if most of you were brought up by
religious families and never believed any different Can anyone help me to
understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong

        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is
correct How do you choose a religion and how do you know that the Christian
God exists and the Gods of other religions dont How do you feel about
people who follow other religions How about atheists And people like me 
agnostics I suppose Do you respect their religion and accept their
beliefs as just as valid as your own Isnt there contradiction between
the religions How can your religion be more valid than any others Do
you have less respect for someone if theyre not religious or if they follow
a different religion than you would if they were Christian

        Also how much of the scriptures are correct Are all events in
the bible really supposed to have happened or are they just supposed to be
stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave

        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas which I suppose are
fairly universal throughout all religions  not killing stealing etc and
Loving my neighbour for want of a better expression The only part I find
hard is the actual belief in God

        Finally what is Gods attitude to people like me who dont quite
believe in Him but are generally fairly good people Surely not
believing doesnt make me a worse person If not I find myself wondering why
I so strongly want to really believe and to find a religion

        Sorry if I waffled on a bit  I was just writing ideas as they came
into my head Im sure I probably repeated myself a bit too

                        Thanks for the help

Theres been enough discussion about evidence for Christianity
recently that you may prefer to respond to this via email rather than
as a posting  clh
