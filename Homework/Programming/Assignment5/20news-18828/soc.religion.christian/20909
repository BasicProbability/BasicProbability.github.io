Subject Re When are two people married in Gods eyes

In article Apr1623152719931836genevarutgersedu cs89mcdbrunelacuk Michael C Davis writes

it has to do with honoring the laws of the state and
also to do with how people will perceive us ie it is culturally insensitive
to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony

I would go further if a couple are unwilling to have their commitment
publicly witnessed and recorded thats prima facie evidence that the
commitment isnt really there
