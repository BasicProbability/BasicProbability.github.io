Subject Immaterial afterlife was Is Hell Real

In article C4zAyMM9uspsscom goermidwayuchicagoedu writes

I thought everyone who died simply went to Sheol  The notion of going to
heaven is a Christianization based on those parts of the NT that speak of
an immaterial afterlife

Where in the Bible is there any teaching about an immaterial afterlife
I was always taught that both the OT Jews and the NT Christians would
have found the notion incomprehensibleas do I

Dont we christians believe in the resurrection of the body

Or do you mean by material simply the stuff made of the 100 elements
that we know and love too much
