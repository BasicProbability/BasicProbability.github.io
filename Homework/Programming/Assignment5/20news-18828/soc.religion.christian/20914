insert deletion of Pauls and Aarons discourse on anger ref Galatians
51920

I dont know why it is so obvious  We are not speaking of acts of the 
flesh  We are just speaking of emotions  Emotions are not of themselves
moral or immoral good or bad  Emotions just are  The first step is
not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
we hide our true feelings it is to accept ourselves as we are as God
accepts us  

Oh but they definitely can be  Please look at Colossians 3510 and
Ephesians 42527  Emotions can be controlled and God puts very strong
emphasis on selfcontrol otherwise why would he have Paul write to
Timothy so much about making sure to teach selfcontrol 

insert deletion of remainder of paragraph


Rethink it Aaron  Dont be quick to judge  He has forgiven those with
AIDS he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made
appropriate choices for action on such feelings  He has not given in to
his anger

Please rethink and reread for yourself Joe  Again the issue is
selfcontrol especially over feelings and actions for our actions stem
from our feelings in many instances  As for God giving in to his anger
that comes very soon
