	I dont think most people understand what a Christian is  It 
is certainly not what I see a lot in churches  Rather I think it 
should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for Gods 
sake  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the 

	Typical statement from an irrational and brainwashed person
The bible was written by some male chavnist thousands of years ago
as were all of the holy books Follow the parts that you think are
suitable for modern life Ignore the others For heavens  sake dont
take it literally

Please leave heaven out of it  For his own sake I pray that Dan does
take it literally because thats how God intended it to be taken  Dan
your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view
However I have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid
down by the Bible on what it means to be a disciple of Jesus  I have no
clue where wwc is but please mail me  Id really like to get you in
touch with them


same  Hey we cant do it God himself inspires us to turn our lives 
over to him  Thats tuff and most people dont want to do it to be a 
				
real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at  But 

insert deletion of ranting about other religions which obviously has
gone offcenter of Dans original context

Dan Im familiar with this one  Youve got a point though  There are
some who dont want to turn over everything and be a disciple some have
no clue about it because theyve not been taught some have done exactly
that and turned over everything to follow Jesus some are blocked by
difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law
However Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his
disciple in Luke 92326 and Luke 142533  My question is  why do
people ignore the command and treat it as optional  I certainly dont
have an answer to this

	Parting Question
		Would you have become a Christian if you had not
been indoctrinated by your parents You probably never learned about
any other religion to make a comparative study And therefore I claim
you are brain washed

My parents had nothing to do with it  God had and has everything to do
with it  As for these attacking responses I must say that I disagree
with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements
possibly to the point of slander when talking about people not what
they do  Please if you have a response state it instead of flying off
the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with
what is being discussed  Im sure both Dan and I would have a much
happier time with your responses

Joe
