It seems I spend a significant amount of my time correcting errors about
the reliability tests for condoms and abstinence  A few years ago I saw
that famous study that showed a 10 failure rate for condoms  The
same study showed a 20 failure rate for abstinence  That is adult
couples who relied on abstinence to prevent pregnancy got pregnant in
alarming numbersthey didnt have the willpower to abstain  And were
thinking that this will work with high school kids

I am told that Planned ParenthoodSIECUSstyle valuesfree methods that
teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make choices
actually increase pregnancy rates I posted a long article on this a while
back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested  The
article included sources to contact for information on research verifying
these statements and an outstanding source for info on acquiring
abstinencerelated curricula even in singlecopy quantities for home use

The same research produced the results that abstinencerelated curricula
were found to decrease pregnancy rates in teens  I assume that it is
reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy
rate

The difference is not in contraceptive technology but in the values taught
to the children  The PPSIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have
legitimate choices while the abstinence related curricula taught them that
they did not have legitimate choices other than abstinence  It is the
values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of
these kids

Despite the better track record of abstinencerelated curricula they are
suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that
desired  

Question for further discussion as they say in the textbooks  Why dont
we teach safe drug use to kids instead of drug abstinence  Isnt it
because we know that a class in how to use drugs safely if you choose to
use drugs would increase drug use  Why isnt drug abstinence education
barred from schools because it teaches religion  Arent we abandoning
those children who will use drugs anyway and need instruction in their safe
use
