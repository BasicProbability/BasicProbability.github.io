 Drugs are a replacement for Christ
Those who have an empty spot in the Godshaped hole in their hearts must 
do something to ease the pain

I have heard this claim quite a few times Does anybody here know
who first came up with the Godshaped hole business

  This is why the most effective 
substanceabuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples spiritual 
needs

You might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
like this

In 12step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous one of the steps
involves acknowleding a higher power  AA and other 12step abuse
recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective

Unfortunately as evidence for God this can be dismissed by stating
that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes 
people religious and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that
being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict but
still maintain that both are escapism  And I suspect that there
are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to
Christianity

I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ
ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves
as incomplete and needing God the Godshaped hole while atheists
necessarily see themselves as selfsufficient  If the atheists are
right Christians are guilty of being morally weak and too cowardly
to stand up for themselves if the Christians are right the atheists
are guilty of considerable arrogance  I use the term atheist to
refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no God
as opposed to one who does not know andor does not care about God
