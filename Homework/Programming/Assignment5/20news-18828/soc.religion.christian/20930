	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves  God endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations
for example but He did not make that availible to everyone
Does that mean that if Science can override Gods decision
through alterations that God wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children  Should men be allowed to have babies if that
is made possible

  In a word yes  I dont believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of
impact on the power of God  In the past God gave us the ability to create
life through sexual relations  Now he is giving us the ability to create life
through in vitro fertilization  The difference between the two is merely 
cosmetic and even if we gain the ability to create universes we wont begin to
approach the glory of God
  The power we are being given is a test and I am sure that in many cases we
will use our new abilities unwisely  But people have been using sexuality
unwisely for millenia and I havent heard an outcry to abolish it yet
  No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world we arent
impinging on Gods power  Its only when we attempt to gain control of the
spiritual world those things that cant be approached through science and 
logic that we begin to interfere with God
