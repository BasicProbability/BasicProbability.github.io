This is not true  The athiests position is that there is no PROOF of the
existence of God  As much as some people accept their Church their priests
or straight from their own scriptures as the proof this does not 
satisfy atheists

  You havent fully explained the atheist position  Many theists believe that
there is no proof of the existence of God but choose to believe in him
anyway  I havent yet found an argument for atheism that cant quickly be
broken down to unprovable assumptions  This isnt a problem with me everybody
needs to have a faith but if you believe that you can provide a purely 
logical argument for the nonexistence of God Id really like to see it

Are you asking us to believe blindly  You are trying to deny that part of
us that makes us ask the question Does God exist ie selfawareness and
reason  If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant
as the other animals on this earth  Does God want us to be like that

You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything  However if
we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone  And since
we can only use faith why is one picture of God eg Hinduism any less
valid than another eg Christianity

  Ahhbut when you use science and reason you have faith in certain beliefs
of the scientific methodfor example

  The physical laws of the universe are stable
  Our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth
  Objective reality exists
  Logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions
  
  Can you prove any of these
