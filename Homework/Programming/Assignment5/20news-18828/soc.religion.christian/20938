Subject Re Sabbath Admissions 5of5

I find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed 
Then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder  He has
established a twotiered God  One set of rules for the Jews his people
and another set for the saved Gentiles his people  Why would God
discriminate  Does the Jew who accepts Jesus now have to live under the
Gentile rules

God has one set of rules for all his people  Paul was never against the
law  In fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls
the law  Pauls point is germane to both Jews and Greeks  The Law can
never be used as an instrument of salvation  And please do not combine
the ceremonial and moral laws in one

In Matt 51419 Christ plainly says what He came to do and you say He was
only saying that for the Jewss benefit  Your Christ must be a
politician speaking from both sides of His mouth  As Paul said I have
not so learned Christ  Forget all the theology just do what Jesus says
 Your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth far less in
Gods judgement hall
