In a short poem God in His mercy made  the fixed pains of Hell
C S Lewis expresses an idea that Im sure was current among others
but I havent be able to find its source

that even Hell is an expression of mercy because God limits the amount
of separation from Him and hence the amount of agony that one can
achieve


I have also heard it called an expression of mercy because Heaven would be
far more agonizing for those who had rejected God
