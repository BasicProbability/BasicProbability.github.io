Subject Re Atheists and Hell

   Hello

   I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on
 the newsgroup and I think that they can be used to explain each other  
 Unfortunately I dont have direct quotes handy

 1 Atheists believe that when they die they die forever

True to a point  If you were to ask a Buddhist atheist

 2 A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
    is unfair

   I dont see what the problem is  To Christians Hell is by definition 
 eternal deathexactly what atheists are expecting when they die  Theres no
 reason Hell has to be especially awfulto most people eternal death is bad
 enough

Actually yes and no Hell is eternal death  Actually the way 
     Ive had it related to me its more of an eternal damnation
     where sinners will feel the licking flames of Hell  If I
     supposedly can feel these flames I would assume Im still
     alive but suffering and away from God

   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
 the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  Personally I dont think
 that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
 with a doubleedged sword issuing from his mouthI treat both these state
 ments as metaphorical

I believe Jehovahs Witnesses have a similar view where the body
     sleeps for ever

I dont have a problem with being condemned to Hell either  The
     way I see it if God wants to punish me for being honest in
     my skepticism that is for saying he doesnt exist He
     certainly wouldnt be changing His nature  Besides I would
     rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven
     knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being
     scorched for his wrongdoings
