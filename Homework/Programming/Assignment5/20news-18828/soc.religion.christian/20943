I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is
ever disproved 

Didnt Paul write that if the Resurrection is not true we are the
biggest fools of all  However whether you believe in Christ or not
His teachings eg love your brotherman as yourself even if only 
followed at a secular level could do a great deal to alleviate some of 
the problems we see today in the world  Even when I was a rabid atheist 
I couldnt deny that
