 I am told that Planned ParenthoodSIECUSstyle valuesfree methods that
 teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make choices
 actually increase pregnancy rates I posted a long article on this a while
 back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested  

 The same research produced the results that abstinencerelated curricula
 were found to decrease pregnancy rates in teens  I assume that it is
 reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy
 rate

Id be fascinated to see such evidence please send me your article
On the negative side however I suspect that any such simplistic link
    abstinenceeducation  decreased pregnancy
    contraceptiveeducation  increased pregnancy
is false  The US which Id guess has one of the largest proportion of 
nonliberal sex education in the western world also has one of the highest
teenage pregnancy rates  Please correct me if my guess is wrong
