Subject Re Divine providence vs Murphys Law

In article Apr19051328199329224athosrutgersedu rolfejuniordsuedu Tim Rolfe writes
Romans 828 RSV   We know that in everything God works for good with those 
who love him who are called according to his purpose 
Murphys Law  If anything can go wrong it will
We are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on
Murphys Law  But how do we harmonize that with Romans 828  For that
matter how appropriate is humor contradicted by Scripture

	Both Christians and nonChristians laugh at this quote because
it exaggerates something we all feel but know is not true  Us
Christians just KNOW that a little better    



			In God we trust
