Subject Re Atheists and Hell

In article Apr19051408199329279athosrutgersedu atterlepvelaacsoaklandedu Cardinal Ximenez writes

  I dont see what the problem is  To Christians Hell is by definition 
eternal deathexactly what atheists are expecting when they die  Theres no
reason Hell has to be especially awfulto most people eternal death is bad
enough
  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  Personally I dont think
that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
with a doubleedged sword issuing from his mouthI treat both these statements
as metaphorical

Phew That takes a load off I dont want to live forever  I wish
most Christians held this view  You cant walk across campus in
spring without being assailed by fireandbrimstone preachers  I
really think the metaphor should be limited at least with respect to
teaching our children  Its criminal to put these ideas into a young
and trusting mind  Besides why not rely on the positive aspects of
your religion to win their faith
