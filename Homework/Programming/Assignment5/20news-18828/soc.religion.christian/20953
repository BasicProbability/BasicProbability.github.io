  Hello

  I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the 
newsgroup and I think that they can be used to explain each other  
Unfortunately I dont have direct quotes handy

1 Atheists believe that when they die they die forever

 More correctly when people die they cease to exist

2 A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
   is unfair

  I dont see what the problem is  To Christians Hell is by definition 
eternal deathexactly what atheists are expecting when they die

 The idea Ive gotten is that to christians Hell is  like Heaven 
 afterlife ie you dont cease to exist but are subjected to eternal 
 torture well thats the orthodox idea anyway eternal death if you
 prefer that Atheists dont believe in any sort of afterlife

  Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view since
the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such  Personally I dont think
that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus
with a doubleedged sword issuing from his mouthI treat both these state
ments as metaphorical

 I think its safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical Certainly
 not the equivalent of ceasing to exist Some christian concepts are indeed
 metaphors but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation It is of
 course nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview 
 of modern age but I fear the church will not accept it Understandably per
 haps because if you accept that Hell is a metaphor then youre one step
 closer to turning God into a metaphor as well
