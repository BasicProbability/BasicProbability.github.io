 One of the tell tale signsfruits that give nonchristians away  is
when their net replies are acrid angry and sarcastic

We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed born again
christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to
christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were
spiritually hungry  Instead of answering questions with sweetness and
sincerity these chrisitan netwarriors flame the queries
 
Although I certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness is
unloving and ineffective Im a little disturbed by the formulation that
ill temper is not a Christian trait It seems like a false argument to
say that anyone who displays trait X must not be a Christian Could
well be a sinning Christian but a Christian nonetheless
Anger is human and Christians are
human Christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like
everyone else Its not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking
righteousness that marks a dedicated Christian And one of the greatest
gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for
my failures Expecting flawless behavior from self or others isnt
Christianity its perfectionism
