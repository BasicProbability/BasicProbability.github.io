Subject Re Does Justjustifiable War exist

Some thoughts

A On the nonpacifist side

1 Killing to defend the innocent may be if anything more justifiable
than killing in selfdefense  I can turn my own other cheek but I have
no right to turn someone elses

2 It seems to me that if Jesus had meant to teach pacifism He would have
made His position more explicit  He didnt tell the centurion to leave the
army for instance and the NT is full of military metaphors

B On the pacifist side

1 Apparently many early Christians refused to fight in the Roman army
or stated that one should refuse if given a choice  But its not clear
whether they were objecting to war per se or objecting to Roman policies

2 In modern warfare it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at
combatants  Bombing both conventional and nuclear kills lots of civilians

3 Its hard to tell whether any particular war is justified at the time
Often it takes decades for the requisite information to become available
to the general public
