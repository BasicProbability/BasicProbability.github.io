Subject Re Divine providence vs Murphys Law

In article Apr19051328199329224athosrutgersedu rolfejuniordsuedu Tim Rolfe writes
Romans 828 RSV   We know that in everything God works for good with those 
who love him who are called according to his purpose 

Murphys Law  If anything can go wrong it will

We are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on
Murphys Law  But how do we harmonize that with Romans 828  For that
matter how appropriate is humor contradicted by Scripture
                            

Ive always taken Murphys Law to be an exhortation to prudence and
an observation about the behavior of complex systems rather than a
denial of divine benevolence
