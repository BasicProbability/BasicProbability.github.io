I have seen the claims but I dont know if there are any
authenticated cases of people making prolonged speeches in
real languages they dont know From my observations speaking
in tongues in practice has nothing at all do with this

I have a simple test I take several people who can speak
only one language eg chinese russian german english
Then I let the gifted one start speaking in toungues
The audience should understand the gifted one clearly
in their native language However the gifted one can
only hear himself speaking in his own language

Works everytime 8
Perhaps I would believe the gifted ones more if they were
glorifying God rather than themselves Then perhaps wed
witness a real miracle
