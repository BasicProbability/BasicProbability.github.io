 This subject was beaten to death on bitlistservchristia recently
 until Madge stepped in and closed the topic  It has been discussed
 since privately in email amongst their participants and Ive 
 received some of it  A fairly large file approx 18 KB of comments 
 made on the March On Washington was among these  If it hasnt been 
 posted here already I dont know  I just scan through this 
 newsgroup as at 1200 bps I couldnt possibly read it all I would
 be glad to send it along  I believe that it would be of interest to
 people here
 
 
 I hope that anyone who remembers seeing Rev Troy Perrys
 performance at the 1987 March On Washington will see for themselves
 just how inconceivable it is to mix Christianity with homosexuality

You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
that are spiritfilled believers not MCCrs before you go lumping us all
together with Troy Perry  

The Lord IS working in our community the homosexual community that is  Hes
not asking us to change our sexual nature but He is calling us to practice
the morality that He established from the beginning

Isnt Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue
he can especially homosexuality  Lets reach the homosexuals for Christ 
Lets not try to change them just need to bring them to Christ  If He
doesnt want them to be gay He can change that  If they are living a moral
life committed to someone of the same sex and God is moving in their lives
who are we to tell them they have to change

Thats my two cent

God Bless You All
