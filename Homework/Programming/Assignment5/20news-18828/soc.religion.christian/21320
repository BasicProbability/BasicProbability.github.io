Well its that time of year again here at IU  graduation
Unfortunately this means that I am out of here more than likely for
good  I cannot say if Ill be in here under another username or not or
even if Ill ever get back in here at all  I am leaving this part of my
ministry to another brother John Right  So have fun and remember that
flaming can be considered slander
