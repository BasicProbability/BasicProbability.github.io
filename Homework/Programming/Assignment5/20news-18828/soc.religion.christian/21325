Subject Re Question about Virgin Mary

I think youre talking about the assumption of the Blessed Virgin
Mary  It says that The Immaculate Mother of God the ever Virgin
Mary having completed the course of her earthly life was assumed
body and soul into heavenly glory  This was defined by a Papal
statement in 1950 though it had certainly been believed by some
before that  Like the Immaculate Conception this is primarily a
Roman Catholic doctrine and like it it has no direct Biblical
support  Note that Catholics do not believe in sola scriptura
That is they do not believe that the Bible is the only source of
Christian knowledge  Thus the fact that a doctrine has little
Biblical support is not necessarily significant to them  They believe
that truth can be passed on through traditions of the Church and also
that it can be revealed to the Church  Im not interested in yet
another CatholicProtestant argument but if any Catholics can tell us
the basis for these beliefs I think it would be appropriate  clh

In the Bible there are a lot of instances where God speaks
to people where a person just came to know some piece
of information where a person walks off into the desert
for 40 days etc With all of Gods power He certainly can
do whatever He wants when He wants it The Bible ends
with the book of Revelations But does Gods reign end there  No
So who can say for sure that Gods messages are either no longer
happening or still happening 

I can now hear the clamor for proof 8
With the cold response Ive gotten from the past from this
group its very hard to get the point across Ill only
go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look
at documents stored somewhere Ive cited the uncorrupted
bodies of saints before Theyre still there 8
The apparitions at Fatima Portugal culminated in a miracle
specifically granted to show Gods existence That was
the spinningdescending of the sun It was seen in several
countries That event is approved by the Pope Currently
images of Mary in Japan Korea Yugoslavia Philippines Africa
are showing tears natural or blood These are still under
investigation by the Church But realize that investigations
take decades to finish And if the message is Christ will come
in ten days thats a bit too late isnt it 8
Other events under investigation are inner locutions coming
to know stigmata the person exhibits Christs wounds And
they dont heal And doctors dont know why
Nonbelievers are welcome to pore through documents Im sure

This stuff is not like Koresh Or Oral Roberts give me 5M
or God will call me home Its free Find out why theyre
happening as we ourselves are studying why If anybody
can figure this out tell us  You can be of any religion
If you have the resources go to one of the countries I mentioned
These are not members only events God and Mary invites 
everybody

So in conclusion finally 
We RCs believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary
We are scared to death sometimes although were told not to
There are more proofs and events And that is why not everything
is in the Bible Although in a lot of the apparitions we are told
to read the Bible

As far as the Protestant vs Catholics issue is concerned
In the end Gods churches will unite Im not sure how
I have some idea But the point is we shouldnt worry
about the versus part Just do Gods work Thats all
that matters Unity will come

BTW Im just a plain person Im not the Popes spokesperson
But I am RC
