Subject Legal definition of religion


  
           Its my understanding that the US Supreme Court has never 
       given a legal definition of religion  This despite the many 
       cases involving religion that have come before the Court 
           Can anyone verify or falsify this  
           Has any state or other government tried to give a legal 
       definition of religion
