Subject Re If There Were No Hell

 Heres a question that some friends and I were debating last night
 
 Q If you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
    unbelievers simply remained dead would you remain a Christian
 
 My contention is that if you answer this question with No I would
 not then remain a Christian then you really are not one now  
 Following Jesus Christ has everything to do with sharing in
 his work and spreading the news that the Kingdom of Heaven is already
 among us  Fearbased religion is not a faithrelationship with the
 One Who made us all

So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isnt really
a Christian at all It sounds like it to me

Mit Liebe in Christus
