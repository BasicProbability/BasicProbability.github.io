Subject Re Why do people become atheists

Let me tell you my story
I grew up catholic Up until I was 14 it wasnt an issue for me Then I met
a bornagain christian a very sweet person not proseletyzingsp not 
imposing I tried to get into being as christian as I could as I felt I 
should

But the more I tried the more depressed I got I felt guilty for some of my
own personal honest feelings I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict
until I was 23

Then I taught myself to think rationally I read a lot of books pro and con 
religion in general and specifically catholicism I came to a crisis point
then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist 

This is a very loose explanation but its the gist of it

Now at 26 I feel better about myself better selfesteem a generally 
stronger person I have welldefined goals I have a strong and stable sense 
of morals and values I am not a neonazi or a corrupt politicain etc I 
believe in human rights and live and let live among other things I am very 
antiviolent and antihatred This is to debunk the myth that atheists are
depraved
Religion has no place in my system
Tough

Bertrand Russell said that we cannot know god doesnt exist we cant prove 
it So in that sense we can only truly be agnostic But for all practical
purposes there is no god
