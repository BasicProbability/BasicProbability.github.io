Subject Christians in the Martial Arts

Greetings and Salutations

I would like to get in touch with people who
a consider themselves Christians you define it and
b are in the Martial Arts

Some topics for discussion
	 your particular martial art
	 your view of the relationship between
		Christianity and your art
	 your view of the relationship between
		your Christianity and your art
	 why should a Christian participate in MA
	 why shouldnt a Christian participate in MA
	 Biblical views of MA pro or con

For example I heard from one fellow
	I tried the Karate for Christ thing and it wasnt for me
	 why or why not

As an aside I am involved in NO official way with an
organization called the Christian Black Belt Association and
I would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events
to those who are interested  No you wont be put on any
mailing list nor will your name be sold

However if you ARE intested in an email list let me know

I am interested in email replies ONLY as this is crossposted 
to groups I dont normally read  If anyone wants a summary
or of course ongoing discussion then let me know


Shalom
