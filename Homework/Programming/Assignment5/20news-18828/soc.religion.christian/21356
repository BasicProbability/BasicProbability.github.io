Subject Re Atheists and Hell

 Imagine the worst depth of despair youve
 ever encountered or the worst physical pain youve ever experienced
 Some people suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish
 in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful But at least
 the pain does end in death What if you lived a hundred such lives
 at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another
 What if you lived a million a billion years in this state
 What if this kept going forever


Did this happen to Jesus I dont think so not from what I heard He lived
ONE DAY of suffering and died If the wages of sin is the above paragraph then
JESUS DIDNT PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE

Id be surprised to see the moderator let this one through but I seriously
want a reasonable explanation for this
