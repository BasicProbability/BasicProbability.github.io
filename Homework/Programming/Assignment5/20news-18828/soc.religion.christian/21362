Subject Re When are two people married in Gods e

In article 28727athosrutgersedu 62johnsoncuaedu Yusef AlTariq writes
Whos law is it that a wedding has to happen in a church  the only reqirement
is that you and the bride agreee to marry each other  How also can you say 
christian wedding when the proces of marriage is nt really discussed in the
bible  why mus t a person get a civil marriage also  The only standards i
look to are those imposed upon me by god not of society

If you want to live with someone you can
If you dont want to have a civil marriage dont
If you dont want to have a wedding in a church dont
If you want to call that a marriage go right ahead

I hope that the young people that are around you dont follow your example

If the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the
Bible I have to disagree  Various aspects of marriage are discussed
in some of Pauls letters Ephesians 5 sees marriage as a symbol of
Gods relationship with the church  If it means specifically that the
marriage ceremony isnt described then that seems to be true  But I
think what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much that
it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various
commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the
Bible  clh
