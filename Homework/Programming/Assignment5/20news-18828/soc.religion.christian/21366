From mdw33310uxacsouiucedu Michael D Walker
Subject Re Question about Virgin Mary


	Two follow ups to Marks last posting

	1  As far as current investigations the Church recently declared the
	    crying statue and corresponding messages from Mary at Akita
	    Japan as approved I found this out about a month ago

	2  Again in the proof department start with the appearances of Mary
	    at Fatima  Among other things there were pictures taken of the
	    miracle of the sun that appeared in some major American newspaper
	    The New York Times I believe as well as most of the major
	    European newspapers  

	    I could talk or post for hours on this topic but 
		I have a thesis to write
						God Bless
