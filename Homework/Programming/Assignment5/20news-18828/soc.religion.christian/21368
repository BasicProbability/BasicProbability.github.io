Subject Re The arrogance of Christians

newscbnewskattcom writes
Arrogance is arrogance  It is not the result of religion it is the result
of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and ones desire to show
others of ones rightness  I assume that God decided to be judge for our
sake as much as his own if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the 
judge well probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged 
ourselves                                            
 
1 Cor 113132 But if we judged ourselves we would not come under judgment 
When we are judged by the   Lord we are being discipled so
that we will not be condemned with the world

1 Cor 53 Even though I am not physically present I am with you in spirit
And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this just as if I were
present           

1 Cor 21516 The spiritual man makes judgments about all things but he
himself is not      subject to any mans       judgement  For
who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him  But we have the
mind of Christ

Jude 1415 Enoch the seventh from Adam prophesied about these men  See
the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge
everyone and to    convict all the ungodly of       all
the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way and of all the harsh words
ungodly sinners have spoken against him

Arrogance is a sin  Although a desire to show others of ones rightness may
be a sign of arrogance in some cases  it may be only a sign that they are
following the Bible in others

Jude 2223 Be merciful to those who doubt snatch others from the fire and
save them to others show mercy mixed with   fear  hating   even
 the clothing stained by corrupted flesh


If I find someone arrogant I typically dont have anything to do with them  

I hope you dont find me arrogant then  This sounds like a bad practice 
ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant

James 119 My dear brothers take note of this  Everyone should be quick to
listen slow to speak and slow to become angry

 Aaron
