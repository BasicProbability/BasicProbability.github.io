I have seen the claims but I dont know if there are any
authenticated cases of people making prolonged speeches in
real languages they dont know From my observations speaking
in tongues in practice has nothing at all do with this

I have a simple test I take several people who can speak
only one language eg chinese russian german english
Then I let the gifted one start speaking in toungues
The audience should understand the gifted one clearly
in their native language However the gifted one can
only hear himself speaking in his own language


There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which
are problematic  Its use as prayer language seems especially troubling
to me  I understand that when you pray in tongues the spirit is doing
the talking  And when you pray you pray to God  And the Spirit is
God  So the Spirit is talking to Himself  Which is why I only go
by the Pentecost use where its an actual language

Moreover the phrase though I speak with the tongues of men and angels
used by Paul in I Cor is misleading out of context   Some would then
assume that there is some angelic tongue and if when they speak it
is no KNOWN language then it is an angelic tongue

Hmmmin the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels  After all THEY were not punished in any manner

So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE
ANOTHER  Its disturbing to think that some people find ways to 
justify jabbering

But Ill buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned

Trouble is while such stories abound any and all attempts at
verification and we are to test the spirit either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances or that outright
fabrication was involved  The Brother Puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing  And linguistically a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language inflection or no

Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay
