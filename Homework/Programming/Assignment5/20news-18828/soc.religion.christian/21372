Subject Re Variants in the NT Text cont


	I wish to echo what D Andrew Kille wrote  I know of no published form
in English of the Dtype recension of Acts  Of course Bezae is quite bizarre
in the gospels as well  Only Dtype texts share Bezaes strange readings
	By the way D stands for Codex Claromontanus elsewhere
