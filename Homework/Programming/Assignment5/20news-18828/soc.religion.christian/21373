 Hello all
      I have a question about Satan  I was taught a long time ago
 that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
 because he challenged Gods authority  The problem is I cannot
 find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it
 originate
 
Satan was one of Gods highest ranking angels like Uriel Raphael
Michael and Gabriel  In fact his name was Satanel  He did challenge
Gods authority and got kicked out of heaven  A lot of the mythology
of Satan he lost the el suffix when he fell comes from the
Book of Enoch and is not found in the bible

Read the Book of Enoch available thru bookstores or get the book
called Angels an endangered species I think
