Hello all
     I have a question about Satan  I was taught a long time ago
that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
because he challenged Gods authority  The problem is I cannot
find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it
originate

i did a workshop on this for an episcopalian student gathering a
couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too  as far as
i could tell although that story was never specifically told in the
bible many references are made to it primarily in the new testament
in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of
satan as a excuse the pun devils advocate for yahweh  see the
book of job  getting back to the fallen angel story there are no
references to lucifer in the bible except for a mistranslation of
the morning star in the king james version isaiah 1412 which
probably referred to a babylonian monarch much in the same was as the
sun king referred to louis xiv  

all in all i dont know where the story came from it may have been
rolling around for a long time or milton paradise lost may have
invented it  sorry for the sketchiness of the rest of this but i am
in a hurry and need to eat lunch  feel free to email me about the
other stuff i found out  although a lot of it is just the result
of a bible concordance program called quickverse  its really
lousy by the way  dont buy it 

Wondering
