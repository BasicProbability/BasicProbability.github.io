Subject Satan and MTV

Somewhere someone told me that Satan was the angel in charge of
music in heaven and on top of that he was the most beautiful
of the angels  Isnt it funny that these days how MTV has become
the bible of music and beauty these days  MTV controls what bands
are popular no matter how bad they are  In fact it is better to
be politically correct  like U2 Madonna  than to have any
musical talent  Then of course you have this television station
that tells us all how to dress  Think about it who started the
retrofashion craze  MTV and Madonna  Gag

Anyway just food for thought  It is really my own wierd theory

If Revelation was to come true today I think MTV would the ever
changing waters music and fashion world that the beast would
arise from and Madonna will be the whore of Babylon riding the
beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs

Hmmmmgreat idea for a bookmovie
