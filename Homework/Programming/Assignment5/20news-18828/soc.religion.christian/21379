There is dis
crepancy even among charismatic organizations as to the proper use
of tongues  Be it revelatory with interpretation for prayer use
or for signifying believers which I doubt since any one can do it
Pentecostals Assembly of God Church of Christ seem to espouse all
three  Neopentecostals tend to view prayer use and as a sign as the
uses  Speaking in tongues during a service is not usually done by
neopentecostals because for the most part they still attend Protestant
churches  Nondenominational churches seem to view the use as a sign
as merely optional but recommended

Koberg

	Just a couple of minor corrections here

	1  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in
tongues in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to
Pentecostal teaching  You are probably thinking of Church of God in
Christ the largest AfricanAmerican Pentecostal denomination

	2  Im not sure what you mean by signifying believers  but it
should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now nor has it
ever held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian 
The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals including the AG maintain is
that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming
a Christian in which one is Baptized in the Holy Spirit  That may be
what you were referring to but I point this out because Pentecostals are
frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order
to be a Christian  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the
majority of Pentecostals   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in
Mark 16 about these signs following them that believe but they generally
do not interpret this as meaning if you dont pactice the signs you arent
saved

	3  I know its hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that
has such diversity but I think youve made some pretty big
generalizations here  Do NeoPentecostals only believe in tongues as a
sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message 
Ive never heard of that before  In fact I would have characterized them
as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as
a sign of Spirit Baptism  Also while neoPentecostals may not be
inclined to speak in tongues in the nonPentecostal churches they attend
they do have their own meetings and in many cases a whole church will be
charismatic
