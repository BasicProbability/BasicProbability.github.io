I was surprised when I heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad 
student I know especially since he had seminary training  I have read the 
same essay and do not find Lewis making any such claim  Rather Lewis is 
condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make 
political jabs at opponents feigned as confessions of guilt ie Lord please 
forgive us for allowing insert political issueideaplatform to exist in our
country it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness  I would be interested in
knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance please
