I posted this a couple of weeks ago and it doesnt seem to have appeared  
on the newsgroup and I havent had a reply from the moderator We were  
having intermittent problems with our mail at the time Please excuse me  
if you have seen this before

Should Christians fight

Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there  
are such things as justifiable wars I have started looking into these  
things and have jotted down my findings as I go I havent answered all  
his questions yet and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  
tack but possibly Ill be able to get into it more deeply later and post  
some more info soon

Our duty to our neighbour

Do good to all men Gal 610
Love our neighbour as ourselves Matt 2239

Act the part of the good Samaritan Luke 10 toward any who may be in  
trouble We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  
man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  
people harm even medical corps of the army etc

Christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of Israel  
Ephesians 21112 and also recognise that God rules in the kingdoms of  
men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  
of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith

We are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just  
passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  
this can also be applied to politics etc but thats another story We  
are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to  
be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  
preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  
Gods kingdom

Our duty to the state

Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesars and unto God  
the things which be Gods Luke 2025
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers For there is no power  
but of God the powers that be are ordained of God Whosoever resisteth  
the power resisteth the ordinance of God Rom 1312
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake whether  
it be to king as supreme for so is the will of God that with well doing  
ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men 1 Pet 21315

These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  
divine command but it is equally clear from Acts 51929 that when any  
ordinance of man runs counter to Gods law we must refuse submission to  
it The reason for this is that we are Gods bond servants and His  
service is our lifes task An example of the type of thing is in Col  
32223 where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the Lord  so  
also we should work as if our boss was God  ie Pressed down shaken  
together and running over oops  a bit of a side track there

In the contests between the nations we are on Gods side  a side that is  
not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truth

When we believe in God and embrace His promises we become fellow  
citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God and are no longer  
interested in associations of the world Think of this in relation to  
unions etc as well Paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may  
run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard  
any association which would retard our progress  Thou therefore endure  
hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ No man that warreth entangleth  
himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath  
chosen him to be a soldier 2 Tim 234

One of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked  
together with unbelievers One of the obvious applications of this is  
marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business  
partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  
with any person or persons not believing the truth about God in this case  
the army The principle comes from Deut 2210  remember that as well as  
them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one  
unclean under the law These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 61318  
 I suggest you read this The yoking also has another aspect  that of  
servitude and Jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked  
with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers We have already seen  
that we are bondservants of Christ and Paul says become not ye the  
bondservants of men 1 Cor 723 RV

An example from the Old Testament the question is asked in 2 Chr 192  
Shouldest thou help the ungodly The situation here is a good  
example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers  
Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life Here are the facts
1 He had made an affinity with Ahab who had sold himself to work  
wickedness before the Lord 1 Kings 2125
2 When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance he had agreed and said  
I am as thou art my people as thy people 1 Kings 224  an unequal  
yoking
3 He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  
on hearing the prophet of the Lord trying to do the right thing he  
found that he was yoked and therefore couldnt break away from the evil  
association he had made

God says to us Come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not  
the unclean thing and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  
daughters 2 Cor 617

This is more or less what I have found out so far  Im still looking into  
it as I dont think Ive answered all the questions raised by Alastair  
yet Heres a summary and a few things to think about

The Christian in under command Obedience to this command is an essential  
factor in his relationship with Christ John 151014

Total dedication to this course of action is required Romans 1212

Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  
followers 1 Pet 278

We are to be separated to God Rom 64 This involves a masterservant  
relationship Rom 61216

No man can serve two masters Matt 6241314

All that is in the Kosmos is lust and pride  quite opposed to Gos 1  
John 216 Christs kingdom is not of this world ie not worldly in  
nature  if it was his servants would fight to deliver him If Christ is  
our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  
was not of this world then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  
master

Strangers and pilgrims have no rights and we cannot swear allegiance to  
anyone but God

The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all 2 Tim 224   
this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout  
our lives There is a war to be waged not with mans weapons 2 Cor  
1034 but with Gods armour Eph61320

Ill probably post some more when Ive had time to look into things a bit  
further
