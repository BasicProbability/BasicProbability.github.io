Subject Mormon beliefs about bastards


    Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views 
children born out of wedlock  In particular Im interested to know if any 
stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents  Im especially 
keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on 
bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical 
book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City  If this is an issue on which the 
official position has changed over time Im interested in learning both old 
and new beliefs  Email or posting is fine  All information or pointers are 
appreciated
