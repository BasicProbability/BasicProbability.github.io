Subject Re National repentance

mcovingtaisun3aiugaedu Michael Covington writes

I heard on the radio today about a Christian student conference where
Christians were called to repent of Americas national sins such
as sexual promiscuity

How can I repent of someone elses sin   I cant

And when I claim to repent of someone elses sin am I not in fact
judging him  Jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us
not to judge people Judge not that ye be not judged

Strictly speaking youre right  we cant repent for somebody else
for what theyve done  I guess I dont think its out of line to talk
about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation
in The sins of society  or for our tacit approval by our silence of
sinful attitudes or practicesit may be that were also just plain
begging for mercy hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on
our whole country for the sake of a few much as Abraham sought to do
for the sake of Lot  Hmmm the results there were pretty cautionary

A few times lately when Ive observed some either outandout sinful 
activity or just some selfdestructive activity Ive gotten a strong
impression that many folks really dont know any better  Christs pity
on the crowds as being like sheep without a shepherd rings true to me
If these folks dont have a clue do I bear any responsibility for my
not having communicated a better way  Worse still have I expressed 
judgement and disgust at their doings and thus alienated them from any 
positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive  
I know Ive got something to repent about on that score

Anyway its a real interesting question
