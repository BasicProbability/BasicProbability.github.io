Any one who thinks that Homosexuality and Christianity are compatible should check  
out
	Romans 127
	I Corinthians 69
	I Timothy 110
	Jude 17
	II Peter 269
	Gen 19
	Lev  1822
to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality

Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spiritled course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know  I suggest that
you stop prooftexting about things you know nothing about
