The Apostle Paul Romans 911 points out that God chose Jacob
rather than Esau If we admit the possibility that they had lived previous
lives and that in accordance with the Asiatic idea of karma

And following Romans to 913 As it is written Jacob have I loved
but Esau have I hated  How could God have loved and hated in the
past tense those that are not yet born neither having done good
or evil

WoahThe context is about Gods calling out a special people the Jews to
carry the promise  To read the meaning as literal people is to miss Pauls
entire point  Id be glad to send anyone more detailed explanations of this
passage if interested
