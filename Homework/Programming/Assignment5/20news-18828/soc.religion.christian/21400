Subject Re Deuterocanonicals esp Sirach

wagnergracemathuhedu David Wagner writes

The deuterocanonical books were added much later in the churchs
history  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture  I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing  And that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends

	Whoah  whoah  whoah  WHOAH   What

	That last paragraph just about killed me  The Deuterocanonicals have
	ALWAYS been accepted as inspired scripture by the Catholic Church
	which has existed much longer than any Protestant Church out there
	It was Martin Luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to
	REMOVE certain booksnot the fact that the Catholic Church decided
	to add some much laterthat is the reason for the difference between
	Catholic and Protestant bibles  

	Sorry for the tonebut that comment really irked me
