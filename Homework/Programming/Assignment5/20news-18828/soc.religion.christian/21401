Should Christians fight

Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there  
are such things as justifiable wars I have started looking into these  
things and have jotted down my findings as I go I havent answered all  
his questions yet and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  
tack but possibly Ill be able to get into it more deeply later and post  
some more info soon

May I suggest the book Ethics by Dr Norm Geisler of Dallas Theological
Seminary  In it he goes over all the arguments pro and con and inbetween
and comes up with a very reasonable answer  If I have time and there is
enough interest I may post his position
