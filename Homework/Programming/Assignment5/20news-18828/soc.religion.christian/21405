Which Version of the Bible do you consider to be the most
accurate translation

Well knowing Greek and Hebrew Im probably not as picky about translations
as I would be if English translations were my only source of information
BUT

1 Any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans
lations is almost certainly unclear in the original 

2 It is very bad practice to shop for a translation that fits your own
doctrinal positions

Personally I still like the RSV  NRSV and NASV are also very good

I have a strong preference for editions that do not indent the beginning
of each verse as if verses were paragraphs  The verse numbering is a
relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence
