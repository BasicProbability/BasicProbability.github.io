Subject Re How I got saved

Well I was certainly turned off by that first paragraph of oftused
platitudes I cant count the times Ive heard those common tactics
anymoreyou may not believe it but that doesnt change the fact
that its truethe old analogy about trusting your parentssheesh
Need I point out how parents can show children that they are right
That difference in capability alone crushes that analogy as any facts
about Christianity I have seen turned out to be beliefs What I seek is
factknowledgeif I can get it and evidence for a belief if I cant
So far from Christians I have received neither

Before becoming a Christian I too had problems when I asked one to explain
it to meThe actual evidence is not always what you see on a persons 
outside It should be but is not always
	A very specific somewhat miraculous example of the truth of God
working to help His followers is soemthing that happened to me For nearly
4 years after an accident I had severe complications from a triple 
fracture in my left leg and surgerypins put in then removed The bone 
itself was perfectly healed No infectoin that could be detected Yet I 
was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and
bluish More complicatios developed in my other leg none of which could
be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te
northern Illinois region We went everywhereno one could explain it
Durin gthat summer June 19 1991 to be exact I gave my life and heart
to Christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life which i never
really had anyway because of what he did for me on the cross and the 
fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it I was facing
the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair I was confined to one in 
order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems
were unknown had been in it for about 2 12 months before that day
	I found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after
I put my faith where my mouth was one more in the long line of doctors
and not even an orthopeodic specialist diagnosed my problems with no
difficulty set me on the path to an effective cure and I was walking
and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for
4 years The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have
overlooked because it was perfectly obvious from my test results
	Maybe this doesnt hit you as miraculous But to me it really
is Imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to
walk mcuh longerand is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run
knowing that the problem was there all along and was revealed just
after she did what she knew was right As the song says
	Our God is an awesome God
