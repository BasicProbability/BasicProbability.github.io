Subject Re Revelations  BABYLON

Woo So far weve had the following interpretations of the figure of
the Whore of Babylon in Rev 17  18

a The United States of America
b MHO dB which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who
   corrupt and oppress human society
c Historical Jerusalem
d Historical Rome

Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning How
about  The prophecy reveals Gods judgement on the corrupt  idolatrous
state oppressing his chosen people d  That Gods judgement extends
especially to his once chosen city c because despite that Citys
special call it still rejected Gods grace at the decisive time Rev
118  also isnt Rev1924 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem 
That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of RomeBabylon a and
is equally subject to Gods judgement  That the Good BookTM actually
encompasses all these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual
powers warring against mankind through the very society that weve
created b

Clever huh  Flame here No need to argue at all 

I think Marys view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a
deliberate contrast between Rev 1718 and Rev 2122  the mortal
Jerusalem chosen by God but never historically fulfilling its vocation
and the new Jerusalem perfected outside of history purely by Gods
grace eg Details like Rev 171  who sits on many waters cf Rev 22
the single stream in the new Jersualem the river of life flowing from
the throne of God and of the Lamb

Rex  didnt understand your post  whats the relevance of Babylonian
mystery religions to all this Please elaborate your ideas about OT 
the Book of Rev Why do you freak at the idea of a primarily spiritual
interpretation of Rev Id mail but I cant get thru
