     Could anyone enlighten me on how the Mormon church views 
 children born out of wedlock  In particular Im interested to know if any 
 stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents  Im especially 
 keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on 
 bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big  
genealogical 
 book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City  If this is an issue on which the 
 official position has changed over time Im interested in learning both  
old 
 and new beliefs  Email or posting is fine  All information or pointers are 
 appreciated
 

Well since my wife is in your gentle term a bastard I can
probably speak with a bit of authority on this Any stigma
associated with children conceived andor born out of wedlock rests
solely upon the parentstheyve committed a sexual transgression for
which they should repent The child itself has no a priori limitations
on him or her indeed the concept of blaming the child for the
parents sins is one most Mormons would find appalling note that LDS
theology rejects original sin as the term is usually defined and the
subsequent need for infant baptism cf Moroni 8 in the Book of
Mormon  Indeed LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their childrens sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly cf DC 682528 note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church

Also note that there is no big genealogical book in Salt Lake City
The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
containing on microfilm vital statistic records birth christening
baptism marriage death gathered from all over the entire world I
may be misremembering but I believe they have records for some 2
billion people in that vault At the same time the LDS Church is
building up an online genealogical database In neither case is there
some kind of worthiness screening as to whether someone can be
entered in The only potential issue is that of establishing who the
parents were and that would apply only in the case of the database

The following arrived as a separate posting clh

A followup to my own followuplest anyone misunderstand the term
bastard is one which I have never in 25 years of LDS Church
membership heard applied formally or informally to a child born out
of wedlock and indeed would rightly be considered a vulgar
offensive term I would not have echoed the expression in my reply
except in hopes that the poster would recognize the offensive nature
of the word in the given context Unfortunately after posting my
reply I remembered that subtle points are often lost on the net and
figured Id better spell it out  bruce
