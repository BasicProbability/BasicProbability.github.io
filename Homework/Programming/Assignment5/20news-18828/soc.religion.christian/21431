You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
that are spiritfilled believers not MCCrs before you go lumping us all
together with Troy Perry  


Gee I think there are some real criminals robbers muderers drug
addicts who appear to be fun loving caring people too  So whats
your point  Is it OK just because the people are nice

Isnt Satan having a hayday pitting Christian against Christian over any issue
he can especially homosexuality  Lets reach the homosexuals for Christ 
Lets not try to change them just need to bring them to Christ  If He
doesnt want them to be gay He can change that  If they are living a moral
life committed to someone of the same sex and God is moving in their lives
who are we to tell them they have to change


I think the old saying  hate the sin and not the sinner is
appropriate here  Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably
dont hate the people  I dont  I dont hate my kids when they do
wrong either  But I tell them what is right and if they lie or dont
admit they are wrong or just dont make an effort to improve or
repent they get punished  I think this is quite appropriate  You
may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here
Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through
feel goodism  Maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more
than God  Kind of like the Adam and Eve story  Read it and compare
it to todays mentality  You may be suprised
