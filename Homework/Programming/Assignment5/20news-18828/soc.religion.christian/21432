Subject Re Why do people become atheists

Ken
Then what happens when you die
Why are you here
What is the purpose of Your life do you think its 
just by chance youre in the family you are in and have the
friends you have
Why do you think your searching  To fill the void that
exists in your life  Who do you think can fill that void
