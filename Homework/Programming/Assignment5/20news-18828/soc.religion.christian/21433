 Bob reminds me of my roommate  In order to disbelieve atheism he says 
 he will need to be proven wrong about it  Well I dont even waste 
 my time trying  I tell him that hell just have to take my word for it 
 In response he tells me he will say an atheists prayer for me 



Who is the atheists prayer being said to
