     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense

     First there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century and
theres nothing definitive before the 17th

     Second worship of Osiris is not nor has it ever been a part of
Masonic practice we are strictly nondenominational

tangents never ending tangents

     You said it
