Subject Re Why do people become atheists

 I am interested in finding out why people become
 atheists after having believed in some godGod
 In conversing with them on other groups Ive
 often sensed anger or hostility   Though I dont
 mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile
 it does seem to be one motivation for giving up
 faith  Thus some atheism might result from 
 brokenness


im atheist
just because
there is no supreme being
there is the world as we know it
and its wonderful and incredible
and there is love between people
and these things are everything
i dont believe in a god that made this all
i believe in the amazing and beautiful
teaming with life world i live in
