Subject Re Marys assumption

I hate to sound flippant having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before but Im afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that the assumption of Mary would be better phrased our
assumptions about Mary  In all the time Ive been reading about
Mary on this group I can not recall reading much about Mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant if any Scriptural
foundation  

I find in the New Testament a very real portrait of Christs parents
as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to Gods working beyond doubt  But the almalga
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures untouched by sin or human
desire  Only Christ himself was so truly sanctified and even He knew
temptation albeit without submitting to it

I also dont see the necessity of saying the Holy Parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of Gods grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being  

I wont start yelling about how people are worshipping Mary etc
since folks have told me otherwise about that but I do think we
lose part of the wonder of Gods Incarnation in Christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless sexless deathless otherworldly beings
