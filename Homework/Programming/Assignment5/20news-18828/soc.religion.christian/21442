does he believe in predestination
Of course I believe in Predestination  Its a very biblical doctrine as
Romans 82830 shows among other passages  Furthermore the Church
has always taught predestination from the very beginning 

really  you may be right but id like proof  as far as i know and
i am not a div school student the catholic church does not seem to
accept predestination  my chaplain told me beware of greeks bearing
gifts with reference to this doctrine it seems to have the curious
result that human beings are not held responsible for their own
actions  ill answer how you deal with this in a minute

But to say
that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free
will  Men freely choose the course of their life which is also
affected by the grace of God  However unlike the Calvinists and
Jansenists I hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God 1 Timothy 24 

right  that doesnt really seem like predestination to me but ill
continue with what youre saying

For God must give enough grace to all to be saved  But only the elect
who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance which guarantees heaven  This does not mean that those
without that grace cant be saved it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need
it as they had freely chosen hell

this is really confusing to me especially since i still believe that
christ jesus died for ALL of us  preknowledge of obstinacy seems
like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses  but
then i am not really biblically supported in this opinion  or am i
others

People who are saved are saved by the grace of God and not by their own
effort for it was God who disposed them to Himself and predestined
them to become saints  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish  Thus they were
deserving of Gods punishment as they had rejected their Creator and
sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit

so God uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where its needed
and not where it isnt  and so there are the saved and the notsaved
and nothing in between  hmmmm

yes it is up to God to judge  but he will only mete out that
punishment at the last judgement 

Well I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little
for those He cant bless in the next life He blesses in this one  

although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause
social problems it ends up doing just that  if there is supposed to
be some sort of sign that someone is elect like lots of children or
success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go
around thinking that those who dont are doomed to hell

in a way though this sounds like the opposite idea  those doomed
to hell will have a great life on earth  thats almost like the
converse of what i believe  responsibility for what we do now will
be punished after we die  youre saying what we get after we die has
a direct bearing on how we live now  strange
 
And
those He will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one
or in Purgatory for their sins  Every sin incurs some temporal
punishment thus God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
cf 2 Samuel 121314 Davids sin of Adultery and Murder were
forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child  And I
need not point out the idea of punishment because of Gods judgement is
quite prevelant in the Bible  Sodom and Gommorrah Moses barred from
the Holy Land the slaughter of the Cannanites Annias and Saphira
Jerusalem in 70 AD etc

so sin is either punished now or later  and not both  what if its
 sort of halfpunished  are there any grey areas in this doctrine

 my stuff deleted
 We should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf Proverbs 241112 but
 does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the
 US or even the UN involved  I do not think so but I am an
 isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general  But in
 the case of Bosnia I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
 involved it would not be a just war  Blessed after all are the
 peacemakers was what Our Lord said not the interventionists  Our
 actions in Bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is
 unrelated to anything to justify it for us

 the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to
 establish peace and stop the atrocities  im not suggesting wwIII  i
 dont really understand what you mean by a just war  of course i am
 not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jumping in at
 the first opportunity can you say kuwait  we happen to be a big
 country with a lot of resources as well as a lot of debt and this
 gives us some responsibility in the world whether we like it or not
 flashbacks of wwII as well as vietnam should be haunting us

 yet another difference of opinion  so be it
