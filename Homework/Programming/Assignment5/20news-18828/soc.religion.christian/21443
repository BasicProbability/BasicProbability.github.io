Subject Re Question about Virgin Mary

And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria
also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation even though they
broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the
Council of Chalcedon  It might be argued by some Protestants that the
Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up but the Monophysites put a
big hole in that notion as they also hold the belief and they split
from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing as
far as is known much has been lost from the time of the Fathers

The belief that the churches of Egypt and Syria were or are monophysite is 
false as is the belief that they often held that the Council of Chalcedon 
was Nestorian

These misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors and thus led 
to schism  a schism that is on its way to being healed
