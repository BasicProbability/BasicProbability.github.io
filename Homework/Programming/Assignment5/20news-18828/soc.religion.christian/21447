Subject Re MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY

In article May5025259199328865athosrutgersedu you write
 
 Yes  My comments were long enough that I dont want to repeat
 them here but Ill send them via email back to the author
 Certainly it was not intended to be a description of three similar
 deities though I certainly see why it would look that way
 
Thanks for the letter your comments helped some

As to the last comment I certainly realize that it was not intended to
sound that way  I am still trying to understand how a spiritual being
colud truly be one and three at the same time  All of the descriptions
of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading sort of
they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways but really they are
one trust me

Neither of these is acceptible to me

The fact is so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any
sense to me are the modalistic ones such as Modalistic Monarchianism
or Economic Trinitarianism  I can accept that the three aspects are
intrinsic to the nature of God so I perhaps lean more towards the latter

I am trying here to see if anybody can come up with another description
that is both orthodox and believable

I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox to
the extent that wellmeaning people think theyve just flatout
confused  Theres no problem with things being both 3 and 1 eg  if
the 3 are different parts of the 1  Father Son and Holy Spirit
arent exactly parts of God because parts are things distinguished by
physical separation  All three Persons are omnipresent so they are
obviously arent physically separate  But theyre in some way
different aspects modes or whatever of one God  If you accept
economic trinitarianism its possible that you dont have any
substantive difference with the standard view  Is it possible that
you just dont find the neoPlatonic explanation illuminating
