Subject Re The Nicene Creed was Re MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY

In article May9053919199327401athosrutgersedu db7nandrewcmuedu D Andrew Byler writes

The socalled Creed of Athanasius however has always been a Western
creed and has always had the filioque  The Orthodox have said that
they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but
it is not in use

	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene
Creed it wasnt there to begin with but they certainly did from the
Athanasian Creed which did have it from the beginning

The socalled Athanasian Creed has never been a recognized standard of faith 
in the Orthodox Church It was introduced without the Filioque in certain 
servicebooks in the 17th and 18th centuries at a time when there was a 
strong Western influence on Orhtodoxy
