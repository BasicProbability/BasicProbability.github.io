Subject Re Serbian genocide Work of God

 You might want to rethink your attitude about the Holocaust after
 reading Deuteronomy chapter 28

On the contrary after the Holocaust I would be very cautious about my
interpretatoin of Deuteronomy 28  Not everything that happens is in
accordance with Gods will  You might guess which side of the
predestination issue I am on  I will never assume that evil is 
punishment by God especially when I am speaking of the evil that falls on
someone else  For my own life I will work to discern the hand of God
in the evil that befalls me

See the discussion earlier on Luke 13
