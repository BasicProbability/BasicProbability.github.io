Subject Dreams and out of body incidents

hey folks

Im fairly new to these groups tho some have heard from me before

Id like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents
In normal dreams you cant control anything so obviously
you arent morally responsible for your actions  But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE it seems like a morality applies

Now there seem to be 3 alternatives

1 Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena  In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called mental hygiene that is not trying
to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts

2 Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ie are another plane
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person  A
mark of objective fact is that 1 people report the same objective experience
In this case the same interpersonal moralityethics applies in dreams and
OOBEs as does in waking life

3 Like 2 but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a
real existence a different moralethics apply there and no or maybe 
different moral laws apply there

So There it is  Is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know
of another alternative  respond by post or email

thanks very much
