In all candor I would be happy to be proven wrong about believing  
in atheism  Problem is I will have to be proven wrong

In mentioning some nonsense about psychology  and atheism Bob Muir asks
the following question   

No smiley on the part about atheism I see Do you realize that your
statement says that I was mentioning nonsense about atheism This is
hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making as you
have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the
first Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it
out of hand 
But because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English I may be
misinterpreting your wording here Please clarify did you or did you not
mean to call my statements about atheism nonsense If so care to back
up that claim

	Do I sound broken to you

I answer in the affirmative

OK then Start up the amatuer psycology again How am I broken

Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group
permitted the luxury of arrogance   

YAWN Excuse me I dont recall any portion of my post in which I called
Christians arrogant quote me if I did I do remember calling Christianity
silly and then following that up with information that I was nine years
old when I thought that I also said that I find faith to be intellectually
dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your gods
existence I define faith as belief in the absense of any proof BTW

Also I subscribe to aa as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types
there so in answer to your question no

Finally Id hardly call Christianity beseiged in this country I seldom
see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing
crosses or having Christian bumper stickers I dont know for sure of
course I only say I havent seen it happening What I have seen happening
is my homosexual andor friends being beat up or preached at by people
who claim to be Christs followers I know that this sort of thing isnt
practiced by the majority of Christians but it is a very vocal minority
who are doing it and I dont see comperable victimization of Christians 

Now I have a question for Bob  Why in the world would any selfrespecting
atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group  

The implication being that I am not selfrespecting of course Im not a
student of psychology BTW but I am a student of Creative Writing and
Linguistics so literary analysis is my forte Also if the implications
I see are improper please let me know
Im here because Im not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as
you seem to think atheists should be Did it occur to you that I dont
think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that
will change my life Have you read my other posts here or did you see
atheist and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesnt deserve
your respect
Aw geez Im sorry I probably am getting my back up a little too high
here Its just that the nonsense thing really annoys me I figure you
should see my first reactions though since they are my true reactions to
your question
Now the smoothed feather version
I seek all sorts of knowledge Thats why I came to my university Yes I
am looking at your religion well sorta I have no idea what kind of
Christian you are from the outside and hopefully with an objective view
Ive been trying to ask reasoned questions here because I genuinely dont
know the answers to them but when I saw the question directed at atheists
I figured I would answer After all you can speculate about atheist
motives here all you want hence the amatuer psychology crack but
without an atheist you cant be sure of even one atheists motive       
Im hoping people really
want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several
religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I
actually think about these things Instead Im still faced with the
implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only broken
people are atheist
	Try it from the flip side I posit that atheism is the natural
state and only broken people are theists I offer as proof that so many
people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they 
discovered their religion that religion is regional if people didnt
follow the religion of their areas there would be a more homogenous
mix so many terrorists claim theistic motives and that theists tend
to be so pushy and angry when challenged on altatheism Why are religions
so successful Because there is so much suffering in the world which 
breaks people
Its an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which is another
reason Im here to try to see the flip side of my thinking and also as 
a watchdog for logical fallacies 
I have a 
difficult enough time keeping up with it and I think I know something
                                           
about the subject     
 
The implication here being that atheists cant possibly know anything
about Christianity Probably jumping at shadows again but I think my
reaction is somewhat justified After all the first post suggested that
atheists are broken hostile people This post confirms that someone
else believes it 


Bob reminds me of my roommate  In order to disbelieve atheism he says 
                                             
he will need to be proven wrong about it 

Well he got me there I am a strong atheist because I feel that lack of
evidence especially about something like an omnipotent being implies
lack of existence However I havent met the strong atheist yet who said
that nothing could ever persuade him Call me a seeker if you like I
dont 
Weak atheism is being ignore here though Some atheists simply say I
dont believe in any god rather than my position I believe that no
gods exist For the weak atheist the is no atheism to disbelieve
because they dont actively believe in atheism If you think this is
confusing try figuring out the difference between Protestants and
Methodists from an atheist point of view 
This is another fallacy many theists seem to have that everyone believes in
something followed up by everyone has faith in something Guess what
My atheism ends the moment Im shown a proof of some gods existence Is
that really too much to ask


Well I dont even waste my time trying 

Well I guess you wont succeed in converting him or me Why the
supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on Is
it because you yourself are unconvinced  

 I tell him that hell just have to take my word for it
And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest Note that
I can only speak for myself If you find faith to be honest show me how
I have been unable to reconcile it so far Maybe thats how Im broken
I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that
you should just take my word for it If you accept that you are of a
fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you
think All I ask for is proof of the assertion God exists Logical or
physical proofs only please Then well discuss the nature of God

In response he tells me he will say an atheists prayer for me 
Prayer Uh oh well have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie 

Good luck Bob  And best regards

Good luck to you as well And again I apologize if the inferences I
made were inaccurate
