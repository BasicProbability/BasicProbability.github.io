        Besides I would
       rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in Heaven
       knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being
       scorched for his wrongdoings
 This display of bravado is no bluff  Ive no fear any God or
      His punishment 

That was my point If I play poker with Monopoly money I can bet 
anything I want

  
 But I shant go to heaven it would be against my sense of
      humanity and compassion for my fellow man

This is exactly why Christianity is missionary in nature
not just out of a need to irritate 8
 
  
 The God of both Testaments are one and the same and in
      neither is there evidence God is strictly love  

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written
there is evidence of love but that is a cultural bias This is
a poor answer which you neednt rebut

I will now pull the old bait and switch

I think you should use the Bible to judge man not God
By that I mean if your moral intuition doesnt like what
is described in the Bible realize that such things are going on
now I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil
and ask what are you doing to fight it Not you specifically
but everyone including myself If I dont like the genocide
in the Bible what about the genocide that goes on right now
To move beyond the question of a hell realize that many people
right now are suffering If you think hell isnt fair and are
willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence
what about how life isnt fair Right now there is a young mother
with three little kids who doesnt know how she will get through
the day Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie
Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to
fix his TV Instead of why doesnt God help them ask why dont
we help them I think you are correct to challenge any Christian
who doesnt live his life with the compassion you seem to possess

You want evidence of God Find someone who is making a difference
someone you admire someone who has been through some tough times
and has come out with his head up Ask the person how he does it Ask 
the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind Ask the 
woman who was pregnant at 15 kept the baby and now is a successful
business woman Ask the doctor who has operated on a 112 pound
baby They wont all be Christians or even what you might
call religious but there will be something in common

God is not defined in the Bible God is defined by what is
in those peoples hearts It doesnt matter if you cant give
intellectual assent to any description youve heard theyre
all wrong anyway The compassion you already feel in your heart 
is a step in the right direction Follow that instead
Then come back and read the Bible and youll see that same
thing described there

  If nothing else makes sense hang on to that idea that God is love
 
 I would say something similar but in reverse order love
      is god

Good I guess we only have to work on your grammar 8
