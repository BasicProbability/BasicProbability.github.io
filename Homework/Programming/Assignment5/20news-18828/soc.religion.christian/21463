Granting that I think Christianity as a relationship with Jesus and
a love for God and ones own soul stands just fine without hell I
dont believe or see any evidence in scripture that hell is presented
as a stick with which to beat people towards heaven

I certainly agree with the last paragraph  Also Jesuss statements on
hell can be treated as totally symbolic allegorical or as parables as
was much of his other teaching  Theres more than enough hell here on earth
that we are freed from by following Jesus that the rest just doesnt mattter
to me  And the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift
God offers  Eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start
partaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification
