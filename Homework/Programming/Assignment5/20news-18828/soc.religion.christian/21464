    My mom passed along a lengthy review she clipped regarding Robin Lane
    Foxs book The Unauthorized Version Truth and Fiction in the Bible

   Ive read the book Some parts were quite typical regarding its
   criticism of the bible as an inaccurate historical document
   altaltheism etc carries typical responses but not as vociferous as
   aa It does give an insight into how these historian is he one I 
   dont have any biodata on him work Ive not been able to understand
   appreciate some of the arguments something like it mentions certain 
   events so it has to be after that event and so on 

Robin Lane Fox is a historian and a gardener  He has written several
history books perhaps a recent one you might remember is The Search
for Alexander  He has also written or edited several books on
gardening
