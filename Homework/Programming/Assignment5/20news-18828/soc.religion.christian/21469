            Fearbased religion is not a faithrelationship with the
 One Who made us all

So does that mean that anyone who is a Christian to avoid Hell isnt really
a Christian at all It sounds like it to me

If thats the ONLY reason Id be inclined to doubt whether or not what
they profess is Christianity  The relationship of faith is based upon
trust  Fear and trust are generally incompatible  If my only motivation
is fear is there room for trust  If so theres room for faith  
If fear precludes trust then there cant be faith
