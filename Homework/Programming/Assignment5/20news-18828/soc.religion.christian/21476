 Any one who thinks that Homosexuality and Christianity are compatible should check  
 out
 	Romans 127
 	I Corinthians 69
 	I Timothy 110
 	Jude 17
 	II Peter 269
 	Gen 19
 	Lev  1822
 to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality

Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
check out Dignity Integrity More Light Presbyterian churches Affirmation
MCC churches etc  Meet some gay Christians find out who they are pray
with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion
