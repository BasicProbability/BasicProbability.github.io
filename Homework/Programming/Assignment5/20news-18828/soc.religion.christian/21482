 4 Nothing unclean shall enter heaven Rev 2127 Therefore
 babies are born in such a state that should they die they are cuf off
 from God and put in hell which is exactly the doctrine of St Augustine
 and St Thomas  

I havent read this entire thread but if someone hasnt tossed this out yet then here it is 

2 Samuel 122123 RSV  

  Then his servants said to him What is this thing that you have
  done You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive but when
  the child died you arose and ate food He David said While the
  child was still alive I fasted and wept for I said Who knows
  whether the LORD will be gracious to me that the child may live But
  now he is dead why should I fast Can I bring him back again I shall
  go to him but he will not return to me

Anyhow many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
where David will someday go I dont claim to know for sure if this
applies to all babies or not But even if its just this one what
would you say to this
