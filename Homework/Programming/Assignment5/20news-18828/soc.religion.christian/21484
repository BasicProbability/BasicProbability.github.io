Like we have never heard of or read these verses before

How about you read them in context taking into consideration the times and 
places in which they were written the local customs and pagan rituals 
what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with 
the rest of the Bible

There are many issues in the Bible that are argued and can be argued 
successfullly from both sides of an issue  Some examples that come to mind
are 
		Gifts of the Spirit
		when the Rapture will occurpre or post tribulation
		how people should be baptized
to name a few

I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me or anyone else for having
a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love even if we are the
same sex

Im sorry if I am coming across as heated  Its just that the Lord has been
so dear to me the last several years and Im tired of hearing this same old
thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for 
themselves

Check it out for yourself  Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you  If I werent
confident of this I wouldnt invite you to do this

God Bless
