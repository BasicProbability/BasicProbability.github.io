None of the states currently recognize samesex marriages but I know
several couples whose marriages are more stable and loving and 
longlasting than most of my legally married friends and relatives
This drives one friends family crazy His brothers have been
divorced twice both his parents are divorced and he  the filthy
gay  has been married to his partner for 20 years

Just because those  marriages are more stable and loving and longlasting
doesnt make it right  Samesex partners could have been best friends
without getting sexually involved with each other
