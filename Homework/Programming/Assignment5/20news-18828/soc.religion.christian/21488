If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesnt the Bible
ever say so  It never comes right and says Only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised

This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies It assumes that
if the Bible doesnt say specifically that you dont need to do something
then that must mean that you do need to do it I know theres a specific
term for this form of logic but it escapes me right now However if it
were sound then you should be able to apply it this way If the Bible
doesnt specifically say that something is wrong then it must be OK
which coincidentally leads perfectly into a question Ive often pondered
If slavery is immoral which I believe it is can I assume that everyone
else in this group does too why doesnt Jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it Owning slaves was common practice back then Paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral He apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard Why
doesnt anyone mention slavery If Gods morals are eternal and dont
change like the morals of society then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today
