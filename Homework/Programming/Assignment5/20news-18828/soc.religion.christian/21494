I am interested in finding out why people become
atheists after having believed in some godGod
In conversing with them on other groups Ive
often sensed anger or hostility   Though I dont
mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile
it does seem to be one motivation for giving up
faith  Thus some atheism might result from 
brokenness

This is condescending at best and a slightly disquised ad hominem
attack This attitude on the part of many theists especially the
vocal ones is one reason for the hostility you sense How do you
like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of
immature emotionalism

I wouldnt and dont  I thought I did a pretty good job of
qualifying my statement but apparently some people
misinterpreted my intentions  I apologize for my part in
communicating any confusion  My intent was more to
stir up discussion rather than judge   It seems to
have worked

rest of post noted  by the way I did not originally post this to
altatheism  If it got there I dont know how it did
