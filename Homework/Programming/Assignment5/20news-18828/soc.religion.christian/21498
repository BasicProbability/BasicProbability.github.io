Subject Re Atheists and Hell

 Imagine the worst depth of despair youve
 ever encountered or the worst physical pain youve ever experienced
 Some people suffer such emotional physical and mental anguish
 in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful But at least
 the pain does end in death What if you lived a hundred such lives
 at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another
 What if you lived a million a billion years in this state
 What if this kept going forever


Did this happen to Jesus I dont think so not from what I heard He lived
ONE DAY of suffering and died If the wages of sin is the above paragraph then
JESUS DIDNT PAY FOR OUR SINS DID HE

This is something Ive always found a little curious Ive never quite understood
the trinity thing On the one hand Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate But
at the same time he is Gods son For God so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son First question is if Jesus was God in human form how could
he really be Gods son If the Holy Ghost planted the seed in Mary so to speak
then it seems that Jesus relationship to God would be the equivalent to the
human fatherson relationship While a son might inherit alot of the fathers 
qualities he is not the father They are still two separite entities To try
and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong In that
case Jesus and God arent the same On the other hand if their relationship
isnt the same as the human fatherson relationship but Jesus is actually God
incarnate then hes not really Gods son and he never was Hes just God
manifesting himself as Jesus At least this is how Im seeing it Can someone
who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us 

Getting back to the original question what is the great price that Jesus paid
to redeem our sins Was it dying on the cross Since Jesus knew that he would
rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven I have a hard time seeing
how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity His earthly body
may have been killed but then so what He suffered a few hours of physical
pain but then there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more
The fact that Jesus was Gods only begotten son doesnt seem to me to have much
meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to Jesus being the only
one was simply a matter of choice I suspect that these questions will be very
offensive to many Christians on this net To those people please accept my
sincere apologies It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ
But I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious
 
Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together
First your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one  In this
group its dangerous to say that no one believes something  You
seem to be suggesting the Jesus is Gods son in a physical sense
with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother  I consider that
terrible heresy though some people react less violently  The Virgin
Birth says that Jesus birth is Gods responsibility  But it doesnt
imply that Gods sperm was involved  Indeed one though by no means
the only speculation is that God used Josephs genetic material

Second Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father  In a
Trinitarian context the term Son refers to the eternal Logos who is
a part of God  The Son didnt come into existence with Jesus birth
Jesus is the incarnation of the Son  So his sonness isnt
specifically a result of being incarnated  Rather its the Son
who was incarnated
