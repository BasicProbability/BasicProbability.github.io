After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months it 
has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
Liberals Catholics New Agers and Athiests  Someone might think 
to change the name to  socreligionany    or   perhaps even
socreligionnew  It might seem to be more appropriate
Heck dont flame me Im Catholic gay and I voted 
for Bill Clinton  Im on your side
