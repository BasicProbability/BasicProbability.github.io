Subject hate the sin

Hate the sin but love the sinnerIve heard that quite a bit recently 
often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality
but the context really isnt that important My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin Ill leave it unnamed
since I dont want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 
do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even 
believe what they are doing is a sin After enough of this the sinner begins
to hate us they certainly dont love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior Hate builds up and drives people away from Godthis certainly
cannot be a good way to build love

In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors He doesnt say anything about hate In fact if anything he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves So how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin either in others or ourselvesthrough prayer We
need to ask God to help us with our own sin and to help those we love 
with theirs Only love can conquer sinhatred has no place The best way to
love someone is to pray for them
