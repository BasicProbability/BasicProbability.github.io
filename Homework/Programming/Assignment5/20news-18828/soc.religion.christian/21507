Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spiritled course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know  I suggest that
you stop prooftexting about things you know nothing about

Let me say that the life death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is
central to Christianity If you personally believe that Jesus Christ
died for you you are a part of the Christian body of believers

We are all still human We dont know it all but homosexual or heterosexual
we all strive to follow Jesus  The world is dying and needs to hear about
Jesus Christ

Are you working together with other Christians to spread the Gospel
