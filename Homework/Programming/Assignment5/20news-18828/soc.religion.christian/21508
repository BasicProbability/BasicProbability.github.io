Subject Re Deuterocanicals eps Sirach

Thanks for the responses so far I hope that I have 
sparked some thought which is more my intent than 
to restart one of the Reformations

Im just going to tug on two threads

	And I must point out that
the Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD 60 years after the founding
of the Christian Religion upon the Cross  Why should we adhere to a
canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the Chrsitian
use of the Greek Septuagint which includes the deuterocanon  

I was simply observing that as a nonJew I am not in that community
which might be bound by such a decision I dont know much about
the Council of Jamnia but I have heard that it is not wellattested
historically Faithless has nothing to do with it and I prefer
not to speculate about motives

As early
as 150 AD St Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the
Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books  

I wish the DialoguewithTrypho were a real transcript of a real
dialogue but I think it a fictional effect on Justins part
Putting that to one side Justins point may be evidential one
would want to know which books

Protestants apparently prefer to think that Gods revelation was limited 
by a decree of the Jews 

Perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light MS evidence
they had Lets stick to the issues Again I prefer not to speculate
about motives One would need quotes from Luther Calvin etc to
evidence this preference

That is not quite accurate  Otherwise we would have the book
of Enoch in the canon as Dave noted  One can say that the 
apocrypha are not quoted by Christ  

Is this the principle Any BC text not quoted by Christ cannot
be counted as Scripture  Think well about this Job Ruth

I wrote
 		These is a logically invalid a priori 
 		Besides we are talking about OT texts 
 		which in many parts are superceded by the NT
 		in the Xtian view Would not this same
 		principle exclude Ecclesiastes
 		This principle cannot be consistently applied

I have to reject your argument here  The Spirit speaks with one
voice and he does not contradict himself  

Meaning what Do you affirm the principle that the Dcs can be
excluded since they contain false doctrine or do you deny it 
If affirmed as is implied in your statement how does one determine 
that doctrine X is false Do you affirm every teaching in Ecclesiastes

The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired
by the Spirit ie Godbreathed  It is a test which is more
guided by faith than by reason or logic  

If so it may be a test that cannot be applied The Orthodox
faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical How can my
faith say Not  All I hear here is the a priori I mentioned
before

The deuterocanonical books were added much later in the churchs
history  

This is contrary to fact

They do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of Scripture  

Can this be elevated to a principle How is spiritual quality
measured Ill take the spiritual quality of most of Sirach over 
Joshua or Chronicles any day

I do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the Spirit in so doing  

What can I say You believe what you believe Im asking for
a consistency check I dont see that the books were added in any
construction this formulation begs the question No one can validly
ask me to have faith that these books are noncanonical

These are my opinions  activities alone

QOTD

Christianity is not a doctrine not I mean a theory about what has
 happened and will happen to the human soul but a description of something
 that actually takes place in a human life  For consciousness of sin is a
 real event and so are despair and salvation through faith  Those who speak
 of such things Bunyan for instance are simply describing what has happened
 to them whatever anyone may want to say about it  Ludwig Wittgenstein
