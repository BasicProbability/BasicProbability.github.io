to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality

Homosexual Christians have indeed checked out these verses  Some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations
Others simply do not address the issues

You would seem to be more in need of a careful and Spiritled course
in exegesis than most of the gay Christians I know  I suggest that
you stop prooftexting about things you know nothing about

Well Michael  I dont know if clh has left them in the faq  Maybe you should
post the how to get there map again but I posted two or three lengthy
exegetical paper on these verses  They looked at the OT NT and
intertestimental usages of terms in reference  I would suggest you read those
before you talk about a need in exegetical studies  If those arent enough
I could also provide The source and NT Meaning of Apsevokoitai  Dr James
DeYoung published it in THE MASTERS SEMINARY JOURNAL in fall of 92  To read
any of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
for honest exegesis

Again please refer to the faq file or if you are unable to acess it drop me
a line and I will enclose them to you

yesterday  clh
