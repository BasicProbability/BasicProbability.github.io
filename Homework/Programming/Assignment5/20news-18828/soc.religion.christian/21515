 In the NT the clear references are all from Pauls letters  In Rom
 1 there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil
 Note that the passage isnt about homosexuality  its about
 idolatry  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment or at
 least result of idolatry  There are a number of arguments over this
 passage  It does not use the word homosexuality and it is referring
 to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality
 So its not what Id call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality

Thats like saying that murder is only wrong for those of us who arent natural
murders and stealing is only wrong for those of us who arent natural
thieves
