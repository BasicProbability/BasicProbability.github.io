     I have a question about Satan  I was taught a long time ago
that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
because he challenged Gods authority  The problem is I cannot
find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it
originate

	The quick answer  Revelation 1279


And as someone mentioned earlier from the apocryphal Book of Enoch
satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will
I will  Hmmmprochoice looks kinda creepy here

Then there are the references around the Bible about taking a third
of the angels getting a third of the heavens or something
