This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults since
both have souls  Infants must be baptized therefore or they cannot
enter into Heaven  They too need this form of life in them or they
cannot enter into Heaven

Are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking Jesus to come into
your heart and accepting him as your savior but is just a ritual that we
must go through to enable us to enter Heaven


	My feeling on baptism is this  parents baptize their baby so that the
	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism and thus removal of original
	sin on its soul in the event of an unexpected death
	
	That is the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young
	to speak on its own  This should not surprise anyone  dont parents
	always do what they believe is the best for their baby  Why would
	that apply to the babys physical needs only but not hisher spiritual
	needs to have Gods grace
	
	The purpose of confirmation is for the baby now young adult to 
	decide to reaffirm for himselfherself the promises that hisher
	parents made at baptism  That is where accepting Jesus into your
	heart comes in  In baptism the parents ask Jesus to come into their
	babys heart at confirmation the child repeats that request 
	independently
	
	By the way these are my personal feelings though I believe they are
	pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on
	this issue  Can anyone out there back me up or correct me
