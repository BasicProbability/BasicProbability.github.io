Subject The Bible on the Immaculate COnception

Andy Byler writes on the Biblical basis for the dogma of the
Immaculate Conception

   I will put enmity between you the Serpent and the woman and
  between your seed and her seed she can also be read he shall
  crush your head and you shall bruise her or his heel
  Genesis 315

   He who commits sin is of the devil     1 John 38

   Hail full of grace greek  kecharitomene the Lord is with
  thee     Luke 128

In the Hebrew of Genesis 315 the gender is clearly masculine

  HE shall crush your head and you shall bruise HIS heel

The Latin has feminine forms only by an accident of grammar

Andrew stated that KECHARITOMENE means not just full of grace but
having a plenitude or perfection of grace The word is used
elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 16

  Unto the praise of the glory of his grace in which he hath
  GRACED us in his beloved Son RheimsDouay translation

I cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies
anything as strong as Andrew suggests nor does the Ephesians
passage suggest that the verb means to preserve from any taint of
original or actual sin from the first moment of existence I should
like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb preferably not
from s writer who is discussing Luke 128 at the moment

 Yours
 James Kiefer
