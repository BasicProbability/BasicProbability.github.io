Im fairly new to these groups tho some have heard from me before
Welcome

Id like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents
In normal dreams you cant control anything so obviously
you arent morally responsible for your actions

Hm I get a little queasy around the phrase arent morally 
responsible perhaps because Ive heard it misused so many times
I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who
was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions In general
most folk cant control their dreams but perhaps what you do all day
and think about has some impact on them hm And Im not sure what
actions are in a dream But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant
about the fact that our thoughtlife is at least as important as
our actions Go lightly with this argument  we are all morally
responsible for who we are and dreams might well be an important
part of that

Now there seem to be 3 alternatives
1 Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena  In this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called mental hygiene that is not trying
to think about anything evil or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts
I dont know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences Ive had dreams some
fairly vivid ones is an OOBE just a very vivid dream I would argue that
extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky it is probably
much better to think about who Jesus is and who we are in relation to that
than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams Unless you feel plagued by
dreams that are painful and out of control then pray about it andor get help

2 Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ie are another plane
Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in
common by more than one person
What on Earth is your definition of often I know exactly one case of
two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time and
as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could
see why their dreams might be similiar Anyway the only other plane I
know of is the spiritual realm I dont think anyones dreams
perhaps outside the occasional prophets represent actual actions on an
alternate plane If they were real actions or conscious thoughts then
yes they would have direct moral significance

3 Like 2 but here we assume that garbled text because the dream occurs
in a different environment then different moral laws apply is my guess of
what you said
I dont see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones environment
changes the way a person determines what is moral For a Christian wont
it always come down to what Jesus would have us do

So There it is  Is one of these cases the truth or does anyone know
of another alternative  respond by post or email
Truth I dont claim to be an expert in dreams Ill note that the Bible
doesnt talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak
to us with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear as it
warns somewhere in the OT Given that I would not give them a lot of
attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something

I would discount talk of alternate planes though The only places such
concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to
Christianity though Ive run into the occasional exception If you are
or want to be a Christian you want to be very careful about ideas like
this
