2 Samuel 122123 RSV  

Anyhow many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
where David will someday go I dont claim to know for sure if this
applies to all babies or not But even if its just this one what
would you say to this

   That brings up an interesting question  If this interpretation is
correct how would these people be getting into Heaven before Jesus
opened the gates of Heaven
