If babies are not supposed to be baptised then why doesnt the Bible
ever say so  It never comes right and says Only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised

This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies It assumes that
if the Bible doesnt say specifically that you dont need to do something
then that must mean that you do need to do it I know theres a specific
term for this form of logic but it escapes me right now However if it
were sound then you should be able to apply it this way If the Bible
doesnt specifically say that something is wrong then it must be OK
which coincidentally leads perfectly into a question Ive often pondered

   This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is
not in the Bible then it must not be done  But I dont really
think thats what hes saying anyway  See below

If slavery is immoral which I believe it is can I assume that everyone
else in this group does too why doesnt Jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it Owning slaves was common practice back then Paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral He apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard Why
doesnt anyone mention slavery If Gods morals are eternal and dont
change like the morals of society then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today

   What about the letter to Philemon  In it Paul at least hints that a
certain slave be released  Also slavery in those times was not the
same as the type of slavery we had in the US  I think a better
comparison would be to indentured servitude  I dont really want to get
into a discussion on slavery  Anyway although it does demonstrate your
point I dont think it is relevent because the original poster did not
say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not
immoral

   Back to the original posters assertion  He is not in fact making
the logical error of which you accuse him  He stated the fact that the
Bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized  Also we know that
the Bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter Heaven
Everyone includes infants unless there is other Scripture to the
contrary ie an exception  Since there is no exception listed in the
Bible we must assume to be on the safe side that the Bible means what
it says that everyone must be baptized to enter Heaven  And so we
baptize infants

   To summarize you accused the original poster of saying if something
is not forbidden by the Bible then that proves it is OK ie if
something cannot be disproven it is true  He rather seemed to be
asserting that since the Bible does not forbid you cannot prove
using the Bible that it is not OK  There is a difference between
proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven there are
theories on provability in the field of Logic by the way and actually
proving or disproving it  The other logical error we must avoid falling
into is the converse that if something cannot be proven then it is
false  This seems to be the error of many sola scriptura believers

   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use
Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism
although the evidence seems to me to favor it
