Hmmmin the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels  After all THEY were not punished in any manner

If the languages we sepak are the result of Babel then it stands to
reason that angels would speak a different language from us  You do 
have a valid point about multiple angelic languages  But angelic
beings maybe of different species so to speak  maybe different species
communicate differently  

I dont know either  Truth be known so little is known of angels
to even guess  All we really know is that angels ALWAYS speak in
the nativ tongue of the person theyre talking to so perhaps they
dont have ANY language of their own

Trouble is while such stories abound any and all attempts at
verification and we are to test the spirit either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances or that outright
fabrication was involved  The Brother Puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing  And linguistically a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language inflection or no

I have heard an eyewitness account myself  Such things are hard to prove
They dont lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well  I dont
know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway

Well we are told to test the spirits  While you could do this
scripturally to see if someones claims are backed by the bible
I see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy Lazarus really
was dead and now hes alive

Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay

Thats an unprovable statement  How can you prove if somethings been proved
There is no way to know that youve seen all the evidence  Once I 
saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of
his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer  

Its a common fallacy you commit  The nonfalsifiability trick  How
can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen  Answer  I
cant  The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove 
anything  

When I say it has never been proven Im talking about the ones
making the claims not the skeptics who are doing the proving

The burden of proof rest with the claimant  Unfortunately 
pontification warning our legal system seems to be headed in
the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence end
pontification

But truthfully Corinthians was so poorly written or maybe just
so poorly translated into English that much remains unknown
about just what Paul really intended despite claims of hard
proof one way or another  Some will see his writings in
1 cor 1214 as saying dont do this dont do this and using
sarcasm metaphor etc while yet others take what he says literally
sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding

Me  When I read 1 Cor 14 about prayingspeaking in tongues regarding
building oneselfthe church I see him using comparecontrast
saying do this because it build the church while doing this
builds onself implying dont do that  Its a common usage
of writing that we all employ and it is easily seen how it
COULD be interpreted this way  Why some do and some dont is
a mystery
