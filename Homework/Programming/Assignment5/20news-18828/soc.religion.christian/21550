Doesnt the Bible say that God is a fair god sic  If this is true
how can this possibly be fair to the infants

Andrew Byler writes

What do you mean fair  God is just giving to everyone what they
deserve As all infants are in sin from the time of conception cf
Romans 512 Psalm 17 they cannot possibly merit heaven and as
purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins it
is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven

Why is it fair to punish you me and the rest of humanity because of
what Adam and Eve did Suppose your parents committed some crime before
you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in
jail for it Would you really think that is fair I know I wouldnt

Well suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack userabuser while
she was pregnant Suppose your husband gave you some SDT this recently
happened to a close friend of my wife and mine

OFTEN the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on
innocent people Several times in the OT this is pointed out even
saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a persons sin
for several generations Even today we see multigenerational to
coin a phrase effects from alcoholism child abuse and spousal
abuse just to name three

So Gods definition of fair and ours differ

Some points of perspective

Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred see Websters
first definition of inbred thanks to Adam it is arrogant and foolish
for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in
their shoes I know myself pretty well and Im just not that good Take
Gods word for it neither are you There is no one righteous

More important when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus God
promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical selfs sinful
tendency We can of course choose to ignore this help Rom 78

God made mankind upright but men have gone in search of many
schemes Eccl
