Subject Re How I got saved

Hello Brycen 
Im a Norwegian journalist student  and also a Christian Thanks for your 
testimony But I want to ask you one question What do you think of Heavy 
Metal music after you became a Christian You know there are Christian bands 
like Barren Cross Whitecross Bloodgood and Stryper that play that kind of 
music I like some of it I feel like it sometimes Of course I listen to 
the lyrics too I dont listen to any Christian band but its better than 
listening to secular music anyway 
Hope youre still going strong  with Christ
