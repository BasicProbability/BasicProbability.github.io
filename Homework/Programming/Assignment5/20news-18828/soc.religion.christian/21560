1 Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena  In this case no morality

2 Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ie are another plane

3 Like 2 but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have 
a
real existence a different moralethics apply there and no or maybe 
different moral laws apply there


I can think of another alternative

4  OOBEs are a form of contact with the demonic world whereby one 
intentionally or unintentionally surrenders control of his or her perceptions 
to spiritual beings whose purpose is to deceive and entrap them
