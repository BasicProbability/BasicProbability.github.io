Hmmmin the old testament story about the tower of Babel we see how
God PUNISHED by giving us different language  Can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all that they have the SAME one
amongst other angels  After all THEY were not punished in any manner


Maybe before Babeleveryone including angels spoke the same languageso at
Babel God punished us by giving us languages different from the original one
So if thats the casethen angels now would be speaking in the tongue  mankind
spoke before Babel
