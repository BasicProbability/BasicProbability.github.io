 You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
 that are spiritfilled believers not MCCrs before you go lumping us all
 together with Troy Perry  
 

 Gee I think there are some real criminals robbers muderers drug
 addicts who appear to be fun loving caring people too  So whats
 your point  Is it OK just because the people are nice

The point is not about being nice  Nice is not a christian virtue  The
point is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit by their fruits you shall
know them Mt 720 are manifested by and among prayerful spiritfilled
GAY christians  It was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles
that convinced Peter Acts 10 that his prejudice against them based on
scripture I might add was not in accordance with Gods intentions

 I think the old saying  hate the sin and not the sinner is
 appropriate here  Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably
 dont hate the people  I dont  I dont hate my kids when they do
 wrong either  But I tell them what is right and if they lie or dont
 admit they are wrong or just dont make an effort to improve or
 repent they get punished  I think this is quite appropriate  You
 may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here
 Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through
 feel goodism  Maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more
 than God  Kind of like the Adam and Eve story  Read it and compare
 it to todays mentality  You may be suprised

Of course the whole issue is one of discernment  It may be that Satan
is trying to convince us that we know more than God  Or it may be that
God is trying as God did with Peter to teach us something we dont
know that God shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears
him and does what is right is acceptable to him Acts 103435
