Subject Re Mormon beliefs about children born out of wedlock

Bruce Webster writes
Indeed LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their childrens sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly cf DC 682528 note that this
passage applies it only to members of the LDS church

Hi Bruce  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18
Ezekiel 1820 The soul who sins is the one who will die  The son will not
share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the
son  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

Is Ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps

Sincerely

Aaron Cardenas

PS I too am bothered to see offensive words being posted on this
newsgroup  Obscenity is out of place for anyone who wants to live by the
Bible Eph 54

Moderator  I would appreciate your not letting posts with foul language
through which has happened at least twice lately  Thank you

I try to avoid foul language  Bastard is certainly foul language
when shouted at someone as an insult  But in this case it was being
used in its original technical sense  Similarly hell is an obscenity
in some contexts but not when referring to the afterlife  It is not
clear to me that bastard is foul language when its being used in its
proper meaning  One of todays postings quotes Deut 232  Am I
to prohibit that  clh
