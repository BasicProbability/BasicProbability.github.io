of Faith if you want to know I feel that faith is intellectually
dishonest 

Id appreciate some support for this statement  Im not sure
it really makes sense to me

I define faith as belief in the abscensesp of evidence I also
include in evidence past experiences Because I have no past experience
in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never
seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the
neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional
works I have read And other reasons I do not believe in any gods
From what I have seen some people reconcile this lack of evidence by
using faith
It is faith in that sense the only way I currently understand the word
faith that I find intellectually dishonest

The ambiguity of religious beliefs an unwillingness to take
Pascals Wager 

Ive heard this frequently  what exactly is Pascals wager

Pascals wager goes something like this
Premise 1 Either there is or there isnt a God
Premise 2 If God exists He wants us to believe and will damn us for not
believing
Premise 3 If God does not exist then belief in God doesnt matter
because death is death anyway
Conclusion Belief in God is superior to nonbelief because
nonbelief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong while belief in
God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong

Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound The problem is
Premise 1 presupposes 11 odds between belief and nonbelief This is
flat out wrong because of the sheer number of religions out there and the
fact that for the most part the religions are mutually exclusive I have
heard theists referred to as 99 atheists because they believe in their
god or gods to be the one god or set of gods The consequence of
this is what if I pick the wrong god Suddenly the odds dont look so
good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still
leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another
gods version of hell

	Do I sound broken to you

I dont know  You point out that your mothers treatment upset you
and see inconsistencies in various religions  Im not sure if that
constitutes brokenness or not   It certainly consititutes 
disillusionment

I dont see how disillusionment enters into it You see I presented my
mothers treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism a
questioning which continues to this day I had already been an atheist for
five years before having any contact with my mothers version of
Christianity If anything I had become somewhat disillusioned with
atheism uh oh I thought What if there is a God Yes in a way I
have also become disillusioned by many religions simply because I had
thought at one time that they had all the answers if I only found the
right one
Im still looking but each time I look in a different place I become a
little stronger in my attitude belief if you will no faith though
its based on the evidence of past experience that Ill never find a
religion which has all the answers
Sorta like looking for Easter eggs The more time it takes you to find the
next one the more convinced you become that you may already have found
all the eggs youre going to find
Someone else mentioned that critisism isnt going to make me think any
more highly of Christians I have a contrary position Constructive
critisism will likely improve my attitude towards Christians Abusive
critisism will turn me off
No accusations to you Mr Sapienza I merely slipped that into this post
because I forgot to reply to that one
