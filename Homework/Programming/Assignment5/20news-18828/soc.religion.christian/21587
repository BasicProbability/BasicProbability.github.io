The ambiguity of religious beliefs an unwillingness to take
Pascals Wager 

 Ive heard this frequently  what exactly is Pascals wager

Either A God exists or B He doesnt  We have two choices either
1 Believe in God or 2 Dont believe in God  If A is true then 2
brings eternal damnation whereas 1 brings eternal life  If B is
true then 1 has minor inconvenience compared with 2  Thus it is
rational to believe in God

This has numerous flaws covered in the FAQ for altatheism amongst
other places

	Do I sound broken to you

 I dont know  You point out that your mothers treatment upset you
 and see inconsistencies in various religions  Im not sure if that
 constitutes brokenness or not   It certainly consititutes 
 disillusionment

Disillusionment strikes me as an excellent reason for stopping
believing in something
