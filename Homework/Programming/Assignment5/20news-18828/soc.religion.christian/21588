Subject Re FAQ essay on homosexuality

I have some articles available on the Church and gay people from
a progay viewpoint which might interest some of the people 
participating in this thread  Please email me if you would like
to have me send them to you warning about 70k worth of material
Make sure you have mailbox andor disk space available

There are no short answers to the questions weve been seeing here
how do you explain these verses How do you justify your actions
If youve been asking and you really want an idea of the other peoples
thinking I encourage you to do some serious reading
