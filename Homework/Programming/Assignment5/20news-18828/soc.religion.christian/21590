he can especially homosexuality  Lets reach the homosexuals for Christ 
Lets not try to change them just need to bring them to Christ  If He
doesnt want them to be gay He can change that  

dont hate the people  I dont  I dont hate my kids when they do
wrong either  But I tell them what is right and if they lie or dont
admit they are wrong or just dont make an effort to improve or
repent they get punished  I think this is quite appropriate  

Note the difference here One is saying if Christ disagrees with 
a Christian being gay Christ can change that

The other is saying if I think being gay is wrong that a Christian
cannot be gay I need to tell them to change


As Lois said and as before her Paul wrote to the believers in Rome
WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE ANOTHERS SERVANT
