Id like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot  What moralsethics apply to dreams and outofbody incidents
In normal dreams you cant control anything so obviously
you arent morally responsible for your actions  But if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE it seems like a morality applies


Well I am one of those apparently odd people who can sometimes
control their dreams  For example I might decide before going to
sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream or dream about a
specific place  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream I can often
not always redirect events to something more pleasant

I guess I think that the same standards apply in these directed
dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life ref Jesus teaching
about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing
adultary

When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose
to dream about I take that as a sign that all is not well with my
inner life  maybe I have underlying tenstionsfears that need to be
resolved or maybe its straightforward sin  In either case the cause
needs to be resolved  

In fact either case is pretty rare  I dont
often remember dreams that I dont chose to have  When I do they
almost always tell me something important
I also almost never dream in pictures and especially not in colour
in fact Ive had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can
remember and it was definately spiritually important
I tend to dream in sound with the odd blurred image in black and
white

Interesting topic  Ill be fascinated to read other responses

PS Just to make it clear I dont do  and have never tried  OOBEs
    I tend to think they are off limits for Christians
