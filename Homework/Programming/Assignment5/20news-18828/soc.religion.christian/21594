 I dont necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it since I see  
no 
 Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy  
 But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices parallel 
 Mormon temple ceremonies  Could you give an example  Also why do they only 
 parallel Mormon ceremonies  Why dont Mormon ceremonies restore the original 
 Christian practices  Wasnt that the whole point of Joseph Smiths stated 
 mission
 

Id recommend reading Mormonism and Early Christianity by Hugh Nibley  
particularly the articles on Christs fortyday postresurrection mission  
baptism for the dead early Christian prayer circles and temples 2 articles
