But I am interested in your claim that early Christian practices parallel 
Mormon temple ceremonies  Could you give an example  Also why do they only 
parallel Mormon ceremonies  Why dont Mormon ceremonies restore the original 
Christian practices  Wasnt that the whole point of Joseph Smiths stated 
mission

If you want parallels the best source is probably the book Temple
and Cosmos by Hugh Nibley  It is not light reading however

As to why these early practices only parallel and do not exactly
duplicate the modern LDS ceremony there are a couple of reasons

1  Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient
times  This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces
undoubtedly spread  Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony
get known  What we have in the 40 day literature the Egyptian
ceremonies and certain Native American ceremonies is almost
certainly not exactly what Jesus taught

2  Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the
situation much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the
audiovisual tools now available
