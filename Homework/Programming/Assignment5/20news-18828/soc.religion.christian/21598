 You might visit some congregations of Christians who happen to be homosexuals
 that are spiritfilled believers not MCCrs before you go lumping us all
 together with Troy Perry  

 Gee I think there are some real criminals robbers muderers drug
 addicts who appear to be fun loving caring people too  So whats
 your point  Is it OK just because the people are nice

I didnt say to visit some nice homosexuals  I said visit some congregations
of Christiansspiritfilled believers


Praise the Lord that we are all members of the same body  Let us agree to
disagree

God Bless You and See you in Heaven
