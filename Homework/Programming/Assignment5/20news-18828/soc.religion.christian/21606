Subject Re The doctrine of Original Sin

Eugen Bigelow writes

It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus attitude He had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon John
10316 and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus 
that in the law prophets and psalms which referred to him  the 
OT division of Scripture Luke 2444 as well as in Luke 1151
taking Genesis to Chronicles the jewish order  we would say
Genesis to Malachi as Scripture

You should remember that in Adams transgression all men and women
sinned as Paul wrote  All of humanity cooperativley reblled against
God in Admas sin thus all are subject to it and the sin is
transmitted from generation to generation
