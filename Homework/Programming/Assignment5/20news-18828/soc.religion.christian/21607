Hello all
     I have a question about Satan  I was taught a long time ago
that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
because he challenged Gods authority  The problem is I cannot
find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it
originate
Wondering
Eddie
 
Hi Eddie many people believe the battle described in Rev 12712
describes the casting out of Satan from heaven and his fall to the
earth
