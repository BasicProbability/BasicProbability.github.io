I dont necessarily object to the secrecy but I do question it since I see no 
Biblical reason why any aspect of Christian worship should involve secrecy  

Early in Church history the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration 
of the Eucharist  It WAS secret giving rise to the rumors that Christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims  The actions were considered
too holy to be observed by nonChristians as well as potentially dangerous
for the individual Christian who might be identified
