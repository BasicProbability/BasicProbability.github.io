Subject Re Christianity and repeated lives

In article May11023837199328288athosrutgersedu KEVXUcunyvmbitnet writes

Isnt Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among Christian thinkers  What were his views and how did he relate them
to the Christian scriptures

He appears to have believed that  He had a view which was condemned by conciliar
action which is often taken to be condemnation of the idea of reincarnation
What was actually condemned was the doctrine of the preexistence of the soul
before birth  Similar but not exactly the same thing
