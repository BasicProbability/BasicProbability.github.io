Subject Re Homosexuality issues in Christianity

In article 28328athosrutgersedu carlsonab24larcnasagov Ann Carlson writes
Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
check out Dignity Integrity More Light Presbyterian churches Affirmation
MCC churches etc  Meet some gay Christians find out who they are pray
with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion

If you were to start your own religion this would be fine  But there
is no scriptural basis for your statement in fact it really gets to
the heart of the problem  You think you know more than scripture
Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God  Just
because they are nice people doesnt make it right  You can start all
the churches you want and it wont change the fact that it is wrong
That is not to imply that gays dont deserve the same love and
forgiveness that anyone else does  But to call their behavior right
just because they are nice people is baseless and it offers Satan a
perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing

I suspect Ann was suggesting that you look to see whether the
Spirit is alive among them not whether they are nice people
though theres something to be said for being nice too clh
