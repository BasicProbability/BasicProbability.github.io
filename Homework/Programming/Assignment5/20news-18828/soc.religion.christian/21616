Subject Re MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY

In article May11023709199328123athosrutgersedu you write
 
 I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox to
 the extent that wellmeaning people think theyve just flatout
 confused  Theres no problem with things being both 3 and 1 eg  if
 the 3 are different parts of the 1  
 But theyre in some way
 different aspects modes or whatever of one God  If you accept
 economic trinitarianism its possible that you dont have any
 substantive difference with the standard view  Is it possible that
 you just dont find the neoPlatonic explanation illuminating
 clh

I would put it stronger than that  I consider it nonsense

Simply put I do not see any way that a Platonic essence could have
any real existance  Essence in the Platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as I can tell  it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways

So to attribute an essence to God is to attribute to him something that
does not exist  Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave
the unity of God in limbo since it is based on a nonexistant essence
thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address

Thus to me the unity of God must be primary and the triality must be
secondary must be modal or aspectual relating to roles or to modes
of interaction since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one

I think one can read Augustine as saying something consistent with
your comments  His De Trinitate  which has been very influential
in the West  defines the distinction among the persons relationally
Youre probably at one extreme of orthodox views but Im not sure
your views are necessary incompatible with the Trinity  clh
