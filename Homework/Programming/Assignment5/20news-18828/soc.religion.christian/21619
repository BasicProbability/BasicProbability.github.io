Subject Re Baptism requires Faith

Aaron  Aaron Bryce Cardenas aaroncathenamitedu writes

Aaron Colossians 21112 In him you were also circumcised in the
Aaron putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done
Aaron by Christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised
Aaron with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him
Aaron from the dead

Aaron In baptism we are raised to a new life in Christ Romans 64
Aaron through a personal faith in the power of God  Our parents
Aaron faith cannot do this  Do infants have faith  Lets look at
Aaron what the Bible has to say about it

Yes let do  Try 

And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me
to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea
with a large millstone tied around his neck  Mark 942

Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these  I tell you
the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God
like a little child will never enter it

The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement
for baptism  It merely says that in baptism we are born again
regenerated and resurrected through faith  In the case
of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the
heart of the infantthrough the power of the word

The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision
Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made
a part of Gods covenant with Israel  It was commanded to be
performed on the eighth day  The early church understood this
and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the
eighth day or if it could in fact be done earlier

Aaron Romans 101617 But not all the Israelites accepted the good
Aaron news  For Isaiah says Lord who has believed our message
Aaron Consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the
Aaron message is heard through the word of Christ

Aaron So then we receive Gods gift of faith to us as we hear the
Aaron message of the gospel  

And the gospel is surely preached at any infants or adults
baptism  Indeed in a very real sense the sacraments are
the Gospel made tangible

Aaron Faith is a possible response to hearing
Aaron Gods word preached  Kids are not yet spiritually
Aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to
Aaron Gods word  

How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith
Do you know this on the basis of Gods Word or from your own
reason

Faith is also described as a gift from God Ephesians 289 
He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults through
the power of the gospel Romans 16

Aaron If you read all of Ezekiel 18 you will see that God doesnt
Aaron hold us guilty for anyone elses sins  So we can have no
Aaron original guilt from Adam

Here you show that you just dont understand original sin
you are arguing against a straw man
Maybe youve been talking to Catholics too much  I dont
know  But original sin does not consist of Gods imputation
of Adams guilt to us  It consists of our inheritance of
Adams sinful nature  It is actual sin  See for example
the Augsburg Confession Article II and the Apology of the
Augsburg Confession Article II and for extra credit
John Knoxs The Scots confession Article III

Aaron Now then that we have a little more background as to why
Aaron original sin is not Biblical lets look at some of the
Aaron scriptures used to support it

Aaron Romans 512 Therefore just as sin entered the world through
Aaron one man and death through sin and in this way death came to
Aaron all men because all sinned


Ask yourself this question  Do infants ever die  Then ask
yourself If infant baptism is not valid then where was the
Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all 
of the baptisms were performed on infants  Were Luther Melancthon
Calvin Zwingli Hus Knox Andrae and Chemnitz Christians


Aaron Psalm 515 Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time
Aaron my mother conceived me

Aaron This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble
Aaron ourselves before God in repentance for sinning  David himself
Aaron was a man after Gods own heart and wrote the Psalm after
Aaron committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband
Aaron All that David is saying here is that he cant remember a time
Aaron when he wasnt sinful  He is humbling himself before God by
Aaron confessing his sinfulness  His saying that he was sinful at
Aaron birth is a hyperbole  The Bible being inspired by God isnt
Aaron limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of
Aaron speech as did Jesus John 1625  For another example of
Aaron hyperbole see Luke 1426

Who are you to say what is literal and what is not  Is a literal
interpretation manifestly absurd in Psalm 51 by reason of direct
contradiction with a clear passage from the Word of God

You might also compare Genesis 821 The LORD smelled the
pleasing aroma and said in his heart Never again will I curse
the ground because of man even though every inclination of
his heart is evil from childhood

Aaron We see
Aaron that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 240 and 252  The
Aaron implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he
Aaron knew to choose right over wrong

You are a long way from proving this rather monstrous assertion
All you can say is that Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature  A
conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation
of reason not on a direct revelation in Scripture

David H Wagner			But mad reason rushes forth and
a confessional Lutheran		because Baptism is not dazzling like
				the works which we do
				regards it as worthless
				Martin Luther Large Catechism
				Fourth Part Baptism
