 After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months it 
 has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
 Liberals Catholics New Agers and Athiests  Someone might think 
 to change the name to  socreligionany    or   perhaps even
 socreligionnew  It might seem to be more appropriate
 Heck dont flame me Im Catholic gay and I voted 
 for Bill Clinton  Im on your side                      

Since when did conservative protestant oldtime religion believers get
an exclusive francise to christianity  Christianity is and always has
been a diverse and contentious tradition and this group reflects that
diversity  I fo one am not ready to concede to any group be they
liberal or conservative catholic protestant or orthodox charismatic
or not the right to claim that they have the truth and everyone else
is not christian
