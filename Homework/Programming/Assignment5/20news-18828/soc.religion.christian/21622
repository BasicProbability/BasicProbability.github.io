 After reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months it 
 has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
 Liberals Catholics New Agers and Athiests  Someone might think 
 to change the name to  socreligionany    or   perhaps even
 socreligionnew  It might seem to be more appropriate
 Heck dont flame me Im Catholic gay and I voted 
 for Bill Clinton  Im on your side                      

My sentiments exactly which is why Im unsubbing from this group
This is the 3rd christian discussion list I have ever belonged to
and once again Im being chased away by the strife anger discontent
lies et al 

As Paul Saul said I come to preach Christ and Him crucified
Dont let the simple beauty of faith in God get overshadowed by heady
theological discussions or thousands of lines of postincarnation
trappings of some church


As for the atheistsagnostics who read this list if you arent
christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on
earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian
discussion list 

I will continue to search for christian discussion prayerful spiritfilled
kind humble patient etc in other circles

Im afraid that any discussion group containing people with different
views tends to turn into arguments about the largest differences
present  So talkreligionmisc spends a lot of time on
Christianatheist arguments socreligionchristian spends a lot of
time on arguments among different christian groups and the bitnet
Catholic group spends a lot of time on arguments between conservative
and liberal Catholics  Personally I would prefer to have a set of
somewhat more specialized groups at least as an alternative  Liberal
and conservative Protestant and Catholic would handle most of the
traffic though there are certainly significant groups eg
Orthodox  Of course it may be that most of our readers like the
arguments  I certainly find it painful moderating them  clh
