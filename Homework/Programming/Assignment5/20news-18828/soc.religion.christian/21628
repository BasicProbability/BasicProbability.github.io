Subject Re The doctrine of Original Sin

In article May1204291419939997athosrutgersedu mdw33310uxacsouiucedu Michael D Walker writes

	My feeling on baptism is this  parents baptize their baby so that the
	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism and thus removal of original
	sin on its soul in the event of an unexpected death

You are right Michael

In John 35 Jesus says Amen amen I say to you no one can enter the
kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit  Thats really what
He said and He meant it  That verse is the definition of baptism  I dont
have the law book in front of me but there is a canon law that urges
parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very
reason that you state
