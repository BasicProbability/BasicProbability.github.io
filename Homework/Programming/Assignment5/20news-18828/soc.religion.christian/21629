Subject Re hate the sin

scottprismgatechedu Scott Holt writes
 Hate the sin but love the sinnerIve heard that quite a bit recently 
 often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality
 but the context really isnt that important My question is whether that
 statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

Im very grateful for scotts reflections on this oftquoted phrase  Could
someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it  Rom 129 doesnt
count kids  The manner in which this little piece of conventional wisdom is
applied has in my experience been uniformly hateful and destructive
