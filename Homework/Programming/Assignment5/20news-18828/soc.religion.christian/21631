Subject Re The Bible on the Immaculate COnception

In article May12042948199310041athosrutgersedu JEKcunihgov writes

	  I will put enmity between you the Serpent and the woman and
	 between your seed and her seed she can also be read he shall
	 crush your head and you shall bruise her or his heel
	 Genesis 315

   In the Hebrew of Genesis 315 the gender is clearly masculine

	 HE shall crush your head and you shall bruise HIS heel

   The Latin has feminine forms only by an accident of grammar

I have yet to see an adequate explanation of St Jeromes translation
of Genesis 315  His Latin clearly uses the feminine but I dont
know why since the Hebrew is clearly masculine  If anyone knows of a
scholarly treatment of this puzzle I would appreciate hearing from
you
