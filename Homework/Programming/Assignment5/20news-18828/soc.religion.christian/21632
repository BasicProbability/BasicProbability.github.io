Subject Re Baptism requires Faith

Aaron Bryce Cardenas writes

   Romans 101617 But not all the Israelites accepted the good news  For
   Isaiah says Lord who has believed our message  Consequently faith
   comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word
   of Christ

   So then we receive Gods gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
   gospel  Faith is a possible response to hearing Gods word preached  Kids
   are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to
   respond to Gods word  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
   be raised in baptism to a new life

Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently and thats
one primary reason why they baptize babies  They believe that Baptism
produces a change in the soul of the baby quite independently of any
volitional act on the part of the baby  This change in the babys
soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have
without Baptism  Since the infant does not have the use of his
intellect and will yet these new faculties are dormant  But as the
child gets older the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play

   Ezekiel 1820 The soul who sins will die  The son will not share the
   guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son  The
   righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the
   wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

   If you read all of Ezekiel 18 you will see that God doesnt hold us guilty
   for anyone elses sins  So we can have no original guilt from Adam

Adam was given a number of gifts by God  The chief among them was
what Catholics call sanctifying grace  In the New Testament the
word used for this is charity  By his sin Adam lost this grace
He didnt lose it just for himself however he lost it for the whole
human race  Because once he lost it he couldnt pass it on to his
descendents

Thats why Catholics baptize babies  Through his Original Sin Adam
lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents  Christ instituted
Baptism to give it back to everyone

Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did they
are simply lacking in something they need in order to enter Heaven
