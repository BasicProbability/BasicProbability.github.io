Subject Definition of Christianity

Although simplistic I have always liked the fact that a Christian is one
who not only believes in God but believes God  After all the name was
first given externally to identify those who preached Christ and Him
crucified to pay the price of their rebeliion and shortcomings before
God  God said this was His son  I belive Him

Its certainly a good things for Christians to follow  But as
a definition it may be a bit hard to apply  clh
