Subject Ten Commandments or Ten Discourses

In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks 
I came across something that was completely new to me 
and I thought Id offer it for comment

To keep this as brief as possible let me state my 
observation as a declarative statement and then whoever 
wants to can comment on it  Basically what I think 
Ive observed is that the phrase the Ten Commandments 
as used by Moses is not a reference to Ex 20117 but 
rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex 
201 through Ex 3118  That is the phrase the Ten 
Commandments should more accurately be translated the 
Ten Discourses of which the passage we call the Ten 
Commandments is really only the first

Im not completely convinced that the above is true but 
for purposes of discussion let me argue it as though I 
was sure

Arguments supporting the above idea

1  There arent really ten commandments in Ex 20117  
In order to get 10 commandments you have to get two of 
them out of verses 36 and the verses themselves do not 
support such a division because they are all about not 
worshipping other gods  That is verse 3 commands to 
have no other gods and verse 5 commands to not worship 
the idols mentioned in verse 4  You cant violate 
verses 56 without violating verse 3 indicating that 
the whole passage is one command and leaving us with 
only Nine Commandments  I could go on at length about 
this but for now Ill just stop with this summary

2  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 201 the beginning
of the traditional Ten Commandments and Ex 3118 
where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the 
Ten CommandmentsDiscourses written on them  I break 
these ten down as follows 20117 202226 2112333 
2513010 301116 301721 302233 303438 
31111 and 311218  In most cases each of these 
passages begins with some variation of the phrase And 
the LORD spoke to Moses saying  The exception is 
Ex 211 which begins Now these are the ordinances 
which you are to set before them

3  The word translated commandments in the phrase 
the Ten Commandments isnt really the word for 
commandment its the word for a speech or an 
utterance  Its a word often used for longer discourses 
rather than individual statements for instance when 
combined with the word yom day this word is 
translated Chronicles in such phrases as now the rest 
of the acts of soandso are they not written in the 
Chronicles of x  The word for commandment is 
freely used throughout the books of Moses and perhaps 
it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten Xs 
he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and 
chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer 
than just a single command

4  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the 
stone tablets with the law and the commandments Ex 
2412 yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He 
has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai  If the 
Ten Commandments were only Ex 20117 it is not 
immediately clear why God would wait several days and 
nine more discourses before giving these tablets to 
Moses  On the other hand if we have the Ten Discourses 
written on the tablets then it makes perfect sense that 
God would not give Moses the tablets until He had 
finished delivering all Ten Discourses

5  When Moses did get the tablets he found that both 
tablets were written on both sides Ex 3215  If 
these Ten Commandments were only the first 17 verses 
of Ex 20 God would have had to have written in LARGE 
letters  Not that He couldnt have of course but it 
does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to 
two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal
sized letters

6  In II Cor 3 Paul seems to specifically single out 
the commandments written on stone as being the 
ministry of death that which is fading away and 
the ministry of condemnation  With the possible 
exception of the commandment about the Sabbath it is 
difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in 
Ex 20117 as being temporary fading awaytype 
commandments  This is less of a problem if the stone 
tablets should happen to have included all of the 
commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31

Arguments against this idea

The main argument against this idea aside from the fact 
that it contradicts a longstanding tradition is that 
in Dt 522 Moses says after quoting the commands in 
Ex 20117 These words the LORD spokeand He added 
no more  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and 
gave them to me  This appears to identify the words 
just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone 
tablets

That was my first impression anyway  However after 
some thought I noted that a great deal hinges on how 
you understand the phrase These words  If Moses meant 
These words which I have just related to you were 
spoken by God etc then that would mean that only the 
traditional Ten Commandments were on the stone 
tablets  If however Moses was making a parenthetical 
commentThese words which I AM NOW telling you were 
spoken by God etcthen thats quite different

I did note that in the Dt 5 account Moses tells of 
being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the 
people asking Moses to represent them before God 
whereas in the Exodus account the people asked this of 
Moses between the first and second discourses several 
days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets  This 
reinforces the idea that Moses remarks in Dt 522ff 
were intended as a parenthetical remark rather than a 
strictly chronological account of when God wrote what 
and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the 
tablets

Summary  all things considered I find it somewhat more 
likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only 
the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses 
of God  I dont know if anybody has ever espoused this 
idea before its brandnew to me  So while I lean 
towards accepting it I would be very interested in 
hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to 
offer
