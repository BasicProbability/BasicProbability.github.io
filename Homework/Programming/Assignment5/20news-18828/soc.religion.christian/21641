Subject Re Mormon Temples

In article 28334athosrutgersedu dhammerspacific David Hammerslag writes

 This paragraph brought to mind a question  How do you Mormons reconcile
 the idea of eternal marriage with Christs statement that in the ressurection
 people will neither marry nor be given in marriage Luke chapt 20

Thats the whole point David  As spirits separated from their bodies
and living in the spirit world they cannot undergo the ordinance of
marriage just as they cannot be baptized since there is no physical
body to be baptized  We perform these ordinances as proxies for them
in their behalf  Thanks for asking  Brooks
