Subject Homosexuality

Recently an email to me mentioned

Technically the messengers arent even human so
it cant be a case of homosexuality  even of rape 

The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of
the Sodomites lust for the other flesh of angels  Again
application to homosexual behavior in general or to the position of
gay Christians is largeely specious

Are angels flesh No I feel that this is saying that it was because
of their lust after other men who are flesh or of this world

what are other opinons on this I havent heard much about this verse  
at all

In Christs Love
