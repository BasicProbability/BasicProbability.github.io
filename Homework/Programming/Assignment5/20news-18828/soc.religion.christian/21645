Subject Re hate the sin

Interesting point  The Bible doesnt say hate the sin
It tells to avoid sin resist sin even when necessary denounce sin
But not hate

The following passages all talk about God or people God approves of
hating sin or some other action  Ps 119113 also talks about hating
the sinner  I believe there are other passages that would talk about
hating someone who is evil but I didnt turn them up in this search
which was on the word hate in the KJV though Ive crosschecked
each passage in the NRSV

Ps 9710 1013 10525 119104 113 128 163  1392122
Prov 616 813
Isa 618
Amos 515
Zec 817
Rev 26
