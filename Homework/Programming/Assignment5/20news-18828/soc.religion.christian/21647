                       CHRISTIANITY IN CRISIS
                                    by Hank Hanegraaff



         Controversy for the sake of controversy is a sin
            Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command
                                       Dr Walter Martin


Dr Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him
as President of the Christian Research Institute  the largest 
evangelical countercult organization in the world In this skillful 
careful treatment of an explosive subject Hanegraaff documents and 
examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly 
compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian 
faith For the first time ever this large and influential movement
is legitimately labeled as cultic

In this book Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith 
movement as EW Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of another gospel 
Gal 169 Kenneth E Hagin Kenneth Copeland Benny Hinn Frederick
KC Price John Avanzini Robert Tilton Marilyn Hickey Paul David 
Yonggi Cho Charles Capps Jerry Savelle Morris Cerullo and Paul and 
Jan Crouch
