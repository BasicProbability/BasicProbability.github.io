Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin Ill leave it unnamed
since I dont want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner

Though you can certaily assert all this I dont see why it necessarily
has to be the case Why cant hate just stay as it is and not beget more
Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner I admit
this happens but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so

Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred

In the summary of the law Christ commands us to love God and to love our 
neighbors He doesnt say anything about hate In fact if anything he 
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves So how are Christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others I suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin either in others or ourselvesthrough prayer We

Certainly we should love even our enemies Amos 515 says to hate the evil
and love the good This cant contradict Christs teaching I think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude when it really should be
considered more objectively Surely I dont fly into a rage at every sin
I see but why can I not hate it
