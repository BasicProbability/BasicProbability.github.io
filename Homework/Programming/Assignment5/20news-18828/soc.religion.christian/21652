Hi Frank

Ive read it a couple of times and I think that it is excellent
Christiandom has needed this book for some time now I suggest that
every Christian read it

According to Hank they printed 15 times more than Harvest House
usually prints for the first printing and it still sold out in
the first week It is in its second printing and most Christian
book stores have waiting lists You can order it directly from CRI
