Hate the sin but love the sinnerIve heard that quite a bit recently 
often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality
but the context really isnt that important My question is whether that
statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not

Hate begets more hate never love Consider some sin Ill leave it unnamed
since I dont want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not 
something is a sin Now lets apply our hate the sin philosophy and see
what happens If we truly hate the sin then the more we see it the 
stronger our hatred of it will become Eventually this hate becomes so 
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner In addition our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and 
do things which are taken personally by the sinner who often does not even 
believe what they are doing is a sin After enough of this the sinner begins
to hate us they certainly dont love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior Hate builds up and drives people away from Godthis certainly
cannot be a good way to build love

I dont agree but I can only speak for myself  I have a good friend
whose lifestyle is very sinful  Do I hate the things she does to herself
and others  Yes  Do I hate her  Absolutely not  In fact she tells me
repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world  I care about
her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life

Its very easy to fall into the progression you describe above  Ive
felt it with my friend more than once  There is a very important 
part of Christianity that youve overlooked above and makes it possible
to love the sin but hate the sinner  Before I look at someone
elses life and sin I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see
in me as I see in others probably more  Selfrighteousness is
contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you
describe happen  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say Wretched
man that I am Romans 724 NASB that Christian will be able
to love the sinner and hate the sin  If we have the attitude of the Pharisee 
who said I thank Thee that I am not like other men Luke 1811 NASB
we will hate both
