	Often times most recently on this list in the last few days Ive
heard the passage from revelation

	whoever adds to the sacred words of this bookwhoever removes
	 words from this book    

	 I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons

 2 good reasons deleted  AI

	If one takes the translation of this book in REV 1822 or somewhere
	around there to mean all of scripture then all of us are likely
	holding something that is in violation of this command

Its even worse than that 

Ye shall not add unto the word which I 
command you neither shall ye diminish 
from it Deut 42
Shall we rip out every page from our 
Bibles beginning from Joshua through
Revelation
