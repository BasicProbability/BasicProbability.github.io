Subject How to dispose of old blessed palms

What is the proper way to dispose of old blessed palms
Ive have a bunch that Ive been holding onto  In addition
my mom has been giving me hers  I used to give them to my
uncle who would burn them and leave the ashes to seep into the
ground  Should I do the same  Could I just bury them  Could
I add them to my compost bin

Thanks in advance

tony
