               SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

DS Bailey

     DS Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning
of arsenokoitai  He takes the term in I Cor 69 as denoting males who actively
engage in homosexual acts in contrast to malakoi effeminate those who
engage passively in such acts4   However he insists that Paul knew nothing
of inversion as an inherited trait or an inherent condition due to
psychological or glandular causes and consequently regards all homosexual
practice as evidence of perversion 38  Hence Bailey limits the terms
reference in Pauls works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the
term as homosexuals  Bailey wants to distinguish between the homosexual
condition which is morally neutral and homosexual practices italics in
source  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatts translation
sodomites best represents Pauls meaning in Baileys judgment 39  Bailey
clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers

J Boswell

     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is
that of John Boswell5    Whereas the usual translation6  of this term gives
it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense Boswell gives it a passive
sense

      In an extended discussion of the term 34153 he cites linguistic
evidence and common sense to support his conclusion that the word means male
sexual agents ie active male prostitutes  His argument is that the arseno
part of the word is adjectival not the object of the koitai which refers to
base sexual activity  Hence the term according to Boswell designates a male
sexual person or male prostitute  He acknowledges however that most
interpret the composite term as active meaning those who sleep with make
their bed with men  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the
historical setting  He argues that in some compounds such as paidomathes
child learner the paido is the subject of manthano and in others such
as paidoporos through which a child passes the paido is neither subject
nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance  His point is
that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning  More
directly he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno employ it
objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno use it as an adjective
343  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno

     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time namely drauci or exoleti 
These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects  The Greek
arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci  the corresponding passive
would be parakoitai one who lies beside Boswell affirms  He claims that
arsenokoitai was the most explicit word available to Paul for a male
prostitute since by Pauls time the Attic words pornos fornicator and
porneuon one committing fornication found also in the LXX had been
adopted to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed
fornication7

     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus Plato
Aristotle and Plutarch and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus
Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that
arsenokoitai did not connote homosexual or even sodomite in the time of
Paul 3468   He also demonstrates its absence in PseudoLucian Sextus
Empiricus and Libanius  He subsequently finds it lacking in all discussions
of homosexual relation 3469  among Christian sources in Greek including
the Didache Tatian Justin Martyr Eusebius10    Clement of Alexandria
Gregory of Nyssa and John Chrysostom  Chrysostom is singled out for his
omission as final proof that the word could not mean homosexuality11 

     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from
discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers 34812   Cited are
Tertullian Arnobius Lactantius and Augustine  The last named uses
circumlocutions  Other Latin writers include Ausonius Cyprian and Minucius
Felix  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation  By the
sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual
activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife
353

     Having surveyed the sources Boswell concludes 

   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted
   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter and every
reason
   to suppose that whatever they came to mean they were not determinative of
   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts 353

It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male
prostitutes  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not
disapprove of gay inclination  gay relationships  enduring love between
persons of the same gender or samesex eroticism  112 16617

6  Several tranlation of I Tim 110 are  KJV them that defile themselves
with mankind  ASV  Abusers of themselves with men  NASB  homosexuals
RSV NKJV NRSV sodomites  NEB NIV perverts GNB sexual perverts In
I COr 69 these occur  KJV abusers of themselves with mankind ASV
Abusers of themselves with men  NASB RSV homosexuals NKJV sodomites
 NEB homosexual persversion  The RSV and NEB derive their translation from
two Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as homosexual
perverts  NRSV has the two words as male prostitutes in the text and
sodomites in the footnote  The active idea predominates among the
commentators as well  it is the primary assumption
7  Boswell Christianity 344  Yet this was no a word available to Paul for a
male prostitute for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul
as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms  If Paul
coined the term it would have no prior history and all such discussion about
its lack of usage in contemporary nonChristian and Christian literature is
meaningless
8  Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word
9  The key phrase here apparently is discussoin for Boswell admits later
350 n42 that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in the
context  Hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer
Polycarp To the Philippian 53 Theophilus Ad Autolycum 12 214Nilus
Epistularum libri quattuor 2282  Cyril of Alexandria Homiliae diversae
14 Sybilline Oravle 213 meant  Yet Polycarp who was a disiple of Hohn
the Apostle and died about AD 155 argues in the context that young men
should be pure  He uses only the three terms pornoi malakoi and arsenokoitai
from Pauls list  This at least makes Boswells use of all subjective 
Apparently Clement of Alexandria Paedogogus 311 Sromata 318 also belong
here

10  Yet Eusebius uses it in Demonstraionis evangelicae 1
11  Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostoms use of
arsenokoitai and its form about 20 in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1
or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when
Chrysostom uses it  Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our
study whether in the lists or other discussions  Boswell later admits 351
that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on
I Cor  Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange it may be that
Paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai  
12  Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here since he renders
arsenokoitai as masculorum concubitores corresponding almost exactly to the
Greek 348 n36
