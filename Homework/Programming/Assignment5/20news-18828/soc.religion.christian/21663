Subject Christianity and holy things

Ezek 2226 God seems to be upset with the priests who have made no
difference between the holy and the profane  This brought to my mind a
sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said Gods second name does
not begin with a D referring I believe to use of Gods holy name and
titles as swear words  I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at
the burning bush when God told him Take off your sandals for the place
where you are standing is holy ground

These and other texts seem to imply that Gods people must treat holy
things differently from other common things or make a difference
between holy and common things

The obvious questions are 

What makes something holy and How are Christians primarily supposed to
make this difference between holy and common things  eg Gods name
the Holy Spirit the Holy Bible etc
