Subject Re Satan kicked out of heaven Biblical

Someone asked about Biblical support for the image of Satan as
a fallen angel  Rev 1279 and Enoch have been cited  clh

There is also a verse in Luke that says HeJesus saw Satan fall
from Heaven  Its something like that  I dont have my Bible in
front of me or I would quote it directly but its a pretty obvious
reference to Satans expulsion

Justin

I believe the reference is to Luke 1018  The context of the passage
makes it possible that Jesus is referring to Satan being defeated by
Jesus mission rather than a previous fall from heaven  clh
