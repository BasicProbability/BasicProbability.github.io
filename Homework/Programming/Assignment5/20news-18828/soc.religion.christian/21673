Subject Verse divisions

Im wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which
Ive been thinking about What was the process used to divide the Bible into
verses I believe Jerome divided the New Testament but Ive never seen any
discussion of how he did this It seems rather arbitrary as opposed to for
example making each sentence a verse
