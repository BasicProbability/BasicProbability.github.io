Subject eros in LXX concluding lexicographic note

This might be better directed to srcbiblestudy which I have begun
reading but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum I will
conclude here as well  A week ago I managed to find time to consult
a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library
and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as
used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the
Jewish scriptures

The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal
noun from erao erastes meaning lover  This cluster occurs just
where one might most expect it in the propethic image and accusation
of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH  The verses in question are Hosea
257  10 Jeremiah 430 2220  22 Lamentations 119 and Ezekiel
1633 36 37 and 235 9  22

	 Hosea seems to have originated this usage which Jeremiah and
	  Ezekiel picked up  Lamentations is dependent on though not
	  likely written by Jeremiah 

The erotic meaning in its allegorical use not at all literally is
evident  So too in English unless you complement it with a phrase like
of the arts the word lover is going to have an overtone of sexual
relationship  There is no surprise here but it is worthwhile to see
that standard Greek usage does show up in the translations from the
Hebrew 

More interestingly and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine
usage avoided the verb erao because of its homonymy to ero say
eromai ask there is an error in Codex Vaticanus normally a very
valuable witness where a form of erao is used in a completely absurd
context  2 Samuel 2018 where the  meaning must be say

In addition to the above and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs
Esther 217 uses the verb in its most natural application 

	kai erasthe ho basileus Esther    and the King loved Esther

and rather more interestingly 1 Samuel 192 supplies a modest degree of
support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan

	kai Ionathan huios Saoul eireito ton Dauid sphodra
	 and Jonathan Sauls son loved David intensely

	 Im using the bracketed i for iota subscript which I
	  dont yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for 

The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about
the historical facts but just that a quasiofficial translation of
the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the
erotic verb in this context  Given the quite general usage of agapao
for erotic senses this need not mean anything more than agapao alone
would mean but it DOES disambiguate the relationship as far as this
translator goes
