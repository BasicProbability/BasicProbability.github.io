      I believe with everything in my heart that on May 3 1993 the city of
 Portland Oregon in the country of the United States of America will be hit
 with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake
 By now we know that this did not come to pass

Surprise surprise I sure didnt lose any sleep over it and I live there

Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous  For me my greatest fears
in this area would be the following
4were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent Gods Word
   my calling would be lost forever  Gods Word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet  My
   bridges would be burnt forever  Perhaps I could repent and be saved but
   I could never again be a prophet of God

Suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death
in glory and power flying in the clouds with the host of heavensoon within
the lifetimes of those then standing with him  and 2000 years went by without
any such event He also asserted so they say himself to be God

2 questions

	1 Is that one of those false prophecies you were talking about
	2 Does that make the speaker a false prophet

Speak directly  If the Lord has given you something to say say it
But before I declare thus sayeth the Lord Id better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain again without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers

Uhh  Has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these
things for certain without the tiniest shadow of a doubt That people
who thought they did have also been deluded

Those of us who believe in actually being able to CHECK our opinions
have an out  we can check against some external reality Those who
assert that beliefs entertained without evidence or even despite evidence
have a special virtue ie faith are out of luck  and this is the
result

Its time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood  When we say thus sayeth the
Lord it happens  When we pray prayer is answered because we prayed right
When we say were christians we really mean it

           Dan

You want to demonstrate Christian honesty Great
Start with the prophecy above  what can we conclude about the speaker
