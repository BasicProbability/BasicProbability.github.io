Subject Re homosexuality

I am going to stop reading the homosexuality posts at least for a  
while because of the repeated seemingly personal attacks on me via  
postemailmainly email  If anyone has a specific comment  
suggestion andor note that does not contain any name calling etc  
that they would like for me to read send it to me via email  I  
would like a copy of file mentioned by the moderator ragarding the  
exergetical issue of it  I attempted to get it via ftp but was  
unable
