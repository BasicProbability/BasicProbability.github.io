Indeed LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their childrens sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly cf DC 682528

Hi Bruce  How do you reconcile this practice with Ezekiel 18
Ezekiel 1820 The soul who sins is the one who will die  The son will not
share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the
son  The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him

Actually in DC 682528 the parents are being held accountable for
their own sins  Specifically they are accountable for their failure
to teach their children properly  If I fail to teach my children
that stealing is wrong then I am responsible for their theft if they
later indulge in such behavior

This is very similar to the instructions Ezekiel was given in
Eze 318  If Ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked 
not only would the wicked die in his sins but the Lord would hold
Ezekiel responsible  Similarly parents are responsible to teach
their children right from wrong  I suspect most Christians and
Jews etc would agree that parents have this responsibility
