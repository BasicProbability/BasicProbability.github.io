 Of course the whole issue is one of discernment  It may be that Satan
 is trying to convince us that we know more than God  Or it may be that
 God is trying as God did with Peter to teach us something we dont
 know that God shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears
 him and does what is right is acceptable to him Acts 103435

Fine but one of the points of this entire discussion is that we
conservative reformed christians  this could start an argument
But isnt this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly new this
century  Is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint
before this century I dont know dont believe that homosexuality
is acceptable to Him So your scripture quotation doesnt work for
us
