Subject Re homosexual issues in Christianity

Michael  Michael Siemon mlspanixcom writes

Michael The kind of interpretation I see as incredibly perverse is
Michael that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket
Michael equation of homosexual behavior and rape  Since Christians
Michael citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have
Michael at least READ the story it amounts to slander  a charge
Michael that homosexuality  rape  to use that against us

and

Michael  It is just
Michael as wrong though slightly less incendiary so its a
Michael secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate
Michael homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the
Michael rape of Gods messengers

Lets review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly  It states
clearly that the visitors were angels  But all the men from every
part of the city of Sodomboth young and oldsurrounded the
house  They called to Lot Where are the men who came to 
you tonight  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex 
with them  

For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men
of Sodom and by Lot as men  Furthermore we know from Gen 182021
that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sinbefore
the angels visited the city  It is clear that the grievous sin
of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex  It appears that
the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had
group orgies in the public squarewhich simply indicates 
the extremity of their depravity  It does not show that lesser 
degrees of homosexuality are not sinful as Michael would have us
believe

Ultimately our understanding of Gods will for sexuality comes from
the creation storynot solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah  He
created us male and female and instituted marriage as a relationship
between one male and one female Therefore a man will leave his
father and mother and be united with his wife and they will become
one flesh  This marriage relationship is the only sexual
relationship which God blesses and sanctions He regulates and
protects the marriage of man and woman and even uses it as a picture
of the relationship between himself and his church  But we find not
one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between 
two men or between two women

Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from
or expresses Gods will in instituting and blessing marriage  Thus
the Levitical code which was given only to the Jews forbade incest
homosexuality bestiality the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and
the coveting of our neighbors wife other commandments forbade rape
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and
perverse Jude 7 because they abandoned andor polluted the marriage
relationship  Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as unnatural
Romans 12627not because this was simply Pauls opinion
but because it was contrary to Gods purpose in creating us
male and female
  
Michael Christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here
Michael and in every corner of USENET and the world and ALL they
Michael ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously
Michael have never thought about maybe never even read in TOTAL
Michael ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest
Michael charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
Michael manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they
Michael suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss
Michael our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what
Michael it is

Really have you no better response to slander than more
slander
