much deleted 
point today might be the Masons  Just a note that they too worshipped 
Osiris in Egypt
much deleted 

     It bugs me when I see this kind of nonsense

     First there is no reasonable evidence linking Masonry to ancient
Egypt or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century and
theres nothing definitive before the 17th

Im going to cut Rexs ramblings down a bit


You must not be past your 20th level  You should read Wilkinsons
Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British
Masonry  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black
mason  Ive talked with him 
There is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of

   Rex there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree
Masons in this country and thousands of 33rds If nasty stuff was
really going on dont you think youd have more than a couple of
disgruntled members exposing it Heck if what you say is true then
Rev Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper
 

Long quote from someone named Hislop source not given deleted Im
attempting to extract from it the relevent points 

   Osiris is actually Nimrod a Babylonian Deity 

   It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally
    founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis the goddessmother or
    wife of Osiris

   The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building
    trade ie with Masonry

   Nimrod as the son of Cush was a negro isnt this refering to a 
    Biblical Nimrod rather than the Babylonian god

    there was a tradition in Egypt recorded by Plutarch that Osiris
     was black


     There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage
for the order on the flimsiest of grounds This dates right back to
the Constitutions of 1738 which cite Adam as the first Mason Ive
seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans Greeks and
Egyptians and Atlanteans I even have a book which claims to prove
that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple 

    Claims prove nothing Wheres the beef Rex

Claims exMason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge
 Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard

   Id have to check this The tomb paintings I remember dont show
this

  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show or should I say
 hide this representation  They however worshipped the spotted cow

   Can you give ancient citations for this The druids were suppressed
over 2000 years ago Whats your point

   This whole leopard skin business sounds bizarre  I have not yet
gone through the Scottish Rite which contains all of those higher
degrees antiMasons get so excited about and which was invented in
the 1750s but I know enough people who have and who are good
Christians that I reject your claim

Ill stand by my statements  Masonry is of the mystery religions
that all find their source in Babylon the great harlot Sorry Peter
I do not mean to be a cold slap to the face but there is to much

Not so much a slap in the face as a weary feeling of deja vu Im
going through a very similar argument over on soccultureafricanamerican

evidence to the contrary that Masonry doesnt find its origins in
Egypt  Of the Masons I have personally talked to all refered to
Egypt as their origin  

    Why dont you try reading some serious books on Masonic history such
as Hamills The Craft

Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago
was freely admitted

   Because we got honest If you can come up with actual evidence that
Masonry existed prior to 1390 Id be VERY impressed actually
anything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good
