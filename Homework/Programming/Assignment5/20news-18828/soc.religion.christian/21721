 Anyone who thinks being gay and Christianity are not compatible should 
 check out Dignity Integrity More Light Presbyterian churches Affirmation
 MCC churches etc  Meet some gay Christians find out who they are pray
 with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion
 
 If you were to start your own religion this would be fine  But there
 is no scriptural basis for your statement   

How about Acts 11 1518 2223
or I John 418
which says to try the spirits to see if they be of God  

 in fact it really gets to the heart of the problem
 You think you know more than scripture
 Your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the Word of God  

How do you know  When have you tried to learn anything about me
