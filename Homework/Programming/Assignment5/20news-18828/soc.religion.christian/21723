Subject Re What WAS the immaculate conception

In article May14021119199325177athosrutgersedu seannabnrca Seanna SM Watson wrote
I have quite a problem with the idea that Mary never committed a sin
Was Mary fully human  If it is possible for God to miraculously make 
a person free of original sin and free of committing sin their whole
life then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus  Why cant
God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us
sinless without the need for repentance and salvation and all that

   Yes Mary is fully human  However that does not imply that she was
just as subject to sin as we are  Catholic doctrine says that mans
nature is good Gen 131 but is damaged by Original Sin Rom 51216
In that case being undamaged by Original Sin Mary is more fully human
than any of the rest of us

   You ask why God cannot repeat the miracle of Marys preservation
from Original Sin  A better way to phrase it would be why did He
not do it that way but you misunderstand how Marys salvation was
obtained  Like ours the Blessed Virgin Marys salvation was obtained
through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross  However as
God is not bound by time which is His creation God is free to apply
His Sacrifice to anyone at any time even if that person lived before
Christ came to Earth from our timebound perspective  Therefore
Christs Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose and
were necessary even for Marys salvation
