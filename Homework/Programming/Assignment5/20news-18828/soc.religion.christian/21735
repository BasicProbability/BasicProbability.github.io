Subject Re Marys assumption

DavidBernardcentralsuncom Dave Bernard writes

When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

I dont see how this logically follows  True enough Mary received a blessing
beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be 
the mother of the Savior  It says nothing about Mary needing to be a blessed 
person first in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of 
God  Again I think the problem is that as humans we cant comprehend how the 
sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and Gods Spirit
Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God we must needs try
to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be  Marys own
words 

my spirit rejoices in God my Savior for he has regarded the low
 estate of his handmaiden

sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity in need of a 
Savior similar to what David proclaimed in his psalmsnot the words
of a holy being with no further need for Gods grace

I really apologize for harping on this I dont suppose its important
Its just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid
serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose
to come down to you and I to be born of people like you and I to share
our existence and redeem us from its fallenness by his holy Incarnation
