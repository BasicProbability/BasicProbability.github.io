Jesus Only and Oneness tend to refer to groups that do deny the
trinity    
They explain Matthew by saying that Jesus is the name of the Father Jesus
is the name of the Son and Jesus is the name of the name of the Holy
Spirit Father Son  Holy Spirit referring to different roles all
filled by Jesus 
 
IMHO this are going from bad to worse 3in1 1in3 was bad enough
 
I do not like a God who prays to Himself  I refuse to believe Jesus prayed
to Himself     lets get real if the scriptures say He prayed to the
Father then the Father IS someone different than the Son  I have no
problems with multiple Gods  To me the whole context of the scriptures
says  Be perfect even as your Father Who is in Heaven that we can be
coheirs with Christ that we will be like Him
 
Coheirs share all things equallyincluding knowledge power dominion etc
When I am like Him Christ I will be the same as HE isand He is a God
 
If God cannot do this the His is not all powerfuland He is NOT God
If He will not He is a Liarand He is NOT God
 
But if He does He is the greatest of all the Gods
 

I dont know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself  The
whole point of the Trinity is that theres enough of a distinction
within God that relationship is possible  This implies some sort of
communication  I assume that in their native form the Father and
Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isnt
involved  But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son ie  the Logos
made flesh  When hes in a human form his human actions are limited
to human capabilities  So communication with the Father takes the
form of prayer  I dont see that theres anything problematical about
that  It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation
