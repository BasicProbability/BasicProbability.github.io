 Early in Church history the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration 
 of the Eucharist  It WAS secret giving rise to the rumors that Christians

I have no problem with the idea that catechumens be dismissed before
the Eucharist  They were not considered qualified to participate

 were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims  The actions were considered
 too holy to be observed by nonChristians as well as potentially dangerous
 for the individual Christian who might be identified

Does the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist was a
secret  I mean was it

	you dont have to stay from now on only the membership can
	participate you really dont have to hang around yes I know
	youre obliged to keep up attendance to qualify but now is an
	exception okay

or was it

	you may not stay what happens next is secret

When we have had reason to conduct business meetings after church
weve made it clear that only members can vote  But weve always been
happy for nonmembers to stay and observe

Do you have evidence for intentional secrecy  Other than rumours
which will always happen when you have an underclass doing things not
approved of by those in power
