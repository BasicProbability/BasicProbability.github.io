Subject Re Marys assumption

When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

I remember a couple of times when my exgirlfriend said that she thought she
was blessed because of her son whom she loved dearly In fact Ive heard
people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times Its a common
figure of speech Considering that Elizabeth was just another human I think
this passage offers nothing towards justifying the blessedness of Mary
