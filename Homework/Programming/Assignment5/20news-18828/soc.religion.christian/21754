R Scroggs

     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and
suggested a new twist to the word  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a
Hellenistic Jewish coinage perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic
terminology  The term is derived from Lev 1822  2013 where the LXX
juxtaposes the two words arsenos male and koiten bed and represents
the Hebrew miskab zabar lying with a male   Yet he believes that Paul did
not originate the term but borrowed it from circles of Hellenistic Jews
acquainted with rabbinic discussions 180 n14  It was invented to avoid
contact with the usual Greek terminology 108  If this is true Scroggs
observes it explains why the word does not appear in GrecoRoman discussions
of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it  It was meaningless to
nativespeaking Greeks 108

     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the
object of the second part thus differing from Boswells learned discussion
107  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of one who lies with a
male to have a very narrow reference  With the preceding malokoi I Cor 69
which Scroggs interprets as the effeminate callboy arsenokoitai is the
active partner who keeps the malakos of the mistress or who hires him on
occasion to satisfy his sexual desires 108  Hence arsenokoitai does not
refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic
model of pederasty  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model he
affirms 109
     This is Scroggs interpretation of the term in I Tim 110 also  The
combination of pornoi fornicators arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave
dealers refers to male prostitutes males who lie with them and slave
dealers who procure them 120  It again refers to that  specific form of
pederasty which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual
purposes and the use of these boys by adult males 121  Even serious
minded pagan authors condemned this form of pederasty  He then uses these
instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently
general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1 
Consequently Paul Must have had could only have had pederasty in mind 122
We cannot know what Paul would have said about the contemporary model of
adultadult mutuality in same sex relation ships 122

     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical
concerns Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of
vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate intended meaning in Paul  The form and
function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped  Any
relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually
nonexistent  He concludes that Paul does not care about any specific item in
the lists 104 

     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary
phenomenon of a catalogue of vices  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are
irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today 129  The model
in todays Christian homosexual community is so different from the model
attacked by the NT that Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not
relevant to todays debate  They should no longer be used in denominational
discussions about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify
refusal of ordination    127

      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI

D Wright

     In more recent years the positions of Bailey Boswell and Scroggs have
come under closer scrutiny   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswells
view is that by David Wright  In his thorough article Wright points out
several shortcomings of Boswells treatment of arsenokoitai   He faults
Boswell for failing to cite or citing inaccurately all the references to Lev
1822 and 2013 in the church fathers such as Eusebius the Apostolic
Constitutions  Clement of Alexandria Tertullian and Origen 12728 
Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term
derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages 129  This
is significant for if the term is so derived it clearly refutes Boswells
claim that the first half of the word arseno denotes not the object but the
gender of the second half koitai  The LXX must mean a male who sleeps with
a male making arseno the object

     Wright also faults Boswells claims regarding linguistic features of the
term including suggested parallels 129  Though Boswell claims that
compounds with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it
as an adjective Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely
one of dialectical diversity No semantic import attaches to the difference
between the two forms 131  Wright believes that in most compounds in which
the second half is a verb or has a verbal force the first half denotes its
object and where the second part is substantival the first half denotes its
gender 132 

     It is with Boswells treatment of the early church fathers that Wright
takes special issue because the former has failed to cite all the sources 
For example Aristides Apology c AD 138 probably uses arrenomaneis
androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male
homosexuality 133 contrary to Boswells discussion  Boswell fails to cite
Hippolytus Refut Omn Haer 5262223 and improperly cites Eusebius and the
Syriac writer Bardensanes  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to
the Syriac of I Cor 69 and I Tim 110 13334 

     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in
parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers the
dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks 134  Sometimes this
parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia adultery porneia
fornication and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris
136  Clement of Alexandria in Protr 101085 cites the second table of the
Ten Commandments as You shall not kill ou moicheuseis you shall not commit
adultery ou paidophthoreseis you shall not practice homosexuality with
boys you shall not steal   150 n 43

     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein commit homosexuality exists in the
Sibylline Oracles 27173  It may be Wright observes that the word was
coined by a Jewish preChristian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by
OrSib book 2 13738

     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius 6th c who drew
upon the first century AD writer Teucer in Macarius 4th5th c and in John
the Faster d 595 13940  The last in particular bears the idea of
homosexual intercourse contrary to Boswell

     Wright next replies to Boswells contention that the term would not be
absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted
14041  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to
the first century AD since it did not exist before then that the Greeks used
dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality that some sources eg
Didache show no acquaintance with Pauls letters or deliberately avoid citing
Scripture and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers 14041 

     Boswells treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wrights attention
14144  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom
omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue  Chrysostom gives a
long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom
126  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostoms infrequent use of the term  Wright
observes that Boswell has signally failed to demonstrate any us of
arsenokoites etc in which it patently does not denote male homosexual
activity 144  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature
and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly
specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the GrecoRoman world 

     Wright also surveys the Latin Syriac and Coptic translations of I Tim
and I Cor  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning
homosexual ie they understand arseno as the object of the second half of
the word 14445  None of these primary versions supports Boswells limited
conclusion based on them

     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the
catalogues of vices as a literary form  He believes that such lists developed
in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of
homosexuality in the Greek world  This paralleled the increased concern on the
part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence  The term came into
being under the influence of the LXX 145 so that writers spoke generally of
male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual
engagement with paides 146  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were
interchangeable it is because the former encompassed the latter 146

     In summary Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning
homosexuality and arises with Judaism   The views of Boswell Scroggs and
others who limit the term to active male prostitutes or pederasty are without
significant support from linguistic and historical studies  

Next the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson  After that we
get into the good stuff of historical  linguistic studies  THis will
include Symposium by Plato  If there is any doubt as to the modern
understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of
Paul this will certainly clear things up  Also we will review Pauls use of
Lev1820 in the NT and how as for him 1 the Law was fulfilled but not done
away with 2 Lev 1820 was the universal and the following chapters the
general  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our
culture should stick around for this one

Independently we came to the same conclusion  Apparently the connection is
made in EA Sophocles Greek Lexicon of the Roman  Byzantine Periods from
146BC to AD 1100
14   See discussion 1014  He says the same thing about Pauls language in
Rom 12627 128  But this is doubtful  See the more cautious words of P
Zaas I Cor 69ff Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church SBLASP
17 197920512  He observes that the words moixai malakoi and arsenokoitai
were part of Jewish antiGentile polemic  Yet Pauls wors at the end of the
vice list and such were some of you indicate that Paul is addressing real
or potential abuses of his ethical message not citing primitive tradition by
rote 210  Wright disputes Zaas attempt to associate the term with idolatry

15  On Boswells treatment of Rom 1267 the article by RB Hays Relations

17  In an unpublished paper Henry Mendell ARSENOKOITAI Boswell on Paul
effectively refutres Boswells claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai 
He finds the meaning to be general a male who has sex with a male 411  
18  Wrights endnotes 14849 list additional sources in the church fathers
19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the
references to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha  See  JB
DeYoung A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and
Pseudepigrapha BSac 146588 199043753
20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai
points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance Wright asks pertinently
why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria nor Josephus paiderastia
and why   Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former  152 n
71  In a more recent article Homosexuality The Relevance of the Bible EvQ
61 1989291300 Wright reiterates these same points  Paul shows a
remarkable originality in extending the OT ethic to the church 300
