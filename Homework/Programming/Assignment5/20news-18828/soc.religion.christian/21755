Subject Re Marys assumption

DavidBernardcentralsuncom Dave Bernard writes

I also dont see the necessity of saying the Holy Parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of Gods grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being  


When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond 


Whoa dude I dont see the jump you made
		She was blessed Ill give you that much
		What do you mean she was placed beyond 





the sanctification of normal humanity
