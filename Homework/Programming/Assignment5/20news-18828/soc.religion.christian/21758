Subject Mary blessed among women

Dave Bernard writes

  When Elizabeth greeted Mary with the words Blessed art thou
  among women Luke 142 it appears that this places Mary
  beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

But Deborah says Judges 524

  Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
  Blessed above all women in the tents

It can doubtless be taken that Jaels slaying of Sisera was a type
of Marys victory over sin But even if we take Deborahs words as
applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary they must still be
applicable literally to Jael  We may well take them to mean that
God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His
people and that she has this in common with Mary  But we have no
reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless and thus no
reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she
was sinless
