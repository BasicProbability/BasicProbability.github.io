  I suppose thats true if you maintain that AK47s and AR15s are hunting
  weapons  I think they are fun to plink canstargetsrandom VC with
  but not suitable for real hunting  
  
   Wrong Both are legal to hunt with here in Kentucky I have a picture of
   a friend with a nice 8point buck which he shot with his AR15 rifle
 
 I dont think many deer hunters would condone your friends choice of
 rifle 
 
 I must agree with Nathan As a deer hunter I find it inhumane to use
 underpowered weapons for deer hunting To kill cleanly with the little
 223 requires extremely good marksmanship Most hunting situations dont
 allow for perfect shots Hunters should use sufficiently powerful
 weapons to drop the deer with a single hit to the chest The 762x39
 from the AKS47 or SKS is adequate to this task having similar ballistics
 to the familiar 3030 but the little 223 is very marginal In the
 hands of the expert or the lucky it will do but hunters really
 should have more respect for their quarry

 Ill agree that the popular 55 gr loading for 223 rem  is too small for
 deersized game  However if you use a 70 gr semispritzer or the Sierra
 63 gr semipointed bullet this would be suitable like any round
 you keep your shots within a reasonable range  It would still be on the
 lower end of what Id consider acceptable performance especially those
 long distance shots out West hunting Monster Mule Deer  The 223 rem has
 been declared legal for deer hunting in Oklahoma
 
 The 223 is excellent for varmit hunting and pest control  The AR15 in
 particular is well suited given its heavy barrel and heat shielded foregrip
 Add a highpower scope and youre in Dog heaven
 
 However I dont think Nathan Janette was refering to the specific chambering
 of the rifle in question  Maybe he thinks self loading rifles have no
 place in deer hunting  That may or may not be his opinion but many
 sportsmen do use self loading rifles and shotguns

Wrongo NRA man  I was definitely referring to the round not the
autoloading aspect of the rifle  I have no problem with responsible
hunting  That doesnt include machine guns from choppers but a semi is
fine  My uncle has bagged several deer with 12 gauge slugs  I would prefer
that a hunter use as much of the catch as possible and I dont condone
hunting for sport only 

IMHO of course  

Two questions

1  You asserted that both the AR15 and AK47 are not suitable for
   real hunting  If you have no problem with hunting or using
   self loading rifles for hunting why did you say this  If not
   for deer then what about other smaller game

2  When did I get the nickname NRA man  Notice I have never referred
   to you as Janette which you dont seem to like  Do I get any
   superpowers like Spider Man or Powdered Toast Man
