 On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend the lawyers for the
 family of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles Sheriffs
 Department had an assessment done of the ranchers property before
 the raid

The briefing documents for the raid had a notation on them about a
similar local property which had sold for 800000 prior to the
raid if recent TV coverage can be believed

 This strongly implies that the sheriffs department wanted the property
 any drugs which were not found were only an excuse

The Ventura County DA came to the same conclusion in the report he
released which lambasted the Sheriffs Office

Too bad the old man was nearly blind and didnt take a few
goosestepping Drug Warriors TM with him
