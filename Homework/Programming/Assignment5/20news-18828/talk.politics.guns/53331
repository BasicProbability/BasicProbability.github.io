	Wrong again but if you want proof turn on your TV and look
for a show starring Chuck Connors  It was called The Rifleman
Time how fast he can fire that old leveraction rifle

Believe it or not I remember seeing an advertisement for someone
selling one of these apparently Winchester produced a bunch of
these commercially to commemorate the television show I believe it was 
being sold as a handgun because of the barrel length and lack of a stock

I might be mistaking the above weapon for the gun used by Steve
McQueen in Wanted Dead or Alive If so sorry Did Winchester
make any commemorative models of the rifle used by Chuck Connors
in the movie Chuck Connors was an NRA member before he died recently

I dont know for sure if Winchester made any commemeratives  If I
recall correctly the rifle itself was a 4440 Model 92 with an
oversized loop lever  I dont think Winchester makes this rifle
any more  Rossi make a Model 92 lookalike in 38 Special and
357 Magnum
