Subject Re ACLU was Re Waco Shootout 

Paul Hager hagerpcsindianaedu writes

The 2nd Amendment does say keep and bear  If bear is defined to
mean carry then most people are physically unable to carry a several
hundred pound nuclear device

As I understand it subkiloton nuclear demolitions are manportable
and carried in a backpack

As I recall in the 60s the Kennedy Administration had subkiloton
nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe and destroyed  They were man
portable and made for use in shouldermount rocket launchers  The
smallest nuclear test Ive seen data for was a 1 yes onetenth
kiloton weapon tested either in the late 40s or early 50s
