 In Viet Nam Lt Calley was tried and convicted of murder because his
 troops in a war setting deliberately killed innocent people It is
time
 that the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere to
 standards at least as moral as the militarys

No Lt Calley was later acquitted His troops killed 400500
people including kids elderly and women I sure dont want
to see the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country
adhere to those military standards If they did were
all in big troubleThe My Lai massacre was covered up
by highranking officials and ALL who were involved were
ACQUITTED
