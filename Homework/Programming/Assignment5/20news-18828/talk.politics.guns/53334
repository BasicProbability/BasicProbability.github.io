 Here is a press release from Handgun Control Inc
 
  Sarah Brady Calls On Governor to Veto NRA Bill Bayh Urged to
 Follow Clintons Lead
  To State Desk
  Contact Cheryl Brolin of Handgun Control Inc 2028980792
 
    WASHINGTON April 2  In a letter today to Indiana Gov 
 Evan Bayh Sarah Brady wife of former White House
 Press Secretary James Brady and chair of Handgun Control Inc
 called on the governor to veto NRAbacked preemption legislation
 SB 241 which would wipe out existing local gun laws and
 prohibit localities from enacting future regulations governing the
 sale possession or transfer of firearms
    Im counting on Gov Bayh to show the same kind of political
 courage President Clinton showed as governor of Arkansas when he
 twice vetoed this type of specialinterest legislation Mrs Brady
 said referring to Clintons veto of NRAbacked preemption bills in
 1989 and 1991
 

I knew that Cutie would sell us out  Fullblooded Democrat he is 

Seriously folks if it can happen here remember  we all got gun racks on
our 4x4s it can happen anywhere  Now to get that letter ready  Dear 
Cutie as one who didnt vote for you I can sincerely say I am unhappy
