Subject Re Waco dates  are these coincidental

I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy
wonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  the
Gun War on the Constitution  Look at what the Bush administration did to
get material for the Drug War on the Constitutionremember that baggie of
crack George waved at the cameras  They took a dealer from the ghetto
and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been
dealt onb the White House Lawn
And I dont think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any
moral qualms about the raid
The only really worrisome thing is that the BDs heroic defense of
their ranch will make Clintons Gun War on the Constitution more
successfullexactly as he wanted  The media and politicians will
filter this so that the general public will think the BDs
are bad guys  Dont help them  Stand up for the BDs with your
friends and family adnd in public anytime you cantheir supposed
moral qualms are not important to the issue  They are heroes in the
fight against oppressive government  it could just as well have been
you
