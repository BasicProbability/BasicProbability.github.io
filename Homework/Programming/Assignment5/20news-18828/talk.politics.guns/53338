Subject Re Gun Control proud to be a Canuck

Does anyone really believe the Swiss have had no war within their borders
because every adult male owns a rifle Im a great admirer of the Swiss but
500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership Can you
picture Hitler with Panzers and FockeWulfs poised on the border losing
sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman Sure 
Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this
world Wed do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more
rifles on the street Lets disband the NRA and start a National Investment
Banking Association replete with red and black sticker for the back window
of Bubbas Mercedes 600 We could fire Charlton Heston and get Paul Volcker
for a spokesman
