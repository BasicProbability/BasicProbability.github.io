Yes I am progun and yes I do disagree with this statement
Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous  Radioactive
decay of plutonium and uranium as well as the tritium in the
weapon tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things
Can you say neutron flux

	Can you say I get more background radiation from living in
Denver or having an office in a limestone building than I do standing
next to a power reactor at full power or standing next to a nuclear
warhead that is armed  Look up shielding in your dictionary  You
dont need six feet of lead to make decent shielding your dead skin
cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles and neutrons
are slowed by mere water  What do you think 75 of you is

  Plus these things have no self
defense purposes  Its kinda hard to justify their use as
a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
lowyield weapons or at worst for industrial target obliteration
translation  cities and population centers

	If the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal
government they are indeed useful weapons to the militia  They
wont be too useful in certain areas but leveling the Pentagon
would be a good thing for said overthrow and its likely one man
carrying a backpack would stand a better chance than one thousand
armed with Colt Peacemakers  Dont let selfdefense become the
only reason you can have a gun and your sole means of justification
Myself I wont overthrow my government until it ceases to be my
legal government but if I need to I want every weapon I can get

	One can just as easily say no rifle larger than a 22 is
needed to kill a human being  They are right  When that human
being is wearing armor and riding in an APC things get a bit
different  I dont see where the weapon is a problem  Its not
Only the manner of use is in contention here

  Not to mention that
for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live
requires some sort of launch vehicle   

	I guess you either dont have an alarm clock or have never
heard the terms timer or martyr either  Dont forget remote
detonation devices  That CB radio in the pickup next to you can
easily transmit ten miles in decent weather  Thats out of the
blast radius of many portable nuclear devices

	Just what is it about radioactive decay that has you worried
