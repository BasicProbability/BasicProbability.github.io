Wasnt she the one making the comment in 88 about George being born with
a silver foot in his mouth  Sounds like another damn politician to me

Aint like the old days in Texas anymore  The politicians may have been
corrupt then but at least theyd take a stand  My apologies to a few
exceptions I can think of  

News now is that the House may already have a twothirds majority so 
her opposition out of her concern for image shes even said this
publicly may not matter

Do people expect the Texans congressmen to act as the NJ Republicans did
