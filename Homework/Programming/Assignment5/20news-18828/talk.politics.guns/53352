   I dont know how anyone can state that gun control could have NO
   effect on homicide rates  There were over 250 accidental handgun
   homicides in America in 1990 most with licensed weapons  More
   American children accidentally shot other children last year 15
   than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain  Source National
   Safety Council  Please no dictionary arguments about RATES vs
   TOTAL NUMBERS okay  Theyre offered for emphasis not comparison
   
 
  Youre a great debater  You chose your sources of information claim them
  to  be superior  Im not aware of using any numbers from the ozone unless  
you consider those I got from you to be such
 
 Ive made no such claim  Please direct my attention towards any
 posting of mine where I claimed superior sources of information
 Its probably because I bothered to post any references at all while
 others seem content to post numbers pulled from the ozone that
 youve confused it with facttwisting  If so I apologize  
 

Yes You state the reference and then YOU claim its a good or fair treatment  

  then take those twisted numbers and twist them further by trying  
 
 Well then heres fair opportunity for you to prove that Ive twisted
 numbers  On what grounds do you contradict those references  Do you have
 any citations any sources of your own that I can take similar
 gratuitous shots at
 

You fail to see the differences between absolute numbers and rates

  to compare absolute numbers between two countries that have major  
population  
  differences the USA and GB and then whine that you are afraid someone  
might  
  attack your process and so claim the numbers are for emphasis not  
  comparison  Emphasis of what
 
 Nitpicking and scolding is a whiney debating style Jim
 

No you just miss the point  By your methods I can prove gun control to be a  
total failure  New Yorks total homocide count with its strict gun control  
is MUCH higher than Rhode Islands with its less strict gun control  FAR  
more folks are killed in New York than Rhode Island  Therefore according to  
Mane Logictm gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than  
Rhode Island  Remember its Nitpicking and a whiney debating style to  
point out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat  
my argument

  Anything else is blowing smoke
 
 You seddit brudda

Now you agree  Wow a breakthrough
