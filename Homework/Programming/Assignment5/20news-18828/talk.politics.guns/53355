Wasnt she the one making the comment in 88 about George being born with
a silver foot in his mouth  Sounds like another damn politician to me

Aint like the old days in Texas anymore  The politicians may have been
corrupt then but at least theyd take a stand  My apologies to a few
exceptions I can think of  

News now is that the House may already have a twothirds majority so 
her opposition out of her concern for image shes even said this
publicly may not matter

Do people expect the Texans congressmen to act as the NJ Republicans did

There is a likely veto proof majority in the house  The Senate
unfortunately is a different story  The LtGov has vowed that the bill will
not be voted on and he has the power to do it  In addition the Senate is a
much smaller and more readily manipulated body

On ther other hand the semiautomatic ban will likely not live as at least
fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it and it is VERY far down in
the bill order in the Senate I believe it will be addressed after the CCW
bill

And I thought my TX Political Science class was a waste of time
