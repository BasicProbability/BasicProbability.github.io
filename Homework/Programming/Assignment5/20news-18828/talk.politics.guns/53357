 Thats all very well and good but I was refering to all
 homocides not just ones involving handguns what is this fixation
 on death by shooting as if it were somehow worse than death
 by stabbing

What relevance are ALL homicides in this debate  What do you think gun
control advocates are saying that if we get rid of all handguns we will
live in a homicidefree world

       The relevance is that if youve got x homicides and reduce
the number of gun homicides in that group but x doesnt decrease
by a significant amount have you made an improvement and is that
improvement worth what youve paid

The issue is guns not baseball bats  Even a simpleton knows that
he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat
certainly of outrunning a batwielding assailant

       If a baseball bat is a tenth as likely to kill a victim as a gun
is that any comfort to that tenth

As for knives see my earlier post  Id much rather face a knife
than a gun thanks 

       Ive faced a knife  And I was damn annoyed I didnt have
a gun  All the statistics in the world didnt change the fact that
he was interested in cutting me

Fortunately the best defense against a knife isnt
another knife  Anyone trained in unarmed selfdefense wont have
much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife
assault which probably means 999 of knife assailants

       Anyone trained in selfdefense 

       Unarmed selfdefense isnt for everyone  Whats more it requires
substantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm
It requires physical proximity and thus a greater threat to the victim
which is a primary problem with stun guns  You have to actually touch
your assailant  Unless youre very good a large stronger assailant
can simply ignore your blows long enough to incapacitate you
