For chrissakes take out your calculator and work out the numbers
Here Ive preformatted them for you to make it easier

			handgun homicidespopulation
			
	Switzerland 	24   6350000
	         UK     8  55670000

 and then tell me again how Switzerland is safer with a more
liberal handgun law than the UK is withoutby RATE or TOTAL NUMBER
Your choice

Please PAY ATTENTION
I and others were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS NOT JUST
HANDGUN HOMICIDES  In terms of how likely are you to be killed
regardless of how its done cause DEAD is DEAD the UK has a
higher homicide rate Period  You are more likely to be killed in the
UK than in Switzerland  If you were to be murdered with a handgun
then yes Switzerland has a higher rate  But to belabor the point
you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK In that sense the
weapon is irrelevant  The UK is more violent period
