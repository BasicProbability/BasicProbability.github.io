What relevance are ALL homicides in this debate  What do you think gun
control advocates are saying that if we get rid of all handguns we will
live in a homicidefree world

They sure make it sound like that


The issue is guns not baseball bats  Even a simpleton knows that
he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat
certainly of outrunning a batwielding assailant


Even a simpleton knows a baseball bat is considered a deadly weapon 
If one cannot run away eg old infirm even middleaged if the
assailant is younger a handgun is the most effective means of
defense You wont even have to fire a shot 98 of the time

As for knives see my earlier post  Id much rather face a knife
than a gun thanks  Fortunately the best defense against a knife isnt
another knife  Anyone trained in unarmed selfdefense wont have
much of a problem disarming a knife assailant untrained in knife
assault which probably means 999 of knife assailants

Any real streetfighter and there are LOTS of them with or without a
knife will kick the living sh out of most people trained in
unarmed self defense  For the majority of people a gun is the most
effective form of self defense
