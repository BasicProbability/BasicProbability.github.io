Swatikas were also common in American Indian markingspainted walls etc  Is
it the Swastika that is bad  

Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote  My grandparents
have a Navajo rug made in the 1920s which they received in trade 
from the weaver while living in Flagstaff Arizona  The decorative motif
consists of 4 large black swastikas one in each corner  Whats more the
color scheme is black white and red  To the casual glance it would
undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind  Yet they owned it
ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power  

As I recall they took it down in the 30s and didnt feel quite right
about putting it back up until the 60s  It still draws comments from 
those who dont know what it is
