 Swatikas were also common in American Indian markingspainted walls etc  Is
 it the Swastika that is bad  
 
 Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote  My grandparents
 have a Navajo rug made in the 1920s which they received in trade 
 from the weaver while living in Flagstaff Arizona  The decorative motif
 consists of 4 large black swastikas one in each corner  Whats more the
 color scheme is black white and red  To the casual glance it would
 undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind  Yet they owned it
 ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power  
 
 As I recall they took it down in the 30s and didnt feel quite right
 about putting it back up until the 60s  It still draws comments from 
 those who dont know what it is

Having lived played and worked on and near the Navajo reservation
for a number of years I can confirm this is an ancient pattern
found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old

Also the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern  they
just stopped selling them after the Nazis preempted the swastika

Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and
counterclockwise swastikas

Ob guns  Its the rare Navaho family that doesnt own a rifle 
They remember being relocated by the US Army and dont intend to
do it again  The Hopi on the other hand have a dislike for
weapons from my experience  Perhaps they just hide them better
from strangers
