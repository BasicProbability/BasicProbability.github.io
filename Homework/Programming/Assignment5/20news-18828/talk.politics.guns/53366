Subject National Crime Survey

      Well I dropped by the library yesterday and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey 19861990 in an effort to examine what
it said about selfdefense with a firearm

      I havent ground through much in the way of numbers yet but a couple
of things jumped out at me  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
weapon used in self defense  1988 1989 and 1990 refer only to weapon
The second is that while assaults rose about 3 from 1986 to 1987 wgun
defenses reported fell by almost 25  Unless theres an explanation for
this Im tempted to mark it as a reporting problem and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time

      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference and
not just a reporting difference  The survey doesnt appear to have
changed significantly between 1986 and 1987
