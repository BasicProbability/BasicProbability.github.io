I would be surprised if there werent contrary studies  I might add that
Sloan and Kellerman was endorsed by the police departments of both Seattle
and Vancouver and is considered by most of the references I have at hand the
most exhaustive study of its kind even by those who take issue with some of
the essays conclusions  SKs statistics speak largely for themselves
without postulate

And I might add vitamin C has been endorsed by a Nobel Laureate as a
panacea for almost everything from the common cold to cancer  

 In order to compare violent crime trends SK compared all
violent crime categories from simple assault through various mechanisms of
homicide  

Wait a minute SK did NOT compare trends  If they did they would
have seen that the advent of Canadas gun law had no effect on
homicides total or handgun  Without a pre vs post comparison one
cannot speculate as to the utility of anything  All they have is a
correlation and correlation DOES NOT prove causality


If your point is that nonwhites commit more handgun crimes than whites
then yours is the dubious assumption  Conventional social theory is that
economic status not color is the primary motivating factor for crime
especially violent crime  Whats your point anyway that white people
are more responsible gun owners  Should we assume that its a coincidence
that there are comparitively fewer white people earning below the poverty
line and living in tenement neighborhoods where most violent crime occurs

Hold it again You dismiss a point about demographics then you ask
about socioeconomic demographics Very slick

    Differences between the two cities in the
    permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable

On the contrary its these differences that are the very basis of the study
the easy availability of legal handguns in Seattle and the much more
difficult restrictedweapons permit required in Vancouver

Once again correlation does not prove causality  Looking at prevs
post data the Canadian gun law had no effect


Not so  Cook measures suicides and assaultive homicides with
firearms against a surveybased estimate of the number of legal and
illegal guns in circulation within a city  

Sir if you were a Canadian and owned a gun before the restrictive
gun laws were passed and decided to hide it rather than turn it in
would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from
someone who calls writes or asks you on the street  That is one
problem with surveys  Nobody will answer an incriminating question
Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to
here


Again your author misses the core issue that Vancouver citizens are
prohibited from purchasing handguns on the basis of selfdefense  They
dont have a choice in the matter

Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns I think not You
are discounting guns purchased beforehand and guns purchased for
purposes other than selfdefense which can also be used for defense


Hmmm sounds like your author might like a bumper sticker that reads Guns
dont kill people black people kill people  Honestly his conjectures
backed up by zero evidence zero studies and even less common sense arent
worth the considerable time it must have taken you to type in  His
assumptions look frighteningly close to those pseudoscientific studies
that the white supremist assholes love the crap that takes published
statistics twisted around in an attempt to prove the inherent criminal
nature of black people

He makes valid points about demographic differences  You then resort
to the kind of argument that the Politically Correct movement often
uses to stifle any debate  Nice real nice


This authors essay contains 0 independent study upon which to base his
conclusions just some strained disjointed statistical discourse attempting
to blame Seattles murder rate on blacks 

One doesnt have to produce his own data in order to point out the
flaws in the methodology and conclusions of anothers study Again
you resort to PC tactics
