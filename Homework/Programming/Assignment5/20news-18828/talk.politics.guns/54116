 Dont be silly  Of course you can  The police have everything 
 the gangs have and then some  Plus theyve got access to the 
 National Guard via the Governor if things get too rough  Thats 
 tanks for those of you whove never seen them at play  Of course 
 theyve got rifles and helicopters
 
 And as far as fullyautomatic weapons you can be a lot better
 armed if you want to hit what you aim at

 What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally 
 blown out of proportion  In my post I was referring to your 
 regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs gang 
 members  Of course the police have access to the things that you 
 mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time  Of 
 course they dont and thats the point I was trying to make  Every 
 day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in  The 
 majority that I see are still carrying revolvers  Not that there 
 is anything wrong with a revolver but if youre a cop that is up 
 against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat I 
 mean semiauto handguns youre going to be at a disadvantage even 
 with training

how so i think youre making assumptions here that might not 
necessarily be true my personal choice would be a semiauto but 
revolvers are just as effective if not more so

 I have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were 
 practicing shooting  They were actually practicing taking out 
 their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they 
 werent doing too badly either

relevancy please you sound shocked but that hardly proves anything

 The University cops here who are are state cops are armed better 
 than the Chicago police  It seems most state cops are  I dont 
 know where you are originally from David but you live in Tennesse 
 and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news and in 
 the papers  I think the situation is just a tad different here 
 than there

wait doesnt Chicago have serious gun control if so why do the
police need all that firepower in the first place sarcasm alert

all the patrol cars ive seen around here have shotguns clamped to 
the dash board IMHO thats all the police need to outgun just about 
anything
