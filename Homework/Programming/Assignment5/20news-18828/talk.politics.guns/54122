The University cops here who are
are state cops are armed better than the Chicago police  It seems most
state cops are  I dont know where you are originally from David but you live
in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news
and in the papers  I think the situation is just a tad different here
than there

Which crap the ridiculous assertions that Uzis are mowing down cops
right and left The assertions that dialing 911 should be the proper
and only option available to the lawabiding citizens

A factoid

around 100 in the early 80s Wow a real explosion in cop killings
