    Drugs are banned please tell me when this supply will dry up
 
    Drugs are easier to manufacture easier to smuggle easier to hide
    No comparison
 
 Then lets use another examplealcoholic beverages  Bottles of whiskey
 are larger heavier and more fragile than bags of drugs  Barrels and
 kegs are larger and heavier still and are difficult to manipulate
 Yet a lot of people managed to get very rich off of the smuggling of
 booze into this country during the years of Prohibition  There was a
 demand so an entire industry formed to supply it

	If alcohol were again banned today it would be MUCH more
	difficult to manage a largescale smuggling operation 
	The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military
	in communications intelligence gathering and firepower

	In a similar vein the amount of marijuana smuggled into
	this country has greatly decreased This is because its
	valueperpound is very low when compared to cocaine or
	heroin Its simply not worth the risk its uneconomical
	Now most reefer is domestic There is less pressure on
	the domestic producer showy raids notwithstanding and
	thus it is economical 

       Heres a question  If most marijuana is domestic and
producing it here is economical why would we expect it to be
imported

       Of note though  domestic reefer
	is now very strong so a small volume goes a long way
	You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof  not a
	good dollarpound deal 

       Yet it was done  Done quite successfully for a number of years
Somebody thought it was worth the risk

	Firearms tend to fall into this low dollarpound area
	It would not be economic to smuggle them in 

       Your assumption is that this low dollarpound area is
sufficiently low as to make gunrunning unprofitable  On what
do you base this  

       And given that smuggling channels are already established
and given the economies of scale would it really add significantly
more expense to start smuggling firearms especially considering
doing so would be less hazardous in terms of getting caught than
drugs

       All production
	would have to be local 

       Now that was a jump  In any case define local  Its
a big country
 
       There are not all that many people
	who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile
	firearms from scratch Highranking crime figures could
	obtain imported Uzis and such but the average person and
	average thug would be lucky to get a zipgun  and would
	pay through the nose for it 

       Wow you gotta love the speculation

       As I posted before we import billions upon billions of raw
ores across the Mexican border  Not only that but ships come in and
out of US harbors every day full stuff  And customs doesnt even
have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out  

       Id be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be
worth more than a shipload of raw ore and youre virtually guaranteed
to get it past customs because theyd have to hand search every hold of
every ship which came through

       Its not simply a matter of how much money are they worth but how
much more money are they worth than other goods based on the likelihood
of being caught  Less money than drugs but also a safer thing to smuggle
