Fox says

this measure as it will prevent the evil Bambikillers from hunting
and another will fight it for the interference with Nature that it is

Such a measure would also have another benefit It would relieve the
various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds
of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually Im
sure that to attain sure a lofty humane liberal and ecologically
not to mention politically correct goal the environmental and animal
rights groupsindividuals supporting such a measure would be more than
willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased
taxation to replace these lost revenues I am equally confident that
these same entities given their noteworthy record in the area of social
responsibility and respect for private property would feel morally
and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the
hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands
solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowners To
do less than this would place these same groupsindividuals in
the ethically untenable to say nothing of environmentally and
politically incorrect position of sanctioning the logging and
subsequent development and urbanization of these former private
hunting lands which would no longer be useable by or of any
benefit to the landowners in such a capacity
