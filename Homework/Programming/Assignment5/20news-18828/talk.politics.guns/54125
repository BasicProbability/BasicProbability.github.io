 How effective are personal defense products like mace pepperspray
 tasers and other nonlethal stun devices compared to handguns
 Any statistics on s and types in use
 
 These products seem very attractive compared to handguns
 because being nonlethal they are more forgiving of accident or
 mistakeswrongful shooting such as the Yoshi Hattori case and
 allow the justice system to deal with the criminal rather than
 criminals simply being dead which has a certain vigilante feel
 which seems to bother antigun people

The more forgiving nature also has its down side it allows a criminal
to use them wo the ADW assault with a deadly weapon charge  They also
can have lethal or dangerous side effects 
  some people have violent reactions to macepepper sprays
  stun guns can harm people with weak hearts
  people have suffered eye damage from mace the stuff that is available
   now is less concentrated than it used to be
  some of the spray propellents are flammable

 
 The arguments I see against these nonlethal weapons compared to
 handguns are lack of range lack of stopping power or effectiveness
 and limited ammo  True  How about cost

Sprays

 using any of the spray based eg mace pepper indoors is bound to
  affect anyone else in the room like the victim due to the nature
  of the stuff

 using the sprays outdoors in any sort of breeze mitigates its 
  effectiveness

 from reading various articles it appears that mace especially the
  mace available to citizens is pretty ineffective on people under
  the influence of drugs or alcohol

 pepper spray appears to be more effective but has the inherent spray
  delivery problem  It still does not appear to be anything better than
  a distraction that might buy you time to run like hell if you can

Consider that running like hell isnt always a viable solution  For
example if you are dressed in boots and the assailent is dressed in
sneakers  you might have a tough time outrunning them

Tasars and Stun Guns

 require contact with skin for max effectiveness a jacket like a 
  leather one will mitigate its effectiveness

 the user must be extremely close to the assailent that puts them
  at a considerable risk of injury 

 the user must keep the stun gun in contact with the assailent for some
  non negligible period of time

 tasar darts can be pulled out

Consider the problem a small women would have keeping a stun gun in 
contact with a average size man for any length of time wo sustaining
serious injury

 
 Have any antigun groups suggested nonlethal weapons to counter
 the progun argument that people will be left defenseless

I havent heard of any  Generally they contend that people dont
need to or arent able to defend themselves

 
 And what legal restrictionslicensing apply to nonlethal devices

Civilian ownership of stun guns is frequently illegal NY  The sprays
are also illegal in some states  Believe it or not they are still 
illegal in NY although about half the state thinks they are legal
I believe that NY almost legalized them i have heard that the reason
they didnt was due to their ineffectiveness

I feel that the sprays are better than nothing but only if the user
does not believe the hype thisll drop em in their tracks stuff
and uses it as a diversion only

 and last but not least a disclaimer  These opinions are mine       

What about guns with nonlethal bullets like rubber or plastic bullets Would
those work very well in stopping an attack
