What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of
proportion  In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car
cruising around the city vs gang members  Of course the police have access
to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the
time  Of course they dont and thats the point I was trying to make  Every
day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in  The majority that I
see are still carrying revolvers  Not that there is anything wrong with a
revolver but if youre a cop that is up against some gang member with a
couple
of automatics in his coat I mean semiauto handguns youre going to be at a
disadvantage even with training

      This is the arms race fallacy  That somehow bigger guns make an
individual safer  The problem is that for each corresponding level of
offensive power the is not an automatic level of defense increase  The
problem is that theres a sort of lethality threshold that once you get
past youre only talking about a metter of degree

      Regardless of what cops are up against theres really no reason
for the average beat cop to have anything bigger than a pistol on him
as a personal weapon and maybe a rifle and a shotgun in the cruiser

      I mean think about it  Carrying a monster pistol or submachinegun
doesnt make the cop any less wounded if somebody shoots him  A lot
of police departenments have switched to semiautomatics as better
more reliable weapons and more stopping power but theres a point
of diminishing returns

This is a very very good point  Who cares what kind of gun youve got if
youre lying on the ground dead

      And as far as automatics go any gang member carrying around a
couple of automatics an incredible rarity is going to be far more of
a menace to himself and innocent bystanders than anything he might be
tryinh to aim at  One auto is hard enough to control  Anybody who
could control two is going to get the police officer regardless of
what the police officer is armed with

        My question is this  What would a police officer gain from
having a submachinegun or similar personal weapon that he already
doesnt have with a 9mm or 10mm semiautomatic pistol  I dont see
as how the police should be hosing around fullauto fire nor has
my experience with police officers or the stats regarding how many
police officers get killed by other cops made me feel such would be a
good idea  Precise fire is far more preferable  Nor should they using
bigger guns  Most standard sidearms have more then sufficient
stopping power when properly applied  All more powerful weapons would
do is make the likelihood of death higher without really giving police
significantly more options

Another very good point that is well taken  It seems that when lots of lead
is flying either the cops or the gangs someone innocent always gets caught
in the crossfire

your pushed me down the elevator shaft  Im beginning to think you dont
love me anymore  Weird Al

All points made above are well taken  I guess I am in the mindset of
having more makes it better which is obviously not the correct mindset
to take in this discussion  Now that I think about the situation a
little more carefully I see your point exactly David and I
wholeheartedly sp agree  Like I said Im just assuming that more
bullets andor bigger bullets is better  Once again though I want to
state that I am a progun individual and do NOT believe that gun control
is really a viable option here in the United States regardless of the drivel
that I spout here
