stuff deleted all mine

Define armed better Go shoot a revolver and a semiauto like the
Colt 45 Does one fires faster than the other Nope Aside from which
faster rate of fire is usually not desirable Sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover but just YOU trying hitting anything with a Thompson
in hosemode This is why the military is limiting its M16 now to

Aw come on  It worked great in the 1920s or the movie version of the 20s
anyways 

3round burstfire Simple semiauto would be better but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful

A revolver is equally capable as a semiauto in the same caliber

stuff deleted about how revolvers are just as good as semiautos

All your points are very well taken and things that I havent considered as
I am not really familiar enough with handguns

Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers Too many were having
accidents partly due to the poor training they received Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR

Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety

Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police dont know nothing about firearms Turn off COPS and Hunter
and pay attention I do not seek here to say semiautos are junk
merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid A cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot

Actually I dont watch those shows   And youre right at least partially
I dont know much about handguns  Im more familiar with rifles

Gun control is hitting what you aim at If you whip out a
wondernine and fire real fast you may find you dont hit anything
Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit
I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver If I havent hit
what Im aiming at in the first 5 shots something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres While I might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the  of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than 5

What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime Why the same nice simple
38 revolvers that the police often use Well actually some police
prefer the much heftier 357 Magnum but anyway

ObPlea Dont flame me I prefer semiautos for most things But they
        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nervewracking
        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal


If everything had gone as planned everything would have been perfect

No flames here  All your points are well taken  Guess I still have a
lot to learn but thanks to this discussion I already am   Guess I
assume too many things like more bullets are better and that sort of
thing  Of course you know what happens when you assume
