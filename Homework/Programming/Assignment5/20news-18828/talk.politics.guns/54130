Subject Re The pill for Deer  No Hunting

Promising field experiments are being done this year in several areas of
the country relating to chemical contraceptive baits for deer Preliminary
data suggests that this will be a costeffective and humane method for
preventing overpopulation of habitats

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation
in Australia do not in any way support the costeffectiveness of this
approach  It may be costeffective for deerif you quietly overlook
the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is negative
ie a profit because the majority of hunters pay for licences
The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
to be employed to cull the animals which is not in fact the case
You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
pellets or spread baits

There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently
because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor
Generals residence has now reached plague proportions  Despite the
whines of the rampant animallibbers the most effective method of
controlling the population is still considered to be controlled
shooting

So now why should we allow hunting  to prevent overpopulation of
the deerbearwhatever  Sorry but that justification of blood
lust is now gone with the wind Once massproduction of this stuff
begins animal populations can be easily managed without a shot being
fired  This leaves only the fact that some people like to go out
in the woods and kill things

Some people take satisfaction IMHO legitimate satisfaction in eating
food that they have harvested themselves  The pleasure derived from
hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables
grown in your own garden and in general game meat is probably much 
freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or
the supermarket

 That may be a motivation but it
cannot now be justified Expect PETA and like organizations to use
this argument to get hunting banned  period 

By cannot now be justified I guess you mean that you personally
dont see any justification  Finebut what makes your opinion
so important

With no legitimate hunting with the papers filled with stories of
senseless murders  I guess there wont be a chance in hell of
building a case for the RKBA that will withstand either public
opinion necessity or scientific scrutiny Dont give me that
silent majority wants guns crap  they are and will be silent
No votes for RKBA no RKBA 

Certainly the last point is correct  If politicians dont see any
votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing
and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the 
incidence of violent crime they wont do these things
