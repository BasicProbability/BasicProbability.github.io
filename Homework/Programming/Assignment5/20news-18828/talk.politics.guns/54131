Subject Re Boston Gun Buy Back

 From urbininterlaninterlancom Mark Urbin
 
 RMJust a short thought 
 When you ask the question of the authorities or sponsors of buyback
 programs whether they will check for stolen weapons and they answer
 no its total amnesty

     Please note that the 50 given for each firearm in the Boston buy 
 back will not be in cash but money orders  How much total amnesty can 
 you get if you leave paper trail behind

In the latest case in Denver they were giving away tickets to a Denver
Nuggets basketball game 

How traceable is a money order  I dont know Havent used one in 20 years

Is that even an issue if the weapons arent checked for being stolen
