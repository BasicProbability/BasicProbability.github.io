iSince there was no sniper fire doing nothing was equally effective
as was yelling stop that  Of course if one wants to credit the
tanks with stopping nonexistent sniper fire we might was well credit 
it with stopping an invasion by Martians

There was precisely ONE
verified sniper in the 67 riots a drunk firing a pistol out a window

Actually there was only one confirmed sniper to die in Detroit
according to Sauter  Hines Nightmare in Detroit A Rebellion  Its

What sources did Sauter and Hines use  In Congressional hearings
later the newspaper folk admitted that their reports were completely
wrong  Some of their excuses are understandable while others amount
to gross negligence  Then theres their we lied  As far as I
know they never did the followup

So  People other than snipers can shoot firemen  If they are
shooting at snipers cant help  Blowing big holes in buildings that
dont contain sniper nests or worrying about travelling sniper
squads is a complete waste of time

Interesting  Just curious they do you believe that tanks did blow
big holes in buildings in Detroit 67

I dont have any relevant knowledge about the countersniper tactics
or what the govt did with the big war toys  Thats why Ive only
commented on what they couldnt have accomplished no matter what
they did

Nope  the sniper fire was coming from other policeguard positions

The guard certainly needed to learn  But I dont agree with the
idea that there were no snipers at all  From p 121 of Sauter  Hines

     Despite the force of the National Guard in alliance with the
Army troops the snipers did not stop  The snipers boldly lay siege to the
Fifth Precent police station and took pot shots at the Seventh  Firemen
were under constant harassment from snipers fired from halfclosed
darkened windows in high apartment buildings and from rooftops

Not in Detroit not during the 60s  Thats newspaper copy and they
admitted later that they were wrong
