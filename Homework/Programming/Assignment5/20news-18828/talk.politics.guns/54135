 Self defense is a valid reason for RKBA

	The vast majority get through life without ever having to
	own use or display a firearm 
 
        You might have missed the US News  World Report excerpt
 I posted  It is fairly consistant with other such polls finding
 that approximately 4050 of households have at least one firearm
 How this translates into individual ownership is questionable but I
 think its fairly safe to say that youre wrong about the vast majority

	OK  a nearmajority actually OWN firearms but I will still
	claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even
	threaten anyone with them What do they do right  or are
	they just lucky  In either case this means the average
	threat level in this country is rather low 
 
       Besides there are other
	means of selfprotection which can be just as effective
	as firearms 
 
        Please name them  The key phrase is can be  Theories are
 nice but practicality is more important  A taser to chose an
 exmpale outlawed virtually everywhere can be as effective as a gun
 under optimal conditions when dealing with your absolute average
 

	I think you have weapons on the brain I never said that these
	alternative means of selfprotection involved any hardware
	Why are good neighborhoods good  It isnt because every
	person is armed to the teeth It is because of 1 attitude
	and 2 cooperation In the good neighborhoods the residents
	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
	strangers are lurking around Good neighborhoods form groups
	like crimewatch to increase this effect and the relative
	effectiveness of the police When hostiles are arrested the
	good neighbors step up and say THATS the one officer  He
	was robbing Mr Jones house 

	In short the alternative to firepower is gangs  or at
	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative
	Replace lead with flesh  the flesh makes a better
	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a
	block party 

 Freedoms and rights are not dependent on public opinion necessity or
 scientific scrutiny

	New to this planet  EVERYTHING is dependent on either public
	or political opinion usually political To imagine that
	inalienable rights are somehow wired into the vast cold
	cosmos is purest egotism and a dangerous delusion
 
        In a very real sense everything the government does is based
 on public approval if for no other reason than at any particular time
 there arent public servants commonly adorning trees
 
        But legality and legitimacy also matter  If a governments charter
 makes a rule which the government then violates it is violated the
 basis for its existance  Enforcement of its will becomes a matter
 solely of force of arms

	Oliver North The man is positively worshiped in many
	allAmerican conservative quarters He and Big Ron
	setup a secret government and did all sorts of severely
	illegal deeds  the kind of stuff you and I would be doing
	twentytolife for yet he walks free This BS happens all
	the time In fact it happens so much that no one really
	cares anymore  Legitimacy is a nonissue Legality is
	a nonissue So long as we get Tbones and our MTV who
	gives a rats ass  

 No arguments against RKBA can withstand scientific scrutiny

	They dont have to Like so many other things the issue
	is one of perception rather than boring statistics
 
        Excuse me sir but you were the one suggesting that arguments
 for RKBA would not stand up to scientific scrutiny

	No I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical
	aspects of the argument Pure emotion like the abortion issue

	Every time some young innocent is gunneddown in a drive
	by every time some kid is murdered for a jacket every
	time a store clerk is executed for three dollars in change
	every time some moron kills his wife because she took the
	last beer from the fridge every time someone hears a bang
	in the night  the RKBA dies 
 
         Emotion is hard to argue against  But it must be done anyway if
 emotion is wrong

	Argue away  you cant win 

       The stats are not all that
	clearly behind firearms  
 
         And just yesterday you claimed they werent behind them at
 all
 
       the protection factor does not
	strongly outweigh the mindless mayhem factor 
 
         Operating under the assumption that the same conditions absolutely
 govern both of them  That the expansion of one automatically necessitates
 the contraction of the other

	Firearmsrelated mindless mayhem will be related to the
	availibility of firearms If they become scarce and 
	and expensive a different psychology will take hold
	I think they would be used far less to settle trivial
	complaints
