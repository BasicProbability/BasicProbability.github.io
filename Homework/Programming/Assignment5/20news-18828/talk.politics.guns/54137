Subject Re Ban All Firearms 

As quoted from 1993Apr141844482331gnvifasufledu by jrmgnvifasufledu

 	Firearms tend to fall into this low dollarpound area
 	It would not be economic to smuggle them in All production
 	would have to be local There are not all that many people
 	who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile
 	firearms from scratch Highranking crime figures could
 	obtain imported Uzis and such but the average person and
 	average thug would be lucky to get a zipgun  and would
 	pay through the nose for it 

You dont know much about modern automatic weapons do you  Just about ANYBODY
with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns  A 
couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building 
submachineguns in the school shop

I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of Smallarms of the 
World  Your entire premise is based on nonfactual assumptions

 

Youre like a bunch of overeducated New York jewish ACLU lawyers
fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in
