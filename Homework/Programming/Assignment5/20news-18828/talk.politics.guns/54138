 What about guns with nonlethal bullets like rubber or plastic bullets
 Would those work very well in stopping an attack
 
 						Doug Holland

 Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially
lethal  Even blanks which have no projectile can cause death if the
muzzle is in close proximity to the victim  I have heard of rubber or
plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations where the
intent is crowd control rather than close range self defense ive also
seen reports of deaths caused by them the British in Northern Ireland
 Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the
gravest of situations at that point i consider deadly lethal force to 
be a proper reaction and so does the law  
 Furthermore use of less effective but still potentially lethal force
has its own set of problems  It may well take more applications of the
less effective force to stop the incident this places all parties at some
risk the victim because the attack has not stopped and the assailent 
since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be
more deadly
