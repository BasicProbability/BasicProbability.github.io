    Drugs are banned please tell me when this supply will dry up
 
    Drugs are easier to manufacture easier to smuggle easier to hide
    No comparison
 
 Then lets use another examplealcoholic beverages  Bottles of whiskey
 are larger heavier and more fragile than bags of drugs  Barrels and
 kegs are larger and heavier still and are difficult to manipulate
 Yet a lot of people managed to get very rich off of the smuggling of
 booze into this country during the years of Prohibition  There was a
 demand so an entire industry formed to supply it

I beleive this was the source of the Kennedy clans money
 
 So unless theres something Im missing I think your argument that guns
 wont be smuggled because theyre more difficult to manufacture smuggle
 and hide wont wash  If enough people want something somebody will try
 to supply it
