 	Observations from a naive norwegian
 
 	1 Guns are made to KILL people not to shoot target or to 
 	have something more macho than stamps to collect
 
 	2 It IS more easy to killinjure someone with a gun than
 	with a knife or a bat as in baseball
 
 	3 Its not very wise to compare two completely different
 	countries like USA and lets say Island on issues like
 	crime and violence
 
 	4 Yes the problem is  people committing crimes not the tools
 	beeing used but 1 should be taken into concideration
 
Only as far as it affects the crime rate
 
 	We have a very strict gunlegislation in Norway but until recently
 	it was possible for enyone over 18 years to buy a shotgun
 	Shotguns are used mainly for hunting in Norway but because it
 	was so easy to accuire one it was THE most used gun in crimes
 	The solution was to restrict the sale so its now necessary to 
 	apply and register your shotgun
 	And unbelievable the use of guns in crime fell

Did the RATE of crime fall  If not the ban was of no use  It is the rate of  
violent crime that matters not the tools used  Its the crime stupid

 	There are now a new law against wearing long knives in public
 	and why should it be allowed 
 

Apparently that became the weapon of choice after the shotguns were banned   
After that theyll decide the car of choice  is the Saab and propose a ban on  
that

 	What I as an scandinavian have problems to understand is that 
 	you Americans have a more liberal view on guns and violence
 	than on nudity and sex
 	Try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder
 
 	Yes I know a little American history but is it a civilhuman
 	right to have an assault gun in your home andor an handgun
 	in your car
 

Yes  We still trust honest people here  For the time being

 
 			The bad english is not my fault its probably
 			the keyboardsoftware or the quality of the
 			subtext on tv
 
 
 	Disclamernot
 	These are the views of all studens at my university
 	all Norwegians and probably whole of the universe
