Some of the progun posters in this group own no guns  The dread 
Terminator aka The Rifleman owned no firearms for several years 
while posting in this group as an example  There are others

Good point Kirk

Hes still around too  Hes responded by email to a couple of my posts 
and gosh darn hes gotten down right civil  This happed about the time 
he got his first firearm  Wonder if there is a relationship here  Turns
out that MOST people at least the ones who are not criminals to start
with act responsibility once given the chance
