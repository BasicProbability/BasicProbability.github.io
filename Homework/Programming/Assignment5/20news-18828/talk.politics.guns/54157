Consider a similar structure
A welleducated electorate being necessary for the security of a
free State the right of the people to keep and read Books shall not
be infringed

Now does this mean only the electorate can keep and read books  Does
it mean only registered voters can keep and read books  Does it mean 
only those who have voted can keep and read books  Does it imply any
restrictions AT ALL on the right to keep and read books

But it would imply that the state had the right to regulate and enforce
education

Thats nice but it doesnt answer the question  There is a difference
between the feds can mandate literacy and the feds cant interfere
with literacybook possession

As far as John Q Public with a gun the Supreme Court has already
ruled in cases such as US v Miller 307 US 175 1939 and US v
VerdugoUrquidez 110 S Ct 1839 1990 that that is EXACTLY what 
the amendment protects  This interpretation can be found as far back
as the Dred Scott case in 1857

Its worth noting that US vs Miller sustained Millers conviction
of possession of an illegal firearm noting that a sawedoff shotgun
was not a proper militia weapon Therefore US vs Miller supports
limited government regulation of firearms

Actually the Miller court did nothing of the kind  It remanded
the case back to the trial court because the miller court didnt
know if the weapon in question was a militia weapon  Doesnt it
bother anyone that a major constitutional issue was taken up in
a case where there was no defense  Miller had been released by
the appeals court and disappeared  only the govt was represented

We dont know what would have happened with the reasonable all guns
are militia weapons argument
