Subject Re Clinton wants National ID card aka USSRstyle Internal Passport


The idea of the card is bull in and of its self but Im curious to know do 
they plan on making it a requirement to always have it on you or is it 
only going to be required to be presented when trying to ge medical aid

BTW anybody planning on shaving Hillarys head to look for 666 8

Later Dave

Goverment logic or just the Clintons
