This isnt recguns so maybe this is getting a bet technical but I
cant resist

  A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
   the trigger again

Sometimes  Depends on WHY it misfired

  A doubleaction revolver almost all of them can be handcocked first
   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger

I cant imagine doing much combat type shooting single action

  A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
   to rotate to the next round

Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate

  A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
   hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an
   easy motion even one handed

Never hurts to err on the side of safety but if youve got one of those
new fangled hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties its unnecessarily
redundant  Id rather have the extra round

  Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
   on semiautos Can be faster depending on users

Quite true  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
than magazines though

  A misfire in a semiauto will require you to clear a jammed shell
   first time spent which can be fatal And a vital second or so is often
   lost as you realize hey its jammed before starting to do anything
   about clearing it

True but this is a training function

  Most semiautos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
   and cock the hammer Some police carry their semiautos with the
   chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged I do not consider
   this safe however You must tradeoff safety to get the same speed
   of employment as a revolver

Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense  The 80 series Colts for
example are quite safe to carry this way

  There are some doubleaction semiautos out there but the complexity of
   operation of many of them requires more training

Agreed

Now that Ive shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this up  It
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesnt cost you much  On
the other hand Ive had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years  For example Ive had FACTORY ammunition that has had high
primers  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem
An auto  Jack the slide and continue

Ive had bullets come out of the case keeping the cylinder from
turning see clearing paragraph above  About the WORST that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed  This can be cleared in seconds

Most revolvers are more fragile then semi autos  There are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved  Dropping the gun or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action  Many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a quality semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver  In short a revolver MAY be less likely
to malfunction but as a rule when it does youre out of the fight
The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category

Vincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them  A real good starting place is Ayoobs The Semi
Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense

In general Id agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm

Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms  If the department
isnt going to train them they arent going to take the time on their
own  There is no doubt that training is an issue  The amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver  Many cops dont bother

For myself Id hate to be limited to one or the other  Id rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination what Im wearing that day
and so on  Like the Moderator on recguns says buy em all

That said I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is right after taking a class get a
Ruger or Smith revolver  Sorry Colt fans  Colt revolvers are ok
too

If this post had gone the other way Id be arguing for revolvers
