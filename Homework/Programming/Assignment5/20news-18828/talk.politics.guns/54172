What all you turkey propistol and automatic weapons fanatics dont seem to
realize is that the rest of us laugh at you You dont make me angry you
just make me chuckle 

Steve
     Its nice that you find me laughable but I dont quite
understand  Is it because you think my firearms clash with
what Im wearing or that my NRA sticker isnt on straight
Please state your judgement 
     I find it sad that people wont accept the responsibility
to defend themselves  And I laugh with the same contempt you
have for me at the sheep who expect the government to protect
them

What he didnt realize was that we took a photo of the back of his truck and
showed it to our friends when we got back to Vancouver  Canada where Im from
originally People were guffawing at the basic stupidity of such a
sticker and the even greater stupidity of the person who put it there in the
first place 

You and your friends sound like a bunch of smug intellectuals

Now that I live in Britain I can see how the rest of the civilized world
perceives you gunnut morons 

Oh   I guess you are  Im still waiting for you allknowing
academiclikes to solve the worlds problems  Let us know when
you have the answers or punch lines as this case may be

The only problem is that Canada I hear is suffering from your national
eccentricity in that easy to purchase weapons are being smuggled cross the
border

So its not a Yankee thing
Are Canadians actually as uncivilized as we Americans

Hell here in Britain the cops dont even carry guns 

Well if its anything like here it wouldnt matter if they
did they wouldnt be able to use them

Hell as I recall in Peoples Court even Rusty carried a gun Never
know some plaintiff might go nuts   

You shouldnt waste your time watching TV Steve It will corrupt
your mind


Anyway all you gun nut Rush Limbaugh fans please keep up your diatribes
against Brady and other  evil Liberal media plots   you re so damn funny
You provide endless amounts of entertainment in your arguments and examples of
why someone should be allowed to carry a piece Keep us all chuckling

Ditto to you Self Righteous One
Lay your derogatory tirade on thick Steve  Yall can keep laughing and
Ill keep feeling safe and secure


Steve
