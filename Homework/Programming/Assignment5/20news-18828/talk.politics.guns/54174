 Again my response is so what  Is Mr Rutledge arguing that since
 the local and federal governments have abandoned their charter to support
 such activity and passed laws prohibiting private organizations from 
 doing so that they have eliminated the basis for the RKBA   On the
 contrary to anyone who understands the game they have strengthened it

No I originally argued that the Second Amendment was a little bit
and an anachronism  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are
an anachronism  After all laws in made by representatives of the 
people  These representatives of the people have already decided
that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some
cases  Since these representatives feel an unconditional 
interpretation is not wanted then it is probable that they majority
of the people feel the same way  If this is so it is an example
of the people using their power of government  If this is not
how the people feel the people should stand up and state their wishes

       Ill point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment
process was to require a supermajority to change the Supreme Law
making it impossible for a majority of the people to simply change
the law on a whim  Simply changing the meaning based on the
representatives of the people effectively destroys the amendment
process  The States you know are also entitled to a say under
that process
 
 Mox nix Mr Rutledge  YOU are the only one here claiming that the
 RKBA is dependent on the existence of a topflight wellregulated
 militia  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a 
 number of times  

No I simple stated that the people have a right to join a well
organized militia 

       Ill note that that right could be considered protected under
the first amendments protection of peaceful assembly  Unless
you would consider a militia inherently nonpeaceful then theyve
stated the same thing twice
