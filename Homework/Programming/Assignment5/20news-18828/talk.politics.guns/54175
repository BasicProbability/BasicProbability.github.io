What all you turkey propistol and automatic weapons fanatics dont seem to
realize is that the rest of us laugh at you You dont make me angry you
just make me chuckle 

       Thats nice  We strive for entertainment value       

 I remeber being in Bellingham Washington and seeing a
pickup truck in front of the car that my friend and I were in It had a bumper
sticker proclaiming Gun Control is a firm grip on a 45 Now Im sure that
that wanker thought he was pretty cool
What he didnt realize was that we took a photo of the back of his truck and
showed it to our friends when we got back to Vancouver  Canada where Im from
originally People were guffawing at the basic stupidity of such a
sticker and the even greater stupidity of the person who put it there in the
first place 

       In the first place you have to realize the feeling goes both
ways  Canadians laugh at the US and Americans simply shrug and
woner why the hell we let them be a State in the first place         

I knew somebody else who went to one of your Gunmart superstore places just
so he could experience the sight of people putting guns and ammo into shopping
carts I didnt believe it myself until I drove by one in Vegas last year

       Interesting strategy posting here with complaints about
people elsewhere

Now that I live in Britain I can see how the rest of the civilized world
perceives you gunnut morons 

        Courtesy is apparently a dead commodity in the rest of the
civilized world  Gun nut morons indeed        

The BBC recently referred to the American 
penchant for pistols automatic weaponsetc  very  appropriately  it was
called a national eccentricity

        Weve got guns theyve got a monarch and an economy on the verg
of collapse  Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time

The only problem is that Canada I hear is suffering from your national
eccentricity in that easy to purchase weapons are being smuggled cross the
border

       Canada has been blaming the US for their problems for years
The simple fact of the matter is this  Ten years ago they crowed about
how great their system was because theyd gotten rid of the guns and
the US would be so much better if theyd just get into the divine light
shining from the North  We pointed out that it was cultural differences
and pointed to their precontrol crime rates  We also pointed out that
the history of the entire world contained smuggling and that whenever
something was wanted it was smuggled in
       If the problem were based on US guns it would have surfaced
years before

       Now more Canadian criminals want guns  And they are being provided
Canada has its own version of the drug problem  Yet drugs are prohibited
in the US

Hell here in Britain the cops dont even carry guns Thats another funny
thing  you see a US border guard and hes got his 45 or 38 on his belt
with tons o spare ammo  never know maybe some canadian shopper might get out
of hand Hell as I recall in Peoples Court even Rusty carried a gun Never
know some plaintiff might go nuts   

       Saw a news report out of Britain that armed crime is on the rise
and several police agencies are considering have permanent firearms
officers to deal with it

       According to US News  World Report British handgun deaths have
risen over 250 over the past twelve years  The US number has dropped
5

       Maybe theyre smuggling them across the USUK border  Yeah
thats the ticket

CYA

       Have a nice day Steve  Learn a little common courtesy and
politeness
