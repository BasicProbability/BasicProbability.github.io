Subject CNN for sale


WK Gorman

3 Maybe nows the time for us the NRA GOA CCRTKBA SAF et al to band
3 together and buy CNN as our voice Wouldnt that be sumpinbroadcast
3 the truth for a change and be able to air a favorable progun item or two

3I would like to see this happen I dont think it will I dont
3think the average gunowner will take any notice of what is happening
3until they break down HIS door

3BUT I will go on record publicly to the effect that I will contribute a
3minimum of 100000 to the buyout fund if it can be organized and made
3viable Anybody else want to put their money where their mouth is  
3There ar 50 MILLION gun owners out there If  and its a big and
3not very realistic if  we got hold of CNN the antigun bullshit would
3STOP RIGHT THERE Why wont it happen  because nobody will get off their
3ass and MAKE it happen Nuts

Any NRA headquarters weenies listening to this man Any RTKBA organization
honcho listening Its time to stop fighting the Bradys and the Schumers
now theres an interesting meaning to the acronynm BS from the comfort
of the officewe had better get serious with our time and money and get
after it or we might just as well pack it in now

  OLX 22  Gun control advocates must have had a sanity bypass
