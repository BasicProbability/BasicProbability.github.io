Of those who vote your cause is considered an abomination No matter
how hard you try public opinion is set against the RKBA 

Nope  Here in Northern California a newspaper recently did a survey
asking if people favored stricter gun controls  A full 40 said no
Here in one of the most Liberal it wasnt always a swear word  areas
of the country nearly half the people dont want additional controls let
alone revocation of RKBA

This is the end By the finish of the Clinton administration your
RKBA will be null and void Tough titty

Misguided dolt though he may be though I still maintain less dangerous
than Bush Clinton does not publicly support revoking the second amendment

Surrender your arms Soon enough officers will be around to collect
them Resistance is useless They will overwhelm you  one at a time
Your neighbors will not help you They will consider you more if an
immediate threat than the abstract criminal 

Well Ill help MY neighbors

Too fucking bad You have gone the way of the KKK Violent solutions
are passe Avoid situations which encourage criminals Then you will
be as safe as possible Such as it is 

Violent solutions are passe  I take it you propose disarming the police
then

Please dont mention RKBA in the same breath as the KKK  RKBA is about
being able to defend yourself and others not about killing the innocent
Actually your mention of the KKK is rather funny considering that the
first gun control law in the US were created specifically to disarm black
people
