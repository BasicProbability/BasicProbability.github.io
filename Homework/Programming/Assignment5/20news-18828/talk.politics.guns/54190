Yea there are millions of cases where yoy say that firearms
deter criminals Alas this is not provable

      Not provable  Its about as provable as the number of votes
vast for Bill Clinton in the last election  If you accept the information
available you can prove one way or the other  If you refuse to accept
it nothing is provable

I think that that
there are actually few cases where this is so 

      Fine support your assertation  But you havent supported
any assertations just yet

      The National Crime Survey that secret Arm of the NRA estimates
between 40000 and 50000 withgun selfdefenses from assaults and
is considered to considerably underreport  When broken down by weapon
there is no form of selfdefense including dowing nothing which is
more effective at avoiding injury or death

The bulk of firarems are used against unworthy and unnesessary
opponents   those who posessa a cool jakcet you want those who
would argue with you about a parking space those who would
take your woman In short trivial and worthless causes

      Ok support this assertation  Hell support one

Too much of this has ruined you cause There is no recovery 

      Thats nice

In the near future federal martials will come for your arms

      Thats nice too

The 2nd amendment is dead Accept this Find another way

       Why on Earth should we  If youre correct weve nothing to
lose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain
