Abuse by the goverment
This seems to be one of the main problems Any harder guncontrol
would just be abused by the goverment
Either some of you are a little paranoid no offence 

       Mr Parsli I have to take exception at this  There are
verifiable previous examples of levels of US governments
abusing guncontrol restrictions  I dont think it is paranoid
to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused
in thye future  After so many times of getting burned any sane person
will stop putting his hand on the stove

OR you should
get a new goverment You do have elections

       Id love to  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell
pork back to their constituents theres not a lot I can do  

       Its silly to suggest that if theres anything we cant trust
the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed
to do it then we should change governments  Down that road lies
total government power   Ive never been a fan of totalitarianism

Guns n Criminals
MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen

       This is very likely

Known criminals can NOT buy weapons thats one of the points of gun control
And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia and most of europe
we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns

       The North American Continent is not Europe no matter how many
people would like it to be  Drugs are very illegal and theyre
here  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control  If it is
necessary to control guns over the whole continent then Canada should
have always had comparable rates to the US yet they still dont
Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more
magical than the Mexican border which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled then I really cant accept that argument

Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one
What I meant was that cars CAN kill but they are not GUNS

       No there are approximately 31000 deaths due to guns in the US
twothirds of which are suicides  Unfortunately I dont have suicide
rates for Norway  However this makes the pergun death rate about
half the percar death rate

The issue I hope
I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem
Guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for

I think this discusion is interesting when you think of exJugoslavia
They should all have weapons its their rigth to have them and if they use them
to kill other Innocent people the problem is humans not guns

      The problems been humans since before we had stone axes  The
fct of the matter is simply this  If nobody ever assaulted anybody
whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent

      Yet weapons are built  Id suggest then that the murderous
impulse in humanity predates weapons

      Anyway the Bosnians et al have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years  Taking away their guns even
if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality

If 50 of ALL murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them
or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem
its the axer 
An example dont flame me just because not exactly 50 are killed by guns


       In the US approximately 60 of murders are commited with firearms
50 with handguns 10 with nonhandguns  The reason I say that guns per 
se are not the problem is that our nongun rate exceeds most of Europes
countries entire violent crime rate  I dont really think weve got
more knives or fists  

       In any case I think examples of gun control applied to the US
have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition  Until you deal with why people are doing what they
are doing you wont solve your problem  And if the problem is 
violent crime you shouldnt concentrate on the tools instead  The
vast majority of guns is never ever misused  On the order of
995 over the entire lifetime of the gun  This says to me that
you cant make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse

Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
themselves Is this a good situation  

       The situation is not good in that people fear for their lives
But recall the scenes of the storeowners during the last riots
protecting their shops with guns  Would it have been better they
too lost their livelihoods

Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem 

       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles no it isnt
However if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can
be appropriate  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition
wont make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it

       You have to examine which problem youre referring to  If
youre discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is
a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop  Hopefully
simply letting them know youre prepared to shoot them would be enough
as it was with the abovementioned storeowners

If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have
guns what do you think will happen  I mean if everybody had a gun in USA

       45 of Households have some form of firearm usually a long gun
That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans
Firearm ownership is most likely among educated welloff whites the
group least likely to be involved in violent crime

       You may take that for what its worth
