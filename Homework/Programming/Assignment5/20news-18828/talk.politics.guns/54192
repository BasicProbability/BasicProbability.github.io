Subject Re What to do if you shoot somebody

In article 93108025818U28037uicvmuicedu Jason Kratz U28037uicvmuicedu writes
Say youre in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody  You
give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their
action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them  My question is
what do you do  Should you stay and wait for the cops or should you
collect your brass if youre using a semiauto and get out of there
provided of course you dont think that you have been seen

For me it would be an obvious choice Armed selfdefence is clearly
and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws
of the state In the very clearcut situation of your hypothetical
I wouldnt have anything to fear from the police unless I had been
publicly carrying the weapon concealed something Im not in
the habit of doing Even then the worst Id have to deal with 
was a class 2 misdemeanor Even if the situation were not so
clear and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
homicide it would still be safer to wait for the police If
I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement Id be committing
several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming selfdefence
in court If it really was selfdefence the prosecuter would
ask why did you run away and hide from the police

In other states however this decision might not be so clearcut
If someone in say Washington DC were to use a gun in selfdefence
he would automatically be guilty of several felony violations of
that citys gun control laws Such a persons choices would be
between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
conviction for half a dozen
