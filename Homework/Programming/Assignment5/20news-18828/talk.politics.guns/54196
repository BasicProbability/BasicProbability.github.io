       No what you said was that we had spent money on guns rather than
people as Canada does  Which is ridiculous


Once again I have over estimated the general level of intellegence of
the average reader of rushlimbaugh  Canada PER CAPITA spend more
money on people where the US spend more money PER CAPITA on guns

What exactly do you mean when you say the US spends more per capita on
guns than Canada does  Are you talking about the US government or are you
talking about the purchase of guns by private citizens or both  If you are
referring to private citizens then your point is irrevelant because what
individuals do with their money is essentially their business

If on the other hand you meant that the US government spends more per
capita on guns than Canada does then your point is relevant  So if this
is true then the US needs to get its priorities straight  People are more
important than guns  That is not to say that guns arent important  Im
just saying that if the US government does spend more per capita on guns
than they do on people then something is awry


    He meant the US spends more per capita on guns than Canada which isnt
really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from
the USSR that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending

    I would like to see if the US spends more per capita on people than 
Canada does  This is a true apples  apples comparison where the previous
post was apples  oranges
