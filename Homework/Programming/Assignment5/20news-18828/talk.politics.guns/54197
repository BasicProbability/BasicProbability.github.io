Randy WeaverKevin Harris trial update Day 4

Friday April 16 1993 was the fourth day of the trial

Synopsis Defense attorney Gerry Spence crossexamined agent
Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald
Howen  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied

The day was marked by a caustic crossexamination of Deputy
Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence  Although
Spence has not explicitly stated so one angle of his stategy
must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper  Cooper is
the governments only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan
Spence attacked Coopers credibility by pointing out discrepancies
between Coopers statements last September and those made in court
Cooper conceded that You have all these things compressed into
a few secondsIts difficult to remember what went on first

Cooper acknowledged that he carried a 9mm Colt Commando submachine
gun with a silenced barrel I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver
Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific
plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weavers dog

When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degans
M16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead Cooper could not say for
sure that Degan did not return fire before going down

Spence continued by asking with how many agents and to what extent
had Cooper discussed last Augusts events Cooper responded If
youre implying that we got our story together youre wrong
counselor  Spence continued to advance the defenses version of
the events Namely that a marshal had started the shooting by
killing the Weavers dog  Cooper disagreed

Assistant US Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spences
virulent crossexamination of agent Cooper arguing that the questions
were repetitive and Spence was wasting time  Howen also complained 
that Spence was improperly using a crossexamination to advance the
defenses version of the events  US District Judge Edward Lodge
sustained many of the objections however both lawyers persisted
until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to
admonish both attorneys  Im not going to play games with either
counsel  This has been a personality problem from day 1 so start
acting like professionals

Spence told the judge that When all the evidence is in well see
that  his agent Larry Cooper testimony is not credible that
he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events 
Spence continued Were going to findthat there is a very unlikely
similarity  almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter  between
the testimony of Mr Cooper and the other witnesses

Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howens repeated
objections would prevent a fair trial We cant have a fair trial if the
jury believes Im some sort of charlatan if the jury believes Im
bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that Im
violating court orders

Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howens
objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was preposterous and
denied the motion for a mistrial  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict
his comments when objecting

The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg
Rampton  The prosecutions purpose was simply to introduce five
weapons found in the cabin as evidence However the defense seized
on the opportunity to further address Coopers credibility

Defense attorney Ellison Matthews Harris other attorney questioned
Rampton about the dog  Rampton stated that there were no specific
plans to kill the Weavers dog without being detected  Matthews then
had Rampton read  a Septtember 15 1992 transcript in which Rampton
had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon
was to kill the dog without being detected if the dog chased them
Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that
but he could not remember when  He then stated that I did not conduct
the primary interview with Deputy Cooper but I have had conversations
with him since the interview was conducted

Monday April 19 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial  Scheduled
is the continued crossexamination of FBI agent Greg Rampton
