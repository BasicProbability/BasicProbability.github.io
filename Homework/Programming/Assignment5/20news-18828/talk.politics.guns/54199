Subject S414 Brady bill loopholes

Hi Ive just finished reading S414 and have several questions about
the Brady bills S414 and HR1025

1 Are these the current versions of the Brady bill
     What is the status of these bills  Ive heard theyre in committee
     How close is that to being made law

2 S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar  Are there any important
   differences I missed

3 S414 seems to have some serious loopholes
  A S414 doesnt specify an appeals process to wrongful denial during
     the waiting period other than a civil lawsuit  S414 has an appeals
     process once the required instant background check system is established
     but not before
  B the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denyingapproving
     using existing records so who would I sue in A above to have an
     inaccurate record corrected
  C S414 includes an exceptiontowaitingperiod clause for if a person
     can convince the local Chief LawEnforcement Officer CLEO of an
     immediate threat to his or her life or life of a household member
     But S414 doesnt say exactly what is considered a threat nor does
     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception
     statement
True  Have I misunderstood  Any other holes

4 With just S414 whats to stop a person with a clean record from
   buying guns grinding off the serial numbers and selling them to crooks
   At minimum what additional laws are needed to prevent this

   Seems at min a gun counting scheme would be needed
   eg John Doe owns N guns  So if S414 passes I wouldnt be surprised
   to see legislation for stricter hardertoforge IDs plus national gun
   registration justified by a need to make the Brady bill work

Please comment  Im mainly interested in specific problems with the current
legislationI dont mean to start a general discussion of the merits
of anyall waitingperiod bills ever proposed
