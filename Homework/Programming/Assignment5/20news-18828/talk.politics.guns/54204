Frank Crary says

I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by
 taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting

That is the recommended way to practice with a CCW too  Aim alone is no   d
goo
for defense if you cant get the gun rapidly

Very true but the way it was being done was just a little unusual  It looked
to me like they were practicing to shoot someone

The point that I forgot to bring up here and this has nothing to do with being
a gang member or not is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this
area or in the state of illinois for that matter  This is not to say that
people in Illinois dont carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like
that when there are other people around wasnt too bright of an idea


There isnt necessarily a conflict between practicing with a concealed
weapon for selfdefence and practicing to shoot someone Armed
selfdefence does occasionally involve shooting an attacker

I agree      If you dont practice at all and carry a gun for selfdefense you
most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise
