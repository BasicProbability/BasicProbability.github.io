I have heard many opinions on this subject and would like to hear more from
the people on the net

Say youre in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody  You
give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their
action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them  My question is
what do you do  Should you stay and wait for the cops or should you
collect your brass if youre using a semiauto and get out of there
provided of course you dont think that you have been seen

       As a data point from Tennessee a friend of mine and a police
officer essentially recommends that if you can fade away  Even if
you were perfectly justified youre likely in for a great deal of
hassle  A side note carrying a gun concealed is a misdemeanor

This is exactly what I have heard before  If you were to fade away and
nobody saw you what kind of evidence would they be able to get to catch you
this is assuming that you either collected your brass or had a revolver

What kind
of laws are on the books regarding this type of situation  What would
be the most likely thing to happen to you if you stayed and waited and
it was a first offense  What would happen if you took off but someone
saw you and you were caught

       Its one of those by State things pretty much

Guess its time to take a trip to the library and look at the Illinois statutes
again   Just for the record folks Im just asking this because Im curious
Im just trying to find out from people who have read more on stuff like this
