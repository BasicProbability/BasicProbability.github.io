realize is that the rest of us laugh at you You dont make me angry you
just make me chuckle  I remeber being in Bellingham Washington and seeing a

Ah that British sense of humor  Probably got a real gutbuster going
when the IRA blew that kid up a couple of weeks ago huh  Of course
in Britain your government has ordered you defenseless so your way
of coping with violent criminals is to laugh at victims

pickup truck in front of the car that my friend and I were in It had a bumper
sticker proclaiming Gun Control is a firm grip on a 45 Now Im sure that
that wanker thought he was pretty cool

I dont know about a 45  My own preference is for 9mm

What he didnt realize was that we took a photo of the back of his truck and
showed it to our friends when we got back to Vancouver  Canada where Im from
originally People were guffawing at the basic stupidity of such a
sticker and the even greater stupidity of the person who put it there in the
first place 

Ah Canada  Where the criminals dont bother with checking to see
if the victims are home  They just break on in  Americas a little
different you see  Criminals worry a bit more about getting shot
so they more frequently check to see if anyones home

I knew somebody else who went to one of your Gunmart superstore places just
so he could experience the sight of people putting guns and ammo into shopping
carts I didnt believe it myself until I drove by one in Vegas last year

Ive heard Gun World in Phoenix Arizona is fantastic  Im hoping
to visit there myself soon

Now that I live in Britain I can see how the rest of the civilized world
perceives you gunnut morons The BBC recently referred to the American 
penchant for pistols automatic weaponsetc  very  appropriately  it was
called a national eccentricity

Ah Britain again  Isnt that the place where youre guilty until
proven innocent  Tell me Mr jajvaxoxfordacuk didnt Britain
come begging to us gun nut morons in the early 1940s for guns to
defend yourselves against Hitler  Seems as though your supposedly 
enlightened government had disarmed you Aw chaps you can jolly
give up your guns  If that Hitler man starts to threaten we can 
always hit up the Yanks for a few guns  Theyve got a bloody
eccentric habit about those guns you know  Just hand in your
shotgun thats it  Thank you 

The only problem is that Canada I hear is suffering from your national
eccentricity in that easy to purchase weapons are being smuggled cross the
border

Aint it just amazing how those black markets work  Damn if those
drugs from south america keep coming over our borders too even
though weve banned them  Guess we might as well legalize them  
Makes you want to send fifty bucks to the Libertarian Party just
thinking about it doesnt it 

Anyway all you gun nut Rush Limbaugh fans please keep up your diatribes
against Brady and other  evil Liberal media plots   you re so damn funny
You provide endless amounts of entertainment in your arguments and examples of
why someone should be allowed to carry a piece Keep us all chuckling

Your closeminded ignorance is without parallel  I guess thats what
happens when youre raised as a subject without rights  Your
type gravitates to those who desire to hold power over you

Hell I miss those NRA ads with Gerald McRainey now that Im over here Those
were like Monty Python sketches

Just chuckle as the cops beat you senseless to get a confession
Just laugh yourself silly when you find that confession is valid
in court  Hey mate this is justice British style
