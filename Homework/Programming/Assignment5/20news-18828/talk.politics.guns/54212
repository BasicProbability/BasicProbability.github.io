Article in this mornings Houston Postnegotiators send food to
rebellious inmates as humanitarian gesturespeaking about the Ohio prison
riot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards

I know its not the same group but the mindset appears to be common to
those what rule here latelythey wont give diddley to the BDs in Waco
but they treat criminals as deserving of humanitarian gestures

This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more
priviliges in todays society than their victims or other law abiding
citizens What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the leaders of
the system

Could it be that the criminal is one of the tools the authorities are
using to excuse some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon
the law abiding citizen in the name of crime controldont solve the crime
problem because then the citizen couldnt be held hostage to our help

If the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizenvictim at the
expense of the criminal none of the crap such as RICO and gun banning could
be used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every
move and thought
