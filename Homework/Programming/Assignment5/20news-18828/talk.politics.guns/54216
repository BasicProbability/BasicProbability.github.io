You are loosing
         
There is no question about it 
 
You cant spell There is no question about it

Of those who vote your cause is considered an abomination No matter
how hard you try public opinion is set against the RKBA 
 
We must be reading different public opinion polls I agree that the
misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned mainly because
they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use
in violent crime  1 but if public opinion were so deadset
against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer
would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress
a LOT easier than they are And as governments go broke and can no
longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people
will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms Contrary 
to what you might think time is probably on OUR side not YOURS

This is the end By the finish of the Clinton administration your
RKBA will be null and void Tough titty
 
Yeah right Dont hold your breath My condolences on the discovery
of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands but this has nothing
to do with the issue at hand

 ridiculous tripe deleted 
 
The press is against you the public the voting public is against
you the flow of history is against you  this is it 
 
Yeah the liberal press doesnt like us much but you cant really
expect coherent thought from them anyway Their opinions are based
more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts which
are generously provided by the FBI if theyd bother to put on their
Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them Most of my friends
are antigun and without exception NONE of them bases hisher opinions
on facts They would rather believe despite all evidence to the
contrary that disarming lawabiding citizens would make the world
more civilized when all it really does is make us all sheep They 
would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how
society has driven the criminal to rob rape and murder They 
support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum
who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society
or its laws They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun
control NYCDC have the worst crime and areas with little gun
control VTNHID have very little crime in comparison But they
have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront
the fact that lawabiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that
are causing most of the trouble in society Oh no we certainly cant
accept that But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making
significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly
hurting them and their families they will probably whistle a different
tune They just better hope it isnt too late then

Surrender your arms Soon enough officers will be around to collect
them Resistance is useless They will overwhelm you  one at a time
 
Hmmm I wasnt expecting company tonight I might be able to whip
up a quick cheese and cracker plate but they should probably bring
their own drinks Do I have time to vacuum the rug

Too fucking bad You have gone the way of the KKK Violent solutions
are passe Avoid situations which encourage criminals Then you will
be as safe as possible Such as it is 

Im glad you ended the posting here Your medication seems to have
worn off
