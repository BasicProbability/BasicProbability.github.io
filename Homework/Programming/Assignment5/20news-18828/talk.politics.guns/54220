 BVI read in the paper yestarday that Ted Turner wants to trim down
 BVhis media holdings and is putting CNN up for sale  The 1 potential
 BVbidder  TIMEWarner of course  Sigh      Just what we need 

 Maybe nows the time for us the NRA GOA CCRTKBA SAF et al to band
 together and buy CNN as our voice Wouldnt that be sumpinbroadcast
 the truth for a change and be able to air a favorable progun item or two

I would like to see this happen I dont think it will I dont
think the average gunowner will take any notice of what is happening
until they break down HIS door

BUT I will go on record publicly to the effect that I will contribute a
minimum of 100000 to the buyout fund if it can be organized and made
viable Anybody else want to put their money where their mouth is  
There ar 50 MILLION gun owners out there If  and its a big and
not very realistic if  we got hold of CNN the antigun bullshit would
STOP RIGHT THERE Why wont it happen  because nobody will get off their
ass and MAKE it happen Nuts

I will join the ranks here  If someone has the ability to actually put this
thing together and get enough support Ill also contribute 1000 to the 
effort  And jeeze people Im a student with no job yet and I will
put up my own hardearned savings if it means we have a shot at getting
the truth told on the airwaves  Count me in
