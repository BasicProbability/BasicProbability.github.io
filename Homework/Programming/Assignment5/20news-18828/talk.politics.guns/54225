  I balance my gut reaction to question authority together with the 
  independent facts as I see them on video  I usually adopt the 
  scenario that is simplest and most plausible  I do not generally 
  believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely 
  scenarios
  
 Then answer the question  Why was NO ONE ELSE permitted to talk to Koresh 

  Koresh had a lawyer Deguin who he spoke to in person several times during
the last few weeks 

 It cannot be denied that if they had left them alone there would have been 
no fire yesterday

  This strikes me as a tad ingenous  If X had donenote done Y then Z would
never have happened  I tend to place tha responsibility on the groupperson
actually committing the act not on those whon forced them to do it

  After all to take an extreme example if the British were not in Northern
Ireland the IRA would not be forced to place bombs in shopping centers

  That said this whole sorry story was a totally unecessary utterly fucked
up mess from the get go
