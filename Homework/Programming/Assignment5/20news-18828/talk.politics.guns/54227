 Do you know how many deaths each year are caused by selfinflicted gun
 shot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters

No but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings
Ive never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists
that he has so Id love to have a cite

If you fall for example
 and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow the gun will discharge

Wrong  Theres one gun design where that can happen and it is
supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber
Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
the hammer  In other words it can be usefully carried in a safe
manner  Other handgun designs dont have that property if their
trigger isnt pulled the hammer cant hit the firing pin

 The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of
 deaths caused by animal attacks or wacko attacks combined

The breakdowns that I do have include the above category  From them I
can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims a large
negative number of people are killed by animals because we know that
the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
number of accidents due to gun failures which is a superset of the
described circumstance is near zero

I can find the figures if you dont believe me

Please do  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at
context  Make sure that your source excludes other types of
accidents and suicides that are misreported  Gun cleaning
accident is policespeak for the family needs the insurance
money
