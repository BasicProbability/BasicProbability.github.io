         You might have missed the US News  World Report excerpt
  I posted  It is fairly consistant with other such polls finding
  that approximately 4050 of households have at least one firearm

 	OK  a nearmajority actually OWN firearms but I will still
 	claim that the VAST majority never needs to use them or even
 	threaten anyone with them

500000 to 1000000 selfdefense incidents a YEAR doesnt count with you

       What do they do right  or are
 	they just lucky  

Maybe theyre just UNLUCKY  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley
in Boston chances are almost certain that she wont be counted 
as one of those selfdefenders because our local constabulary didnt
consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself  Even though
the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the gun owner column

       In either case this means the average
 	threat level in this country is rather low 

Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida  The average threat
level in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy  Its well
known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because 
they are less likely to be carrying than your natives  Come on up to
Boston or NYC or Washington DC and see how much diddlysquat the 
average threat level in the country means to a resident there

 	I think you have weapons on the brain I never said that these
 	alternative means of selfprotection involved any hardware
 	Why are good neighborhoods good  It isnt because every
 	person is armed to the teeth It is because of 1 attitude
 	and 2 cooperation In the good neighborhoods the residents
 	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
 	strangers are lurking around Good neighborhoods form groups
 	like crimewatch to increase this effect and the relative
 	effectiveness of the police When hostiles are arrested the
 	good neighbors step up and say THATS the one officer  He
 	was robbing Mr Jones house 

Sometimes this works  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors 
on the dance card for the next wave of drivebys  Someone here once
told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix  Ive misplaced the
original text but the story started with one resident calling the 
cops on a gang member  Sure enough a few nights later there was a 
driveby performed at the residents house  Except that this time
unlike in LA the entire street came out and returned fire putting
an end to the cars occupants  The gang packed up and left

Of course in LA or in a place like Florida after the hurricane
your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell
anything

 	In short the alternative to firepower is gangs  or at
 	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative
 	Replace lead with flesh  the flesh makes a better
 	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a
 	block party 

Look nobody is arguing this  I have a fire extinguisher at home  
That doesnt mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches 
on the carpet  I live carefully monitor the woodstove get my flue
cleaned twice a year and test my smoke alarms annually  But if 
DESPITE all this  a fire does start its too late for any of
these things EXCEPT the extinguisher

         But legality and legitimacy also matter  If a governments charter
  makes a rule which the government then violates it is violated the
  basis for its existance  Enforcement of its will becomes a matter
  solely of force of arms
 
 	Oliver North The man is positively worshiped in many
 	allAmerican conservative quarters He and Big Ron
 	setup a secret government and did all sorts of severely
 	illegal deeds  the kind of stuff you and I would be doing
 	twentytolife for yet he walks free This BS happens all
 	the time In fact it happens so much that no one really
 	cares anymore  Legitimacy is a nonissue Legality is
 	a nonissue So long as we get Tbones and our MTV who
 	gives a rats ass  

You seem to be agreeing with your opponent  You cant trust your
government to protect you from abusers and violators  whitecollar
bluecollar epauletted or tankshirted  Ultimately no one has the
power to enforce your rights but you  Unless youve given up that 
power

 	No I claimed that no one is interested in the statistical
 	aspects of the argument Pure emotion like the abortion issue

Too many people fit that category that is true  Some of us like to
believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun 
ownership because theyve been conditioned to believe that there ARENT 
any  You seem content to underestimate the electorate Im willing to
try to raise their consciousness

 	Argue away  you cant win 

I think we can

HCI was founded in what 1980  In the mid80s they ran a One 
Million Strong campaign for two years before reaching this goal  
My understanding is that they reached it by the stratagem of including
wide classes of people other than duespaying members  I cant speak
authoritatively on this  maybe somebody else has details  Then they
started running a Two Million Strong campaign for a while  but they
let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they
simply were never going to reach that level of membership

In 1964 just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings  the starting
point of the modern guncontrol movement the NRA had a mere 625000 members  
By 1968 barely after the first murmurs of future registration it had 
about a million  Today it has over three million members making it the
third largest membership organization in the country next to AARP and AAA
And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time  Historical
figures from Kuklas Gun Control pp 61 and 420

As you say many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused
by their Tbones and MTV  That leaves hardcore gunowners against 
hardcore gun banners

I know a number of exHCI members who have recently become NRA members
Ive never heard of a single one who has gone the other way

Yes I think we can and will win this one

 	Firearmsrelated mindless mayhem will be related to the
 	availibility of firearms If they become scarce and 
 	and expensive a different psychology will take hold
 	I think they would be used far less to settle trivial
 	complaints 

I think they would be used far less to hammer nails as well but
like you I cant give any citation showing that this utilization is
CURRENTLY significant at more than an anecdotal level  If you can 
Im waiting
