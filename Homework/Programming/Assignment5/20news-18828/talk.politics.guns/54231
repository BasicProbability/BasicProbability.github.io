        And as far as fullyautomatic weapons you can be a lot better
 armed if you want to hit what you aim at
 
 What seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of
 proportion  In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car
 cruising around the city vs gang members  Of course the police have access
 to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the
 time  Of course they dont and thats the point I was trying to make  Every
 day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in  The majority that I
 see are still carrying revolvers  Not that there is anything wrong with a
 revolver but if youre a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple
 of automatics in his coat I mean semiauto handguns youre going to be at a
 disadvantage even with training  I have been at a shooting range where gang
 gang members were practicing shooting  They were actually practicing
 taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target
 and they werent doing too badly either   The University cops here who are
 are state cops are armed better than the Chicago police  It seems most
 state cops are

Every city and suburban police officer Ive seen around the Twin Cities in the
last two years has carried a semiauto of some type different brands though
I havent seen any Glocks 

With regard to this discussion  We are getting dangerously far from the usual
rantings of tpg and close to the realm of rg but Id like to put my two
cents worth in  While theres nothing wrong with a revolver especially a 
large frame SW in 357 magnum  my favorite there are valid advantages to
semiautos  I suggest reading Massad Ayoobs I know some people cant stand
him and think hes full of bull but I think that in general his material is
very valid and useful book The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work or something 
like that  He defines a number of ways that semiautos are different and that
different is good  The main advantage is not in increased firepower but in 
more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode  There is also a
certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to 
learn  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar
with different models of semiautos but it was cited as stopping or at least
slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun

 
 Define armed better Go shoot a revolver and a semiauto like the
 Colt 45 Does one fires faster than the other Nope Aside from which
 faster rate of fire is usually not desirable Sure it makes the other
 guys duck for cover but just YOU trying hitting anything with a Thompson
 in hosemode This is why the military is limiting its M16 now to
 3round burstfire Simple semiauto would be better but the troops
 like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something
 often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful
 
 A revolver is equally capable as a semiauto in the same caliber
 
  A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
   the trigger again
  A doubleaction revolver almost all of them can be handcocked first
   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger

Yes but this is best done with a two hand hold  With a single hand you either
pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action  The DA semi
auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot


  A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
   to rotate to the next round

Im not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point  In a DA
semiauto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same
round  an advantage you dont have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will
always go to the next round discussing this point now  This is fine with a dud
but what about a hangfire situation  Granted its very rare but your round will
now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go  Slingshotting the slide
on a misfire takes very little time


  A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
   hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an
   easy motion even one handed

Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not
necessary or usually recommended  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and
at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the
round to set it off

  Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
   on semiautos Can be faster depending on users

The best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed
loaders are very fast  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two
handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed  This means that
while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the
gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always 
take more time  You also dont have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing
a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity  the partial magazine can
still be used if needed later  

 
  A misfire in a semiauto will require you to clear a jammed shell
   first time spent which can be fatal And a vital second or so is often
   lost as you realize hey its jammed before starting to do anything
   about clearing it

Yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear
it  Really though in either a revolver or semiauto the odds of an actual misfire
with factory ammo are awfully small  You are more likely to get a jam in a semiauto
but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns Sigs Glocks etal


  Most semiautos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
   and cock the hammer Some police carry their semiautos with the 
   chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged I do not consider
   this safe however You must tradeoff safety to get the same speed
   of employment as a revolver

  There are some doubleaction semiautos out there but the complexity of
   operation of many of them requires more training

All common semiautos can be carried with a round in their chamber without any
safety problems  While I put that out as a statement that I believe I should
say that this applies to all of the ones Ive looked at  For the DA semis its
no different from the revolver situation  The guns all have hammer or firing
pin blocks  They also have a safety  Because theres no real advantage
carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed
of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of SA followup shots  Im
not familiar with SA semiautos except for the 1911A1  I admit that I was
initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining
the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and 
shooting it a lot I see no inherent safety problems with it especially in
a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer  This design also gets
you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver

 
 Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly
 switching many officers back to the old revolvers Too many were having
 accidents partly due to the poor training they received Not that Glocks
 require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex
 as the timer on a VCR

Yeah the infamous Glock  I still cant figure out how its worse than a revolver
for safety  If you dont pull the trigger it doesnt go off  I imagine that if all
your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger
far enough to fire before you realized it  In addition if you had developed that
nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and
relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew
off your foot then youd have problems when the hammer wasnt there

 
 Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
 the police dont know nothing about firearms Turn off COPS and Hunter
 and pay attention I do not seek here to say semiautos are junk
 merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid A cop
 with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
 equipped for anything short of a riot

I think this is even okay for a riot as long as its a small one B

 
 Gun control is hitting what you aim at If you whip out a 
 wondernine and fire real fast you may find you dont hit anything
 Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit
 I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
 to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver If I havent hit
 what Im aiming at in the first 5 shots something is quite seriously
 wrong somewheres While I might like having the backup capacity of those
 extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the  of shots fired in
 criminal encounters is less than 5

I have the poor mans Beretta Taurus 99 and consider it inferior as a carry
weapon to the Springfield 45 oops 9mm vs 45 arguments are relegated to
rg  You are right though  If you dont hit what you aim at then the
shootergun combination has failed  I dont ascribe failures in the the
fire real fast with a wondernine scenario you mention to the gun  This is
a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training


 
 What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime Why the same nice simple
 38 revolvers that the police often use Well actually some police 
 prefer the much heftier 357 Magnum but anyway

9mms are becoming more popular with crooks too though the 38 does still
lead the list  And like I said around here semiautos seem the rule for the
street cop  Dont know about the State Patrol however they may still carry
the Highway Patrolman

 
 ObPlea Dont flame me I prefer semiautos for most things But they 
         introduce unneccessary complications to something as nervewracking
         as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal

Vincent please dont take any of this as a flame  Just my 002 whoops looks more
like 200 worth  And much of it is IMHO but do check Ayoobs book
