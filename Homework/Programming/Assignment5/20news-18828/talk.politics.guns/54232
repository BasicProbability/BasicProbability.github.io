What about guns with nonlethal bullets like rubber or plastic bullets Would
those work very well in stopping an attack

Ask the Brits  Enough people have been killed by rubber bullets that they now
use them under only certain controlled circumstances  And they are fired
from something that looks like a tear gas launcher

There are smaller rubber bullets and pellets for shotguns  I understand that
they are only intended to be discouragers ie for the snapping but not truly
dangerous animal  In general they do not seem capable of really stopping
someone who wants you or past you  They are fired at very low muzzle velocity
the 38 ball round is intended for a 400fps load  Finally as your mother
warned you you can put an eye out with that thing
