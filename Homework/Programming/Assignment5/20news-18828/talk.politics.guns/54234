All your points are very well taken and things that I havent considered as
I am not really familiar enough with handguns

Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers Too many were having
accidents partly due to the poor training they received Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR

Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety

Ahem  Hrumph  You have encurred the wrath of Glock owners  We will beat
you with our hammers  Oooops dont have any  

Seriously  There is no difference in the safeties betweena Glock and any DA
revolver  Intellectually think of the Glock as a very high cap revolver 
Ignoring stove pipes misfeeds and all the other bonus exercises that
autoloaders give you that is

Every gun has its safe moment and its dangerous moment  If you just learn how
to handle it it becomes a lot less dangerous to you
