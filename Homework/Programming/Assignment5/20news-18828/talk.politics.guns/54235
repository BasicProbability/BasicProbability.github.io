Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store a very well
stocked firearms store I discovered a printed document that was being 
distributed by the good folks who work there  Traders BTW is located in
San Leandro CA


 
The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads  which is why you no longer
see the ads that Traders San Leandro has run for many years

These ads were run for the lawabiding honest citizens who own firearms for
sporting use or selfprotection  They certainly have the right to do so under
the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms
 
Are you sure about this Im currently looking at a copy of last 
Thursdays SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders
ad on page C7 in the Sports section Not only that but there is
a part in the middle which rather prominently says WANTED We pay
cash for assault rifles and pistols Granted I havent seen todays
paper yet But Id be surprised if there wasnt a Traders ad in it
Its probably worth it to write to the Chronicle and other papers
anyway because all their antigun editorials are disgusting

By the way let me put in a plug for Traders I have shopped all
over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower
prices And their selection is amazing
