   Some of the progun posters in this group own no guns  The dread
   Terminator aka The Rifleman owned no firearms for several
   years while posting in this group as an example  There are
   others

For what it is worth I own no firearms of any sort  As longtime
readers of this group know I am dedicated to the RKBA

This is not about toys  It is about freedom
