	I just want to point out that while I am fully in support of privacy
it will be possible soon to have a completely secure ID card useable in bank
transactions medical etc etc

     There is no such thing as completely secure especially when dealing
with High Technology Its all a question of cost what cost are you
willing to bear to protect your information vs what rewards the bad guys
are going to get if they break it The rewards of breaking such a single ID
system would be high indeed
