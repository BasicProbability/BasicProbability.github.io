 RMJust a short thought 
 When you ask the question of the authorities or sponsors of buyback
 programs whether they will check for stolen weapons and they answer
 no its total amnesty

     Please note that the 50 given for each firearm in the Boston buy 
 back will not be in cash but money orders  How much total amnesty can 
 you get if you leave paper trail behind

In the latest case in Denver they were giving away tickets to a Denver
Nuggets basketball game 

How traceable is a money order  I dont know Havent used one in 20 years

       Money orders operate pretty much like checks with both parties being
supposed to sign them  I assume youd have to show the buyback people
an ID and youd then have a money order made out to that ID  

       As far as traceable as a practical matter I dont know it would
depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipients name is
on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in  Id say
certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who
they gave money orders out to

Is that even an issue if the weapons arent checked for being stolen

       There might be some questions asked I suppose if somebody 
brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of buy back
programs
