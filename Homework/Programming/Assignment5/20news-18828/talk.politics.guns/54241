	If alcohol were again banned today it would be MUCH more
	difficult to manage a largescale smuggling operation 
	The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military
	in communications intelligence gathering and firepower

Proof by assertion  I love it  Uh please explain why the smugglers
do not also rank a notch below or above the military in terms
of communications intelligence gathering eg why fight officials
when you can bribe themIll give you a hundred grand to let that
semi past and firepower 

	In a similar vein the amount of marijuana smuggled into
	this country has greatly decreased This is because its
	valueperpound is very low when compared to cocaine or
	heroin Its simply not worth the risk its uneconomical
	Now most reefer is domestic There is less pressure on
	the domestic producer showy raids notwithstanding and
	thus it is economical Of note though  domestic reefer
	is now very strong so a small volume goes a long way
	You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof  not a
	good dollarpound deal 

Whats the point here  Youre arguing that the black market
WORKS which it does of course  

	Firearms tend to fall into this low dollarpound area

This is the wrong way to quantify things  The smuggler would
be concerned about valuecubic foot  Go to a gun show and
price out a crate of good quality handguns  

	It would not be economic to smuggle them in All production
	would have to be local There are not all that many people

Whats local  

	who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile
	firearms from scratch Highranking crime figures could

What is a worthwhile firearm  Hell anything that WORKS  Go
get yourself a copy of the Armys 1969 Improvised Munitions Manual
See how easy it is to make a functional firearm

	obtain imported Uzis and such but the average person and
	average thug would be lucky to get a zipgun  and would
	pay through the nose for it 

If paying 10 for inconspicuous parts at the local KMart is
through the nose
