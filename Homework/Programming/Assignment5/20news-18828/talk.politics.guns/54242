All your points are very well taken and things that I havent considered as
I am not really familiar enough with handguns

Thats not all that Kratz doesnt know

Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety

Now we know that Kratz doesnt understand what a safety is supposed to
do  He also confuses things he can see with things that exist
Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
outside

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS thats
what the user wants  With Glocks one says I want the gun to go
off by pulling the trigger  If the safeties it has make that work
it has a real safety no matter what Kratz thinks
