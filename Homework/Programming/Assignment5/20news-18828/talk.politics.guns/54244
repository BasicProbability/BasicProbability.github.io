 Some of the progun posters in this group own no guns  The dread 
 Terminator aka The Rifleman owned no firearms for several years 
 while posting in this group as an example  There are others
 
 Good point Kirk
 
 Hes still around too  Hes responded by email to a couple of my posts 
 and gosh darn hes gotten down right civil  This happed about the time 
 he got his first firearm  Wonder if there is a relationship here  Turns
 out that MOST people at least the ones who are not criminals to start
 with act responsibility once given the chance

Id like to point out that I was in error  Terminator began posting only 
six months before he purchased his first firearm according to private email
from him

I cant produce an archived posting of his earlier than January 1992
and he purchased his first firearm in March 1992

I guess it only seemed like years
