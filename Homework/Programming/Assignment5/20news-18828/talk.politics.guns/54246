Well this sounds good to me  The key is Section 2c2 which
will effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folks
who cant afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall
All of you whove been saying hey isnt that illegal could just
go hire your own Attorneys on a payifyouwin contingency fee
basis and sue the bums    

What you can do now

1  Write your Representative and ask them to cosponsor HR 1276

2  Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett the sponsor 

        Representative Roscoe Bartlett

        Washington DC 20515

      to tell him who your own Representative is and that youve
     asked them to join him as a cosponsor of HR 1276

3  Contact Gun Owners of America

4  For those of us with a RealJob TM find out how to reach
     Representative Bartletts campaign fund Im working on it
     and toss in a few bucks  You can bet your bippy that hes
     going to be one of the HCI targets in the next election
     which isnt that far away 1994
