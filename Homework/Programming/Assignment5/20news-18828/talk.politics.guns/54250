  Look if you can figure out a reliable means of keeping guns away from
  bad people while not interfering with good people I think wed all be
  for it  The problem is the methods were using now dont do the trick

    Dont manufacture them  Dont sell them  Dont import them
   
    Some guns will get through but far fewer and far less people will
    die because of them  Hunting weapons could be allowed of course as
    long as they are big and bulky and require reloading after a few
    shots how many times can you shoot at the same animal anyways One
    assumes they are moving

A better solution

  If the bad people cant be trusted with guns then lock them or knock
  them off  Stop punishing good people
