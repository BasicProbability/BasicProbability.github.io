 All your points are very well taken and things that I havent considered as
 I am not really familiar enough with handguns
 
 Thats not all that Kratz doesnt know
 
 Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
 that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
 that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety
 
 Now we know that Kratz doesnt understand what a safety is supposed to
 do  He also confuses things he can see with things that exist
 Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
 outside
 
 A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS thats
 what the user wants  With Glocks one says I want the gun to go
 off by pulling the trigger  If the safeties it has make that work
 it has a real safety no matter what Kratz thinks

   I agree very much  I have read almost every article written about
   the Glock and IMO it is probably the safest autoloader made  It
   has the best safty of all Jeff Coopers First Rule Keep your finger
   OFF the trigger until you want to shoot  If everyone just observed
   this there would be fewer accidents
