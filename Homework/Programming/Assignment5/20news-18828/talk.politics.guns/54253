Subject Constitutionality of 18 USC 922o

You know I was reading 18 USC 922 and something just did not make 
sence and I was wondering if someone could help me out

Say USC 922 

1 Except as provided in paragraph 2 it shall be unlawful for
any person to transfer or possess a machinegun

 Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a person 
might also be an artificial entity that is created by government 
and has no rights under the federal constitution So what I 
dont understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on 
an individual So someone tell me how my government can tell
me what I can or cannot possess Just passing a law 
does not make it LAW Everyone knows that laws are constitional
until it goes to court So has it ever gone to court not
just your run of the mill Ok I had it I am guilty put me in jail

Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told
by the Supreme Court that they didnt have that right
