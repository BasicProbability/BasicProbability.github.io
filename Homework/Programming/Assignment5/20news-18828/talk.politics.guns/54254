Subject Cop kills teenager

	OK heres something for all of those people who think cops are always
more responsible then the rest of the population  I found this article in the
Rocky Mountain Collegian Colorado State Universitys newspaper

	SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDE

PROVIDENCE RI AP  A police officer afraid he would be fired for
allegedly assaulting a teenager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth
worked said Youre going to die and fatally shot him and two others police
said

A fourth youth was wounded  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car

The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about
midnight Tuesday and called police  He was hospitalized in satisfactory
condition Wednesday

Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta 23 of Cranston was arrested at
gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilsons Auto Enterprises in
Foster a rural town of about 4000 people in northwest Rhode Island

	Well this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping just
like everyone else  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns
