Some police departments switched to Glocks and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers Too many were having
accidents partly due to the poor training they received Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR

Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety

Ahem  Hrumph  You have encurred the wrath of Glock owners  We will
beat
you with our hammers  Oooops dont have any  

Seriously  There is no difference in the safeties betweena Glock and any DA
revolver  Intellectually think of the Glock as a very high cap revolver
Ignoring stove pipes misfeeds and all the other bonus exercises that
autoloaders give you that is

Every gun has its safe moment and its dangerous moment  If you just learn how
to handle it it becomes a lot less dangerous to you

All very true  Im going on what I have read and heard from friends
Basically the Glock is great but I have heardread that it is a lot harder to
learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has  I was
looking at a Glock 40SW and the SW 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the
safties on the guns were very different  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot
more safe  for lack of a better word than the one on the Glock  Of course
this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody  You
would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off  Personally I
like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool
guess thats why they use them in so many movies but I wouldnt get one as
my first semiauto because of the safety  I would prefer more training with
a traditional semiauto ala Colt 45 but of course thats just my opinion
