Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card


I HATE long postings but this turned out to be rather lengthy


Overall Crime rate
It felljust like that

Acquiring weapons in Norway
You can buy almost all kinds of weapons in Norway BUT you must have a 
permit and a good reason to get the permit
If I would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gunlicence from 
the police and to be a member of a gunclub
The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes andor
records of SERIOUS mental diseases
Now if a got my licence I would have to be an active member of the gun
club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun
Its a little like getting a drivers licence isnt it 
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to

Use of guns in crimes in Norway
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms
for a long time but these are rather the exeption
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short 
time befor the crime

Use of knives
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open
You Americans think its ok to have a gun but not to carry it open
in public rigth 

Scandinavians ARE aggressive
We northeners are not as hotlivered as southeners but when we decide
to take action we DO
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe
Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2

Individual vs masses
Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some
extent
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses 
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others 


The issue
I believe the issue is GUNS and gunlegislation
We shouldnt mix weapons and items that can serve as one
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME
But should it have to be like that 
Do you think its wise to sell guns like candy some states do 
If you believe its smartneccacery to have driverslicence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns 

Disclaimher
Im not a pacifist or anti gun 
I would defend my home loved ones and country but I dont view guns as
neccities or toys
I HAVE done army service and HAVE used a variaty of weapons but wouldnt
want to have one for self defence or because they feel good
