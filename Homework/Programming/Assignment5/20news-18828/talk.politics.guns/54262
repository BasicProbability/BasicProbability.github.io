All your points are very well taken and things that I havent considered as
I am not really familiar enough with handguns

Thats not all that Kratz doesnt know

Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety

Now we know that Kratz doesnt understand what a safety is supposed to
do  He also confuses things he can see with things that exist
Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
outside

Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to do  Its basic purpose 
not to let the gun fire until youre ready  Christ Ive known that since I
had my first Crosman air gun  You dont know me so dont make assumptions
about what I know and dont know  I do know that the Glock has multiple
safties from reports looking at them at a gun shop and friends who own one

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS thats
what the user wants  With Glocks one says I want the gun to go
off by pulling the trigger  If the safeties it has make that work
it has a real safety no matter what Kratz thinks

From the things I have readheard Glocks are always knocked because of the
trigger safety  They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly  Every
article that I have read cant be wrong about the damn thing  And dont ask
me to quote my sources because I dont keep a ton of gun magazines andor
recguns articles laying around  Boy you cant make a simple statement on
here without someone getting right on your ass  No wonder why there are so
many problems in the world  Everyone takes everything just a little too
seriously  By the way  Im not going to reply to any of this stuff anymore as
someone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to rg
And yes I know that I had something to do with that

Jason
