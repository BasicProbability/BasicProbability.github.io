Overall Crime rate
It felljust like that

       Two questions  When was this and do you have the relevant
numbers  Please note this is not in any way an indication I dont
believe you or that youre not correct but when the drop occured is
relevant
   
Acquiring weapons in Norway
You can buy almost all kinds of weapons in Norway BUT you must have a 
permit and a good reason to get the permit
If I would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gunlicence from 
the police and to be a member of a gunclub

       The primary objection beyond ones based on the ideal of
RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do is
that it makes guns a plaything and tool of the rich and connected
It discriminates against the poor

       Is selfdefense considered appropriate and if so under what
conditions  Are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection
if youre going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened

The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes andor
records of SERIOUS mental diseases

       This has been suggested in the US and generally supported among
gun owners  What many object to is that many if not most proposals
contain a sort of gotcha clause which allows an arbitrary denial even
if you qualify in every way

Now if a got my licence I would have to be an active member of the gun
club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun
Its a little like getting a drivers licence isnt it 
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to

       At this point it should be pointed out that in general
a drivers licence in the US is for the most part nothing like its
European counterpart  I understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here  In the US its a joke 

       But my usual objection is that youre discussing two different
things  For instance in the US a drivers license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road  It is not necessary
to own one or to operate it on private property  That is the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the governments legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands  A permit to own an automobile for instance
which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get
past legally since it wouldnt be based on making regulations on public
property but in restricting activity on private property              

Use of guns in crimes in Norway
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms
for a long time but these are rather the exeption
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short 
time befor the crime

Use of knives
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open
You Americans think its ok to have a gun but not to carry it open
in public rigth 

        This varies widely  One thing I think Europeans have
a difficult time with is that the US has fifty unique jurisdictions
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in Europe to another

        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives  Some allow
concealed  Some prohibit both or allow one or the other  And it can
be either a state or local restriciton       

Individual vs masses
Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some
extent
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses 
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others 

       The question must be asked  Is the right of this individual
affecting the rights of this other individual  What we usually
get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within
this group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group  

       If for instance Bob were using his gun to attack Steve youd
have a point  But essentially what were discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own
guns then some third person perhaps in another time zone is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody elses
rights  Its like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one

The issue
I believe the issue is GUNS and gunlegislation

       The issue is crime violence and murder  The question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those

We shouldnt mix weapons and items that can serve as one
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME
But should it have to be like that 

       Of course not  It would be nice if we didnt have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us
But currently we dont have that option  Nor do I expect we will

Do you think its wise to sell guns like candy some states do 

       No state does  In any case theres a limit to which the state
may enforce its wisdom on me  Freedom in general is an unwise
concept  If you preemptively restrict everything which might be
unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless concept
   
If you believe its smartneccacery to have driverslicence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns 

       Ill raise my hand against drivers licenses  As currently
implemented theyre a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of
drivers  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car

       But as I mentioned theyre two different things
