                                     A BILL 
   
 To establish the right to obtain firearms for security and
     to use firearms in defense of self family or home and
     to provide for the enforcement of such right

Maybe Im too religious but when I see a bill to establish a right
I wince  Keep in mind what the law giveth the law can taketh away
