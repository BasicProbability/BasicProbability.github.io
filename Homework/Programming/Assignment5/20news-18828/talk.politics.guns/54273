Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card

 If I would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gunlicence from 
 the police and to be a member of a gunclub
 The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes andor
 records of SERIOUS mental diseases
 Now if a got my licence I would have to be an active member of the gun
 club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun

So like what do you do during those six months to be active
My town has a similar requirement and its rather stupid  Before
you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club
Well how active can you be without a gun chief

Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental
disorders would be a very good thing  IF it couldnt be abused by the
government  But every time this is proposed there is always some
trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you
are perfectly qualified to own a gun  And we oppose this

 Its a little like getting a drivers licence isnt it 
 You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to

Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US 
is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun
owners Id think twice before using this analogy

Besides the problem is criminal use of guns not accidents  There
are about 500000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year  but
only 1400 accidents  I dont think its necessary to spend a lot
of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one

Just like the check most gun owners feel positively about requiring
safety courses  IF they couldnt be abused by the government  But 
they already have  One state doesnt hold the courses another doesnt 
fund them a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence 
to those with political connections  Is this fair

 Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short 
 time befor the crime

And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets
How many are borrowed stolen smuggled bought on the black market

 Use of knives
 It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open
 You Americans think its ok to have a gun but not to carry it open
 in public rigth 

Some states allow ONLY open carry  Some allow ONLY concealed carry
Some allow both  Some allow both but require licenses for concealed 
carry  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage
over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good
then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing
Which means that they really dont have any objective reasons for 
these laws other than their preferences  a bad way to govern

 Scandinavians ARE aggressive
 We northeners are not as hotlivered as southeners but when we decide
 to take action we DO

Hotlivered  I LOVE that expression  Here we say hotheaded

 Individual vs masses
 Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some
 extent
 Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses 
 What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
 all the others 

Typically the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other
people are criminals in government offices  The rest of our criminals
affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time and they do this
during the commission of a crime  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts
NO ONE else  It is when they do something violent with that gun that
the crime occurs  Of course it is a crime for a felon or exfelon to
possess a gun but we dont feel it is right to treat common citizens
who have lived good lives as if they were just prefelons waiting to
commit crimes

 We shouldnt mix weapons and items that can serve as one

I dont understand this sentence

 IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME
 But should it have to be like that 

Life isnt fair  I shouldnt need a fire extinguisher either or
flood and theft insurance or to lock the doors of my house and car
But pining for a better world wont do anything to address what I have
to do to live in this one

 Do you think its wise to sell guns like candy some states do 

None of ours Im sure

 If you believe its smartneccacery to have driverslicence WHY do you think
 it should be free to buy guns 

Frankly Im not sure I know what good a drivers license does anyone
either  The people who drive safely never use it and the people who 
drive drunk drive without it

However a car is a good tool but not one that protects my right to life
I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely

 Im not a pacifist or anti gun 
 I would defend my home loved ones and country but I dont view guns as
 neccities or toys
 I HAVE done army service and HAVE used a variaty of weapons but wouldnt
 want to have one for self defence or because they feel good

The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally  Its
whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do
I dont have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun
I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning
one too
