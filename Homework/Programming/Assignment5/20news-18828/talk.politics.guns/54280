     A note on the lighter side Ive noticed most gunbanners some of my
   friends included are the one who make comments that indicate they are 
   more likely to resort to violent  So are they really banning guns so they 
   wouldnt end up shooting someone else

Could be

It is also likely that since they feel they are more likely to resort to
violence they have a hard time believing that anyone else would react
otherwise

Well I did say well put it out and well put it out when we can
 But I dont know what we can put out or when we can put it out
