 Do you know how many deaths each year are caused by selfinflicted gun
 shot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters

There are roughly 1200 fatal firearmsrelated accidents each year
The large majority involve rifles and shotgun there are under 500
fatal handgun accidents each year I really doubt all of those
occur while the pistol is holstered so the number of selfinflicted
gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters is probably
well under 250 per year

       Im neither a doctor nor a firearms tech expert but it would seem
that given the way a holstered gun points accidental injuries inflicted
that way would be among the least lethal
