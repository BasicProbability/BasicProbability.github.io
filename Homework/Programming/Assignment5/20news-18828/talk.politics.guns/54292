Subject Re My Gun is like my American Express Card

I HATE long postings but this turned out to be rather lengthy

	Thats OK  you can mail me if you want more discussion

Acquiring weapons in Norway
You can buy almost all kinds of weapons in Norway BUT you must have a 
permit and a good reason to get the permit

	Around here longguns are proof of age and fill out the forms
For pistols nationwide check for felonies and three days wait  The
good reason is the difference and one Americans tend to get annoyed
over as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us

Its a little like getting a drivers licence isnt it 
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to

	Not when dealing with America  I can drive an 18wheel truck
with no permit no license and at age 12 if Im engaged in farming
work  Strange that but there is little to no problem with this
Again personal rights versus collective security

Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms
for a long time but these are rather the exeption
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short 
time befor the crime

	Strange that the rates would decline since killing somebody
is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun

Use of knives
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open
You Americans think its ok to have a gun but not to carry it open
in public rigth 

	Why attract attention  I carry my sword openly to and from
practice as that is the only legal thing I can do  I also attract
a lot of attention doing this  Id rather be lost in a crowd of one
than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon  Think of
the word intimidation and you can see where intimidation is not
the preferable method for the normal citizen

Scandinavians ARE aggressive
We northeners are not as hotlivered as southeners but when we decide
to take action we DO
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe
Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2

	Aggressive towards whom  Southerners  Germans  Precisely
why I think your society is less violent weapons aside

Yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some
extent
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses 
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the masses  editor barf  Dan

	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals because
everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another  To
draw an analogy Norway is involved in the EEC  The USA in involved in
NATO  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws  NATO requires
no such changes in USA law  These laws affect citizens and hence
Norway is saying Europe is more important than say Norwegians having
motorcycles that make over 100bhp  In the USA wed likely tell the
EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business in our eyes in
telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride  While I note
that our own state governments often play with game with the federal
government in essence this is a cultural difference between us

IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME
But should it have to be like that 

	It shouldnt  Since neither of our countries has managed to
remove criminals from society in America we feel and remember we
have individual states that are larger than your country that if the
police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves  The criminals
in our country are quite violent hence we prepare for them

Do you think its wise to sell guns like candy some states do 
If you believe its smartneccacery to have driverslicence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns 

	We dont  Email me to find out just how difficult it really
is in this country  It is easier than in yours but theft is far
easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here

I would defend my home loved ones and country but I dont view guns as
neccities or toys

	They are neither  They are an option  We would never force
you to own guns if you lived here  We would however fight to keep
that option open to you

I HAVE done army service and HAVE used a variaty of weapons but wouldnt
want to have one for self defence or because they feel good

	Then you show you are a responsible rational user of weapons
Welcome to our ranks  Now how do we teach the young people this sort
of responsibility  Cultures seem to have a grave impact here

	I notice you didnt use my greatgrandfathers name  Well
he didnt like it much either
