Even though I find this to be funny on the surface the original poster of the
joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of nuts
This may be a dangerous thing to do  It is my opinion that most educated
or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government
This should exist because as a bureaucracy any government given enough time
will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was 
created for  This distrust by the people should keep those in power inline
That and a properly functioning press  When a sensationalism oriented press
portrays a group of people as nuts or crazies a violation of those
peoples civil rights seem justified   Since we as Americans have the 
gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution to include the
2nd ammendment the government must appease the publics opinion or risk 
voted out of existance or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with
domocratic process itself being thrown out by force
  Our government as it stands must appease the public  Therefore the 
official press releases portray the BDs as fanatics who are a threat to
public safety  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information
So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very
agency that was embarrased by the BDBranch Davidians sp  It is to their
advantage to make the BDs as fanatical and dangerous as possible  If they
were portrayed as lawabiding citizens then theyATF had no justification
what so ever of doing what they did
   So lets keep an open mind  Jokes like above even though it may be funny
may mislead the public from the truth of the matter

Just as an aside  my understanding of US vs Rock Island and US vs Dalton
leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act which allows the Feds
in this case ATF to regulate firearmsmachine guns has been deemed to be
unconstitutional since 1986By two federal district courts at least
And since I believe the only reason ATF was involved
in this case is because of firearms violations it would be interesting to 
find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA
It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly
unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deathsLaw enforcement 



The above opinions are mine and mine only
Im solely responsible for my opinions and my actions  If you must flame
then flame away but a well constructed argument will be much more respected
