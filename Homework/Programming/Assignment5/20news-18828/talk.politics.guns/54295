The idea of the card is bull in and of its self but Im curious to know do 
they plan on making it a requirement to always have it on you or is it 
only going to be required to be presented when trying to ge medical aid

This at least has already been determined The Blue Cross medical
coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future
national system To get emergency medical care anyone so insured
must always carry their Blue Cross card Before entering a hospital
you must notify Blue Cross or they will refuse to pay your bills 
In an emergency where you must be treated before notifying them 
you must inform them within 24 hours or if you are unable to do
so for medical reasons the hospital must Failing to do so within
24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization In you need
your card to notify them and without the card the hospital certainly
wouldnt know they had to Therefore you are required to carry
the card at all times or do without emergency medical coverage

Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on the
head and your wallet with your insurance card is stolen  This happened to 
me and it took six months to sort the mess out  These sorts of plans sound
nice at first but in the end they just create a lot of paperwork and
bureaucracy to deal with all the checking and filing they involve
