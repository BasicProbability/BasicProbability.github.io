Subject Re Rewording the Second Amendment ideas


You believe that individuals should have the right to own weapons of
mass destruction  I find it hard to believe that you would support a 
neighbors right to keep nuclear weapons biological weapons and nerve
gas on hisher property  

There is no law prohibiting having biological weapons or nerve gas
on hisher property or even walking on government property with such
items ipso facto it is now ones RIGHT to have such weapons of
mass destruction

Hell the US patent office has patents on the manufacture of nerve
gas that anyone can obtain simply by sending a 150 to the Patent
Office in Washington DC PO Box 8 These same patents are
verboten to English citizens from their own patent office which doesnt
surprise me based on the mistrust of the UK government against private
ownership of semiautomatic rifles

If we cannot even agree on keeping weapons of mass destruction out of
the hands of individuals can there be any hope for us

So you are saying we should have legislation prohibiting owning 
biological warfare agents or nerve agents Will you pass laws against
owning chlorine gas or cyanide as well Will you pass laws against
owning acetylene gas that could have been used against the Bradley
IFVs had the Branch Dividians known of their anticombustion engine
effects Will you pass laws against owning 5gallon cylinders of
propane because they could have been used as flame throwers Yes the 
proverbial Road to Hell its always for Our Own Good
