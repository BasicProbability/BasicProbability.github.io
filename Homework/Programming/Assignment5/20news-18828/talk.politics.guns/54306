Subject Re Ax the ATF


A few comments on the ATFs botched handling of this case

1 Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight  The explanation
   we were given at least at one point was that they thought the cult
   members would be at religious services  My only comment on this bit
   of idiocy is that if youre going to operate as a quasimilitary unit
   youd better understand basic military tactics  One cardinal rule
   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is
   incorrect the operation will fail disastrously

2 We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were
   outgunned they didnt expect such heavy resistance  When
   questioned about why such an overwhelming militarystyle assault
   was planned we were told that it was because the cultists were
   thought to be heavily armed  Can you say contradictory  I knew
   you could

3 The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant
   hotdoggers  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and
   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes  Im
   more than ever convinced thats right on target  An anecdote not
   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up
   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing  Theres
   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by
   the FBI will not be admissible in court  This is not hearsay  I
   was told this by a relative of my wifes who happens to be an FBI
   agent  His opinion of the BATF was ummm well lets just say
   uncomplimentary

4 I have still not been presented with one iota of evidence that
   the BDs had any of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the
   reason for the raid in the first place  BTW were still hearing
   this justification  AG Reno on CNN yesterday made references
   to this issue without any substantiation  She also waved around
   the Hes a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children
   flag  Sigh

5 A point re the Feds in general their handling of the whole siege
   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought
   processes of the cultists  AG Reno said they pushed the button
   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing  My
   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to
   the edge what the hell did she think their reaction would be to
   an hourslong assault on the compound where holes were punched in
   the walls and CS gas pumped in  If I were a BD Id expect the
   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time  In
   that light whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones
   KoolAid is irrelevant  Also look at how the siege was conducted
   Bright lights loud rock music cutting off communications and
   other contact with the outside  All measures designed to make the
   BDs feel more and more isolated and threatened  This might have
   been a great strategy  if they were dealing with criminals  As it
   was it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koreshs
   paranoid delusions
