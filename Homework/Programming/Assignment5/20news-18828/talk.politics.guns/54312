 and Im sure that people who were big fans of fuedalism pissed and
 moaned about the emergence of the modern nationstate Imagine the King
 allowing serfs their freedom if they could live in the city for a year
 Times change technology changes viable forms of social organization
 change While concerns about preserving Western notions of civil liberties
 in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one its
 a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide Its much smarter to focus
 on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are


	Your response is yet another sign of the trend towards One World
Government  Many people such as yourself who are otherwise probably
likeable and intelligent show every sign of having been successfully
brainwashed  You dont recognize that your inevitable tide is rolling
into chaos and in no way represents an advance for civilization  Some
of us do indeed lament the passing of old forms such as the Bill of
Rights which are indeed inalienable rights of man that cannot be
changed transferred or surrenderedrights of man that far transcend


	Yes Napoleon wanted a Grand New Order  Hitler wanted a
Thousand Year Reich  Lenin knew that Bolshevism would give us the
Universal New Man  The New World Order is just so much of the same
old tired garbage  The pathetic part is that so many Americans seem

Put not your trust in princes is the Biblical proverb  The modern
analog is governments  At the time of the founding of the US the
idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not
that common but was explicit in the writings of the founders  To a
considerable extent Englishmen also had those rights

Yes times change and technology changes  The possibility of 
a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until
quite recently  In the feudal system the lord was almost as
restricted as the serfs so having the people enserf themselves
does not make anything better most feudal lords and even most
slaveowners did not mistreat those under them

Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are under real attack NOW
