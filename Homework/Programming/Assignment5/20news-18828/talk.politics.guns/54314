Wisconsin  In a referendum up against all odds the determined
efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April
6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in
Madison Wisconsin was defeated  Despite opposition to the ban 
aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on
the issue  the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the
referendum on the ballot allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to
reverse public opinion on the controversial issue
 
An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found
57 in support and 38 opposed with 5 expressing no opinion  By
election day of the more than 56000 voters who went to the polls
51 cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49 voted to
have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban  The campaign
committee spearheaded by the Wisconsin ProGun Movement and NRAILA
relied on neighborhood canvassing direct mail and radioTV
advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications
raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved
 
Despite the surprising defeat it is expected that the Madison
initiatives chief proponent Mayor Paul Soglin will attempt to have
the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns
