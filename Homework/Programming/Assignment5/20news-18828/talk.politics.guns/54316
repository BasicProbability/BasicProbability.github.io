Subject Re Reasonable Civie Arms Limits

A poster claims he always asks antigunners what they think would
be reasonable personal firepower restrictions OK then 

Caliber  Not greater than 32
Muzzle   Not greater than 300 ftlbs with any combo of bullet wtvel
Action   Single shot rifles and single action revolvers 
          Revolvers bearing no more than six rounds and incorporating
          an antifanning mechanism to discourage Roy Rogers wannabes
Bullets  Any nonexplosive variety HPs just fine

Now  these specs leave the 32 HR magnum as about the most powerful
allowable civie cartridge for handgun or rifle use It would be
reasonably effective against home intruders muggers rabid wolves
and other such nasties even with the firearmtype limitations At the
same time this caliberpower limit would reduce the ultimate lethality
of hits The chances of the average joe encountering a gang of huge
individuals all drunk and stoned on PCP and crystal meth and with a
bad attitude and all armed and willing to die  well its about
zero  far less than the chances of getting killed driving your car

When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isnt
primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties
in the wild  Granted it is a big part but we also need military style
weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door
When ten agents come to my door it would be nice to be able to shoot
all of them for not upholding the constitution to the best of their
ability  It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you
listed above

Please read the Federalist papers for all clarification on RKBA  These
documents have cleared up plenty of misnomers that friends of mine have
had
