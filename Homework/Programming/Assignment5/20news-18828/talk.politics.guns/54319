Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who is
next  The Mormons or Jews

The Koreshians rubbed themselves out  Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene so Im not particularly
concerned  Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also

I believe we still remember Masada where Jews killed themselves rather
than being captured by the Romans  While I do not agree with the
Davidians I must admire their willingness to die for what they 
believed which Jews have had to do often
