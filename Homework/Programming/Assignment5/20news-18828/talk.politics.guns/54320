Well they had over 40 days to come out with their hands up on national tv 
to get the trial they deserved  Instead they chose to set fire to their 
compund hours after the tanks dropped off the tear gas

This is about the third person whos parroted the FBIs line about the
fires being set six hours after the tear gas was injected  Suppose you
want to explain to us the videotape footage shown on national TV last night
in which a tank with the gasinjecting tubes is pulling its injection tubes
out of the second story of a building as the building begins to belch smoke
and then fire

Ive already corrected my mistake earlier in this thread  I saw a brief 
news report which led to the above inaccuracy  I have since seen detailed 
summaries that show the tanks returned in the late morning

So why didnt the BDs leave when the gas was first introduced much 
earlier in the morning  Didnt they care about the children

Why didnt they release the children weeks ago


Do tell
