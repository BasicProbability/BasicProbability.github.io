  Well its now Tuesday morning  Where are those two arsons now  I said  
  yesterday they would vanish and there has been no further mention of them  
  just the desired impression is left
 
   According to KIKK radio in Houston all nine survivors are either in hos
 pitals or in jails  Inlucding the two who allegedly helped start the firess

In the FBI briefing no mention was made of having the fire starters in  
custody
 
  Why could no one else even talk to them  Why could Koreshs grandmother  
not  
  talk to him or even send him a taped message  Why the total isolation
 
   Well it wasnt TOTAL 100 isolation  After the lawyer snuck in the first
 time they the FBI etc let him go back inside several times including I
 think the day before the final assualt
 

Why not his mother  Why not the media
