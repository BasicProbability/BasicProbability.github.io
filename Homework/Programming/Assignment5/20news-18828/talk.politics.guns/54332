  Mr Roby you are a government sucking heartless bastard  Humans died  
  yesterday humans who would not have died if the FBI had not taken the  
actions  
  they did  That is the undeniable truth 
 
 the question is for how long Even if the FBI had done nothing I guess  
the 
 BDs would have committed suicide but maybe not until hunger and thirst gave  
them
 the choice between sucide or surrender 
 The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action They HAD the chance to
 surrender and get a fair trial No matter who started the fire the BDs were 
 responsible for 80 peole dying No one else
 

This is of course your opinion  I differ greatly  There can be NO doubt the  
FBI at least shares in the blame
