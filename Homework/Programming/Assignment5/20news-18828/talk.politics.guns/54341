 wrong about the  whole gunsforprotection mindset it ignores the
 
 Why  If youre not a threat youre not affected at all
 

Aha  Thats the part that makes me nervous too  Who gets to decide if
I am a threat  Based on appearance  Would someone feel more threatened

Actions determine whether someone presents a threat and I dont carry a gun
so much for people cause I tend to fade if there are any about but due to 
several encounters with formerly domestic dogs  these critters aint scared
of folks and can get aggressive

on staying at and saw someone sitting there cleaning his gun  Softly I backed
away and hiked another 5 miles to get out of there  Ill freely admit it here
Im not afraid of guns Im afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry

Id count that as a fear of guns somebody having the sense to keep their
weapons maintained isnt as likely to present a threat  The Army taught me to
clean any weapons DAILY since they usually need it regardless of whether 
theyve been used Youd be amazed how sweaty a holster can get or how much
trail dust will get in it  And I guess youd be scared of me and my former
Explorer Post seems the advisors were National Guard Special Forces grunts
and considered it heresy to be out in the woods without a weapon course 
usually you wouldnt notice em   They tended to avoid public scrutiny

Of course that may be the way to solve the solitude problem  Just carry a gun
and display it prominently and one probably wont see most of the other hikers
out there who will be hiding in the woods  12

My 9mm goes in a hip holster mixed in with magazine pouches hold lotsa stuff 
in them canteens knives compasses and such  Not so easy to notice in 
the off chance I decide to be visible I prefer not to be since walking 
quietly away from active areas increases the number of nonhuman type critters
I see
