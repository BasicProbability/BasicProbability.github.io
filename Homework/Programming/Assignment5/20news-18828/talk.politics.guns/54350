Ahem  See the War on Drugs as sponsored by the Bush and Reagan
administrations  The precedent had well been set for federal agencies to
step on more than a few of what people consider rights  I wont make
excuses for anyone but most of the damage had been done before Clinton
even entered the race in 92

Not to mention last years Weaver affair

Anyway heres how I see the Waco affair Id be interested in other peoples
interpretations

1 Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business
2 Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldnt have
   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations  However I think
   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
   noncombatants
3 I dont see they couldnt just leave a token guard on the place and wait
   the BDs out I dont approve of the tear gas approach and if it caused
   the fire to be started I think the FBI agent responsible should spend
   1020 years in jail
4 However if Koreshs response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there
   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths

   don
