Look if you can figure out a reliable means of keeping guns away from
bad people while not interfering with good people I think wed all be
for it  The problem is the methods were using now dont do the trick

Dont manufacture them  Dont sell them  Dont import them

Japan did this  It required neartotal isolation from the rest of the world
for 2 centuries

Some guns will get through but far fewer and far less people will
die because of them  Hunting weapons could be allowed of course as
long as they are big and bulky and require reloading after a few
shots how many times can you shoot at the same animal anyways One
assumes they are moving

Hunting weapons are great for extortionist sharpshooters  Send me money or
else Ill pick you off from 2 miles away
