2If Guns were banned and a bunch showed up in south florida it
would be 100x easier to trace and notice then a small ripple in the
huge wave of the American guncraze
                  

       Do they teach courses in rude in Canada

They dont have too  Canadian culture is handed down largely from the United
Empire Loyalists who fled from the American Revolution  Canuckleheads tend
to have a cratophilic or governmentloving attitude towards authority

Paul Prescod is right in line with this elitist bigotry and prejudice that
all my Canadian friends hate in their fellow citizens  His sort of snobbish
Canuck have an irrational horror of American democratic armed mobs
