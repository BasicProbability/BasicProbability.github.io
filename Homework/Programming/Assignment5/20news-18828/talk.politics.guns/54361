Subject Re Ax the ATF

In article 1r1173INNajccronkiteCentralSunCOM

Even if it were a capital offense the warrant was not even an arrest warrant
but a search warrant  In other words there was no evidence of illegal
arms just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
search for illegal evidence

Its hard to know whatwho to believe  However the letter I received from
the BATF in response to one I sent to Bentsen said that there was a search
warrant AND an arrest warrant
