 NUT CASE PANICSJUMPS THE GUN ON THE NET BEFORE GETTING FACTS STRAIGHT

I really dont understand all this  I watched on satellite network feeds as  
perhaps 90 people died before my eyes while the two Hueys fanned the flames  
and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate 

Something was VERY wrong with that scene

Perhaps if Id watched RAMBO movies I mightve been dulled to the pain of  
fellow humans dying

Thank GOD I still feel  Im very sorry for you who dont  For you who think  
they got what they deserved  Can you really believe that  Even if Koresh was  
the sadistic mad man they said he was did the others deserve his fate   If  
in fact he was mad wasnt that even more reason to believe he duped his  
followers and therefore they were innocent brainwashed victims  Is there  
any scenaro that justifies all that death

And if not it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  
not FUCKED UP initially and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  
the edge

And thats if you buy the latest version of the story hook line and sinker   
I have believed all along that they could not let them live the embarrassment  
to the BATF and the FBI wouldve been too severe

Remember this was a suspicion of taxevasion warrant  There were no  
witnesses except the FBI  All information filtered through the FBI  All they  
had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  
building and the press couldve done their job and wouldve been able to back  
the FBIs story with close up video while incurring no risk to the press   
Unless they did not want the public to see something  The complete lack of any  
other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern 


Sick to my stomach and getting sicker from all the Government apologists
