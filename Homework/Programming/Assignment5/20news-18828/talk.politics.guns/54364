 but here goes
 
 Monday 19 April 1993 1330 EDT
 
                     MURDER  MOST  FOUL
 
 CNN is reporting as I write this that the ATF has ignited all
 the buildings of the Branch Dividian ranch near Waco TX The
 lies from ATF say holes were made in the walls and nonlethal tear
 gas pumped in A few minutes after this started the whole thing went up
 ALL buildings are aflame NO ONE HAS ESCAPED I think it obvious that
 the ATF used armored flamethrower vehicles to pump in unlit
 napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it
 
 THIS IS MURDER
 
 ATF MURDERERS  BUTCHERS
 
 THIS IS GENOCIDAL MASSSLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN
 
 I have predicted this from the start but God it sickens me to see
 it happen I had hoped I was wrong I had hoped that there was
 still some shred of the America I grew up with and loved left
 alive I was wrong The Nazis have won
 
 I REPEAT AS OF THIS TIME THERE ARE NO  SURVIVORS
 
 God help us all
 
 
 PLEASE CROSSPOST  DONT LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THE SLAUGHTER OF THE CHILDREN

The latest news I saw was that two of the eight known survivors not NO
SURVIVORS as you so rudely put in all caps said they started the
fire

I wont go on with the things the wacko of Waco did
