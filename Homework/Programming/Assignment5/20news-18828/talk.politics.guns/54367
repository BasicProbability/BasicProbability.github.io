as a legal gun owner I must disagree  Even when I dont see eye
toeye with the NRA on a particular issue they are the only
national group which has effectively fought for my rights to target
shoot hunt and protect myself from dangerous criminals  

One more time

It aint about duck hunting

It aint about lone perps on lonely streets

Its about DEFENDING OUR RIGHTS from the GOVERNMENT which 
has seen fit to ignore history and attempt once again to take
them from us  They WILL SUCCEED if we dont do something NOW

Thats why I think the NRA is a bunch of WEENIES because they
have FORGOTTEN that fundamental fact

Pardon all my shouting but there seem to be a whole helluva lot
of people on Condition White fat dumb and happy sucking that
glass teat for all theyre worth Wake up and smell the cordite
gang theyre shooting at us and its high time we shot back
at least with our keyboards 

my two bits

fly your flags at half staff and upside down
