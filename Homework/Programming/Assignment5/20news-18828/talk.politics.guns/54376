  The massive destructive power of many modern weapons makes the
  cost of an accidental or crimial usage of these weapons to great
  The weapons of mass destruction need to be in the control of
  the government only  Individual access would result in the
  needless deaths of millions  This makes the right of the people
  to keep and bear many modern weapons nonexistant

 Thanks for stating where youre coming from  Needless to say I
 disagree on every count

 You believe that individuals should have the right to own weapons of
 mass destruction  I find it hard to believe that you would support a 
 neighbors right to keep nuclear weapons biological weapons and nerve
 gas on hisher property  

 If we cannot even agree on keeping weapons of mass destruction out of
 the hands of individuals can there be any hope for us

I dont sign any blank checks

When Doug Foxvog says weapons of mass destruction he means CBW and
nukes  When Sarah Brady says weapons of mass destruction she means
Street Sweeper shotguns and semiautomatic SKS rifles  When John
Lawrence Rutledge says weapons of mass destruction and then immediately
follows it with

 The US has thousands of people killed each year by handguns
 this number can easily be reduced by putting reasonable restrictions
 on them

what does Rutledge mean by the term
