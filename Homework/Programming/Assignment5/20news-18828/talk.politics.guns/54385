Gentleman are we also forgetting the near genocide of the Native American
for the barbaric act of being heathen ie a nonChristian by a
predominantly Christian government  Thats a little over 200 years as I
recall  Id say that for the most part it was religious persecution
their religion dictated their lifestyle

This is a stretch  In fact a great many of the persecuted Indians were
Christian a great many  It would be simpler to state the obvious that
white people wanted land the Indians dominated or threatened  I really
dont think the government cared a hill of beans about the Indians religion

My Native American Girlfriend asks If the government really doesnt
care a hill of beans about our religion how come theyre still
busting us for it in Oregon Washington and a few other places
Youd be a Christian too if the US Army marched you into church
at gunpoint
