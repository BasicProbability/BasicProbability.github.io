 Anyway heres how I see the Waco affair Id be interested in other peoples
 interpretations
 
 1 Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business
 2 Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldnt have
    disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations  However I think
    the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
    assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
    noncombatants
 3 I dont see they couldnt just leave a token guard on the place and wait
    the BDs out I dont approve of the tear gas approach and if it caused
    the fire to be started I think the FBI agent responsible should spend
    1020 years in jail

  I think the legal term would be negligent homicide

 4 However if Koreshs response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there
    I hold him largely responsible for their deaths


  Well its nice to see someone with a brain a general lack of paranoia and
a willingness to put his thoughts in public  I tend to agree with all you have
said
