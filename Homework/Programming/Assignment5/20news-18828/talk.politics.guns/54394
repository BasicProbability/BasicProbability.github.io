In article donbC5sL69F7Inetcomcom donbnetcomcom Don Baldwin writes

 Its hard to know whatwho to believe  However the letter I received from
 the BATF in response to one I sent to Bentsen said that there was a search
 warrant AND an arrest warrant

Check again  You may find that the arrest warrant was issued AFTER the
first firefight
