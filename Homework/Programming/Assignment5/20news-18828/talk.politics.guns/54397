 Correction The FBI says that two of the nine who escaped said the fire
 was deliberately set by cult members  Since the press was kept miles away
 we have absolutely no independent verification of any of the governments
 claims in this matter

Moreover the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound and as
far as I have been able to ascertain those agents were still in the
compound when the first shots were fired  For all we know these two
people may BE the agents who would certainly be unlikely to stay around
and cook with the faithful

Assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all

Maybe I sound paranoid but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on
how much David Koresh was a big bad child abuser and I kept wondering 
why she  much less BATF  wanted us to infer that she had any 
jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place

Im POSITIVE that the sealed warrant is not for child abuse  What was
it for  Peobably weapons violations  Janet Reno didnt say WORD ONE
last night about weapons violations  Why  Because she knows that such
a case is no longer believable
