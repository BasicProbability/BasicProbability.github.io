       Be cute if Koresh hit the trail

       Maybe he was bodily assumed into heaven  Wouldnt that just
make AG Renos day

snort  I sorta doubt it

However No bodies  By the time this message gets out
theyll doubtless have found bunches but wouldnt it be
interesting if they had a tunnel and  are long gone


If they hadnt killed the ATF people in the original raid I think I would 
laugh my ass off  Actually to be honest I still might
