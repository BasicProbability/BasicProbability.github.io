Subject Re Blast them next time

In article 1r19l97dvusenetINSCWRUEdu oldhamcescwruedu Daniel Oldham writes

 The BATF needs more people better weapons and more armored
 transports When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
 more force instead of retreating to a stand off If you are going to
 do a job then do it right The BATF is there to protect us and they
 must have the proper equipment and people to do the job

The BATF is there to collect taxes not to protect your sorry ass or mine

 With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed
 more now then ever If they blast away a few good fokes then that is
 the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country 

All flamebait of course  If you really want to be flame bait send me
your address and Ill tell the BATF about those automatic weapons you
have stockpiled  Youll be warm in no time
