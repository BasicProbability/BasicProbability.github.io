Does a not harmful gassing mean that you can with a little willpower
stay inside indefinitely without suffering any serious health problems

If so why was CS often employed against tunnels in Vietnam

CS teargas was used in Vietnam because it makes you wretch so hard that
your stomach comes out thru your throat  Well not quite that bad but
you cant really do much to defend yourself while you are blowing cookies
