Subject The Cold War Who REALLY Won

If one reasons that the United States of America at one time represented 
and protected freedom  individual liberty and personal responsibility  
and I do in fact think that this is true and that totalitarianism  
absolute government control and tyranny  represents freedoms opposite 
which it does did the USA really win the cold war

Standard disclaimers ALWAYS apply
