Subject Re Statement to everyone on tpg

Clue  Kratz position isnt a defense against inaccuracy

I oppose gun control because it doesnt work  If it did Id support
it  In fact I supported gun control before I did my homework

Theres no demand for progun people who dont know what theyre
talking about  In fact theyd be much better off if they didnt say
anything

And why is this Freeman  Even if a progun person doesnt know what they are
talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or
two  I am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what I have
to say  I have several good sources of material now that I know where to look
so calm down

Theres lots of information flowing on tpg for those interested in
learning  One can participate in those discussions without ranting
inaccurately  Failure to do so has consequences

Ah Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning  I have also
asked several of the notsohostile folks on this group for sources of
information to read  Do you think Freeman that maybe this means I am
interested in learning  I think it does because as you said people who dont
know anything wont be good for the progun cause

Another good habit to get into is to go readonly for a while to take
the time to figure out how things work

Another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freeman
and accept mistakes  Sure maybe it could have been some type of
misinformation being slung by some antigun nut but it wasnt  I made my
statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said dont worry
about it but also to learn as much as you can  They accepted my mistake and
gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible  I have
read several posts of yours and have found them informative  Why dont you
give me the same chance
