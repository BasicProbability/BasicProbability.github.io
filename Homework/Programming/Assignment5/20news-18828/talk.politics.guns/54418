Avoid situations which encourage criminals Then you will
be as safe as possible Such as it is 

Really  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals  Id
really like to know  Would you say prohibit female college
students from riding their bicycles near the university during the
daytime  

Sounds a bit drastic doesnt it  Especially when the university is
locatd in a nice residential area  A friend of mine was attacked and
nearly raped in just this situation  The police didnt feel she was
in a situation which encouraged criminals

What do you think  Should we just tell her that it was her fault
for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day  That she
didnt avoid a situation that encouraged criminals  If thats the
case then wed all better put bars on our doors and windows and
pray for a police state to keep us all safe  Crime happens in all
situations  there are no defined areas that criminals avoid
