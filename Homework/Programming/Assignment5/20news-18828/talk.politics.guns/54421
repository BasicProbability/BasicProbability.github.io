Why didnt they release the children weeks ago

It would have been inconsistent behavior for them to have done so

Some people believe that there is more to life than the physical requirements

These folks believed that the generallyheld standards of the surrounding
community heck most of the world were morally wrong and letting the
children be abandoned to this godlessunbelieving culture would be condeming
them to eternal loss and separation from God

By their standards letting the children go would be abandoning them to a fate
literally worse than death

The FBI and BATF and media people working on the issue I suspect
just couldnt get their heads into a similarenough to say nothing of
identical mode of thinking to realize what they were doing

Physically there was no reason why the BDs shouldnt have given up and come
out a long time ago

From the point of view of the BDs they were up against the wall and had nowhere
to go at all

They apparently really did love their kids too much to abandon them to a godless
bunch of outsidersalthough the end result was horribly twisted

I didnt say the BDs were right I just said that thats the way they perceived
it

Koresh was a nutcase and a bunch of other people paid for that

And the FBI and BATF miscalculated and misunderstood what was going on from the
word go

Very likely possible  Reminds me of the movie The Rapture
