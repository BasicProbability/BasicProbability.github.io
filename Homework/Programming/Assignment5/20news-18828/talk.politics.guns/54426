Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who is
next  The Mormons or Jews

The Koreshians rubbed themselves out  Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene so Im not particularly
concerned  Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also


Lets see if I have this straight  A law is created that says you can not
have a automatic weapon and therefore its ok for the government to use
any level of force to enforce that law  Doesnt matter if the entire 
population of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed

Do I read you correctly
