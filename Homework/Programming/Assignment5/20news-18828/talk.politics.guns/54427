  As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
  in Texas 

 Do YOU eat all your food cold

 Ever hear of electric ovens or microwaves  Very popular
 Electric stoves outside metroareas especially

And they work especially well when the Feds have cut off your utilities
