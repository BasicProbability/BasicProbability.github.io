  napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it
                        
  As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm  
day  
  in Texas 
 
 Do YOU eat all your food cold
 
 Ever hear of electric ovens or microwaves  Very popular
 Electric stoves outside metroareas especially

Brent shows his ignorance once again  Power had been cut for weeks  And hes  
never lived in a rural area if he thinks electric stoves have favor there   
They stop working when the power fails and power restoration come MUCH slower  
in the country than the city  LP gas stoves and ovens are very much prefered  
 
  
  Personal opinions Why  
   BRENT IRVINE   yes  What did you think  irvineuxhcsouiucedu  
  they were
