 And I suppose the FBI also prevented them from coming out with their 
 hands up while national tv cameras watch
 
 Watch from where  Two miles away  Far enough away that whatever
 really happenned must be explained through the vengeful filter of
 a humiliated agency that said quote Enough is enough
 
 Please tell me what you think would have happened had the people 
 come out with their hands up several weeks ago
 
It didnt happen

 scenario that is simplest and most plausible  I do not generally 
 believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely 
 scenarios
 
 The FBI sent letters to Martin Luther Kings wife insinuating
 that MLK was having an affair  Again please tell us exactly
 how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government
 
 More than someone who would not release children from the compound
 
Obviously  You are an authority worshiper

 I saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in 
 1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult
 

Give me a camera and time with you and I can present excerpts that show you  
to be a cult leader  Guarenteed You should at least view the whole  
documentary before you claim it as a source


 I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair  I think they 
 bungled it badly from the start  But I dont think they are 
 responsible for the fire which started in two different places
 

Two places eh  You saw this  Or did the wonderful FBI tell you this  
I saw one place

 The BATF is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair
 But to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is 
 ludicrous
 
 I suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to
 risk small arms fire to get some good footage  These people
 were told to get the hell out of camera range  Why
 

Couldnt answer this one eh  This is the most important question of all it  
is the root cause of all the other suspicion
