Along the lines of The Armed Citizen heres a story that
some of you may find amusing  Its a story about Arizona
househunting from Leslie Fish musician and author


      One of the reasons Im planning to move to Arizona is that 
despite its lousy economy 4way race problems simmering religious
problems and hopelessly bad government  Arizona has one of the lowest
violent crime rates in the country Is it just coincidence that
Arizona is also one of the few remaining nogun control states in the
country

    Well consider this funny story Last time I was in Phoenix
staying with Liz Burnham I did some checking on the local realestate
market thats when I discovered that with my income  as provable by
my tax returns  I can qualify for every lowincome housing loan in
the book with the exception of VA and I came across an astonishing
ad in the local marketpaper It offered a threebedroom house in the
Phoenix area for  are you ready for this  all of 10000 No money
down 100 per month total payments Christ on a HarleyDavidson I
called up the realestate office making this offer made it clear that
I was only checking the local market and asked about that house Were
the walls roof and foundation structurally sound Yes Were the
plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code Yes Did the
airconditioning system an absolute necessity in Phoenix work  Yes
again  Okay so what was wrong with the house  Well it needed lots
of plastering painting yard work and some patching of the roof 
and yes lowinterest repair loans were available  Okay sez I If
thats all thats wrong with it just why are you selling a 3bedroom
house for all of 10000 Well squirms the agent its in kind of a
bad neighborhood How bad sez I remembering some of the neighborhoods
Ive seen in Chicago and Oakland  Worst in the city the agent sighs
and then he told me this amazing story

    Every few years it seems the big vicegangs in Los Angeles notice
that theres no gang presence in Phoenix  which is just a quick
5hour drive from LA  and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary
there Well a couple years ago the colonizing force came to this
neighborhood  it being poor and Spanish they figured they could move
right in and take over  bought this house and started operations
Unfortunately for them the neighbors not only didnt like this  they
didnt care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night
pimps soliciting their kids dope deals on the corners in broad
daylight and so on  they werent afraid to do something about it
The neighbors called the cops for some reason the Phoenix police are
remarkably honest capable polite and prompt and the cops promptly
came and swept up all the whores pimps and pushers off the street and
away to jail The remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the
fashion they usually use in LA they got the complainants name and
address off the court records and did a driveby shooting at his
house  Well this wasnt Los Angeles The moment the neighbors heard
the first gunshots fired they all ran out their front doors with their
own guns  rifles shotguns pistols everything  and shot back

    The car didnt make it to the end of the block It coasted to a
stop riddled with more holes than the famous Bonnie and Clyde getaway
car which Ive seen its on display in a casino in a casino in Las
Vegas  The gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured so the car
caught fire The neighbors waited a good 15 minutes  making sure
nobody got out of that car  before they called the fire department to
come put out the fire and tow the wreck away By that time the asphalt
under the car had melted and caught fire too which subsequently left a
large and nasty pothole in the street The city is slow about
repairing small streets so the hole stayed there providing a traffic
hazard for several months All this was two years ago the agent
concluded and theres been no trouble since but the house and the
neighborhood still have a bad reputation  and thats why the house
was so cheap

    Hearing this story I nearly laughed my ass off I told the agent
that if I had the money at the moment Id bygod buy the house this
was nothing compared to bad neighborhoods Id seen here in
California where driveby shootings go unchecked by the wellarmed
cops let alone by the unarmed neighbors If thats the absolute worst
youll find in Phoenix then thats the city for me

    Thats the difference that an armed civilian population makes
Think about it
