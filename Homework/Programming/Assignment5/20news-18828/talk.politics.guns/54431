Subject Re Whos next  Mormons and Jews

In article 1r24bvdifapplecom earlwapplecom Earl Wallace writes

 The Koreshians rubbed themselves out  Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
 propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene so Im not particularly
 concerned  Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also
 

It is silly to make this statement  Fifteen minutes after the fire
started the official word out of FBI  headquaters in DC was
that the DVs committed suicide  It would seem logical that the
lantern story has more credibility  You cant even to pretend to
know for sure what happened although Clinton is doing just that
