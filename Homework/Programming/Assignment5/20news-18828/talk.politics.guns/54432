What does this censored from NORWAY think hes doing telling us
how to run the place  I wanna know somebody please splain

Guess how NORWAY survived the Third Reich  Give you a hint
it wasnt by passive resistance the way the Danes did it

I believe it had something to do with a politician whose name isnt
exactly the most complimentary word nowadaysone Vidkun Quisling
We all know what a quisling is right  Im sure everyone can come up
with a few examples right about now
