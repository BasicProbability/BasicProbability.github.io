A poster claims he always asks antigunners what they think would
be reasonable personal firepower restrictions OK then 

Caliber  Not greater than 32
Muzzle   Not greater than 300 ftlbs with any combo of bullet wtvel
Action   Single shot rifles and single action revolvers 
          Revolvers bearing no more than six rounds and incorporating
          an antifanning mechanism to discourage Roy Rogers wannabes
Bullets  Any nonexplosive variety HPs just fine

Now  these specs leave the 32 HR magnum as about the most powerful
allowable civie cartridge for handgun or rifle use It would be
reasonably effective against home intruders muggers rabid wolves
and other such nasties even with the firearmtype limitations At the
same time this caliberpower limit would reduce the ultimate lethality
of hits

I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical
assault weapon  You are wrong  Compared to what most criminals use a
9mm with military ammo FMJs or a military rifle use is extremely
rare 223 or 762mm with military ammo FMJs the 32 HR magnum with
civie bullets is more lethal  Most of the arms which criminals and
the military use are among the least lethal arms in existance

What if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen
alone  It hasnt been tried in recient times but it might work
