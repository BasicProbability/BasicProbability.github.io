Subject Is it really apples to apples  Lawful vs unlawful use of guns
From kim39scws8harvardedu John Kim

I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective 
selfdefense but something strikes me as odd among the
proRKBA arguments presented here

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands indeed even a
million of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
criminal activity seem valid to me  Likewise the number
of guncaused homicides each year about 11000year  However
it is surprising that the Evil AntiGun Empire  Darth Vader
breathing sound effect here never tries to compare
All legitimate gun defenses vs All gun crimes  Instead 
its always All legitimate gun defenses  which includes
cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed and
cases in which the criminal is not here vs just 
criminal gun homicides which only includes case sin which
the victim died

Why is this  Of course it wouldnt be unreasonable to say
that in each crime already measured involving guns the
consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
a gunbased bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
into a gunbasd robberyhomicide  Whereas in the legitimate
gun defenses one may assume that all those criminals who
were deterred would have committed more crime or more
serious crimes had they not been deterred
