MWHaving such gun laws on the books is still better than nothing
MWWhat would the DA have traded away in order to get the guilty plea if the
MWgun law had not been in effect

Our liberty

Rightdont even think about enforcing the law and imposing the prescribed
penaltylets hose the citizens instead

  OLX 22  Madness takes its toll  please have exact change
