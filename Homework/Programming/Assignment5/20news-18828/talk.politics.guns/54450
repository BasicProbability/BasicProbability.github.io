Note that Bo Gritz was on the Populist party ticket with David
Duke for veep in 1988 until he found out that Duke was leading
he ticket when he withdrew his candidacy  So Gritz gave up his
chance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting
Duke

Id hardly call that giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US
the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil  Still
it does imply that he doesnt want to be associated with Duke
