 I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective 
 selfdefense but something strikes me as odd among the
 proRKBA arguments presented here
 
 The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands indeed even a
 million of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
 criminal activity seem valid to me  Likewise the number
 of guncaused homicides each year about 11000year  However
 it is surprising that the Evil AntiGun Empire  Darth Vader
 breathing sound effect here never tries to compare
 All legitimate gun defenses vs All gun crimes  Instead 
 its always All legitimate gun defenses  which includes
 cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed and
 cases in which the criminal is not here vs just 
 criminal gun homicides which only includes case sin which
 the victim died
 
 Why is this  Of course it wouldnt be unreasonable to say
 that in each crime already measured involving guns the
 consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
 a gunbased bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
 into a gunbasd robberyhomicide  Whereas in the legitimate
 gun defenses one may assume that all those criminals who
 were deterred would have committed more crime or more
 serious crimes had they not been deterred

I think its an attempt to show livessaved v liveslost all other
 gun related crimes dont result in liveslost  On the other hand
 its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses 
 prevented lives from being lost  In other words the liveslost
 is pretty clear its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter
 number while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful 
 self defenses  Clearly that percentage doesnt have to be real 
 high to show that livessaved  liveslost

As a semirelated point check out Klecks Point Blank  I believe
 it goes into some related areas it also is well written and informative
