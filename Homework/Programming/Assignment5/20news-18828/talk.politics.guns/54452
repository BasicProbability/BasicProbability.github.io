I dont know about animal attacks but there are 23500 murders
each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest If only
21 of the murders were killings by wackos you would be
wrong Worse there are also 102500 rapes and 1055000 aggravated
assaults each year These numbers make violent attacks and
preventing them thousands of times more significant than the
accidents you are worried about
 
 These stats are invalid were talking BACKCOUNTRY These stats for
 rapesassaultsdeaths do not represent the backcountry singularly the
 great majority represent urban incidents You should have pointed this out
