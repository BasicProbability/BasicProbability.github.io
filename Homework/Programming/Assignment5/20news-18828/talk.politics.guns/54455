 THE ARMED CITIZEN
 
 Mere presence of a firearm without a shot being fired prevents
 crime in many instances as shown by news reports sent to The
 Armed Citizen  
 
 Perhaps so but note that of the accounts cited there was only
 one in which no shot was fired Of the other twelve five
 described cases in which the assailant was wounded by a shot
 and six described cases in which the assailant was killed by a
 shot

And had not these citizens accepted the moral responsibility to
protect their own lives there could well have been at least
13 innocent victims lying dead and several criminals still out 
walking the streets perpetrating their crimes on others
