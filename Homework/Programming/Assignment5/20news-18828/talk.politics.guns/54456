 As far as John Q Public with a gun the Supreme Court has already
 ruled in cases such as US v Miller 307 US 175 1939 and US v
 VerdugoUrquidez 110 S Ct 1839 1990 that that is EXACTLY what 
 the amendment protects  This interpretation can be found as far back
 as the Dred Scott case in 1857
 
 Its worth noting that US vs Miller sustained Millers conviction
 of possession of an illegal firearm noting that a sawedoff shotgun
 was not a proper militia weapon 

No they noted that no one had CLAIMED that it was a proper militia
weapon despite having been used in at least two wars  This was true
since neither Miller nor his lawyer appeared before the Court

Did they or did they not sustain Millers conviction I dont have the
text of the case handy 

Yes shotguns had been used in WWI the SpanishAmerican War and the
US Civil War That was not in question The possession of a sawedoff
shotgun was ie a weapon altered to improve concealibility

 Therefore US vs Miller supports limited government regulation of 
 firearms

Dont go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by 
the consequences that you find at the end of it  mainly that the
lawabiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia 
purpose from handguns to sawedoff shotguns and fully automatic weapons
That in fact is what this decision says

You are free to produce evidence that Im not willing to abide with
all the implications of this 

Just because I dont wholeheartedly endorse the NRA position does not
mean that I oppose the RKBA This attitude is what makes the NRA
unpopular
