IOWA  All firearm related bills are dead  Senate File 303
dealing with offduty police officers carrying concealed remains
viable

	The POWER of the word processor and a stamp at work
The fact that around here the state rep generally lives no more than
nine miles from any constituent doesnt hurt either

  ISU only censors what I read not what I say  Dont blame them  
     USENET Post to exotic distant machines  Meet exciting      
                 unusual people  And flame them                   


Does anyone know the particulars on the Senate File 303
Does this bill allow or deny offduty police from carrying concealed

From what information that I have Iowa has a discretionary permit policy
on CCW  If S 303 allows policeoffduty to carry concealed then I would
be inclined to oppose it  I dont believe offduty police officers should
have any more rights than civilians  If law or policy prevents lawabiding
citizens from being armed for self defense then why should offduty police
officer be treated any differently
