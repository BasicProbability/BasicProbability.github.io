I predict that the outcome of the study of what went wrong with the
Federal Assault in Waco will result in future assaults of that type
being conducted as fullscale military operations with explicit
shoottokill directives

You mean they arent already Could have fooled me


 
                            REMEMBER WACO
     Who will the government decide to murder next Maybe you
Opinions are mine I dont care if you blame the University or the State

Well it seems we dont learn the lessons of history do we

I was hoping that Kent State taught us a lesson

Apparently not

Apparently the government will murder anyone they choose to still
