 As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm day

Thank you for pointing out the obvious to people who so clearly missed it
I cant stand it when peoples first reaction is to defend the aggressor

Mr Tavares you have a unique and thoughtful way of getting to the heart
of the matter and I thank you for putting it to good use
