Hey gang its not about duck hunting or about dark alleys
its about blackclad helmeted and booted troops storming
houses and violating civil rights under color of law 

Are YOU ready to defend YOUR Constitution

Its also about crazy fatigue clad survivalist types blasting the 
snot out of people who accidentally stray onto his land in the
name of self defense

Well the count is now at least 86 dead by government action  How many
have been killed in the last year in the manner you described  What no
facts  Oh how silly of me I forgot you dont like guns so you dont
need no stinkin facts


Dont get too selfrighteous Mr guntoter

Dont get too smug Mr gunhater
