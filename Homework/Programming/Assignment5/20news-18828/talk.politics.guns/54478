 As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm 
 day in Texas 

Do YOU eat all your food cold

Ever hear of electric ovens or microwaves  Very popular
Electric stoves outside metroareas especially

Hey Einstein ever tried to use an electric stove or microwave WITHOUT
ELECTRICITY  Its been shut off for weeks now courtesy of your local FBI
assault squad

Now are you going to put your foot in your mouth or shall I get a crowbar
and assist you
