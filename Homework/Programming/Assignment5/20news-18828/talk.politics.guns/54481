Women stand up for your right to be just as stupid as men

Our new Attorney General seems determined to do so In the past
few days she has said

	She hopes the King beating will not reduce public confidince
	in law enforcement

	The tactics of using tear gas and driving tanks through
	walls in Waco were intended to further a peacefull solution
	to the crisis

	Those same tactics were intended to prevent a mass suicide
	but she never expected the sect to react by killing themselves

Its comforting to know at least that she wasnt Clintons first
choice
