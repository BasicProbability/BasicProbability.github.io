In article 1r1chuh22pandorasdsuedu chiuionoscmil Francis Chiu writes

    Initial assault on the compound  more like a wooden farm house if
  it burned to the ground like it did  for WHAT  Regardless of who
  startedcaused the fire NONE of this would have happened if the
  ATF can HONESTLY justify their initial assault and handled it 
  properly  

I just got through listening to the 10 oclock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
months of investigation for their raid 

I couldnt believe the junk on this list For example the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of 9mm and 223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles Imagine thatthey had ammunition  They also had
aluminum dust Yeah its a component of thermite but so far I havent
heard that its illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M79 grenade launcher Anybody know about this

Months of investigation For this 80 people died
