 If one reasons that the United States of America at one time represented 
 and protected freedom  individual liberty and personal responsibility  
 and I do in fact think that this is true and that totalitarianism  
 absolute government control and tyranny  represents freedoms opposite 
 which it does did the USA really win the cold war

Of course not  The USAs only hope is for Yelsen how ever you spell it to  
fail the referendum and have the hardliners take over again
