You didnt even get the capitalization correct  Try reading USCA on
the Constitution or get any other CORRECT version of the
Constitution 

This is REALLY STUPID nitpicking  Capitalization rules in the late 18th
century were quite different from today and what was posted matches current
capitalization rules

We also dont make s look like f and other such things done in the late
seventeen hundreds

In the original Constitution militia arms etc were capitalized simply
because they were nouns  This is also done currently in German  There is
no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized
The capitalization denotes no special emphasis
