Id like to point out that I was in error  Terminator began posting only 
six months before he purchased his first firearm according to private email
from him
I cant produce an archived posting of his earlier than January 1992
and he purchased his first firearm in March 1992
I guess it only seemed like years

I first read and consulted recguns in the summer of 1991  I
just purchased my first firearm in early March of this year

 NOt for lack of desire for a firearm you understand  I could 
have purchased a rifle or shotgun but didnt want one
