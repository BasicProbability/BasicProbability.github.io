	Well Josh I agree with you to some respectless your spelling
	errors  The Govmnt always must win even if they kill every
	man women and childby GOD they must win at all costs

	This happens over and over and over in this country  Lets make
	excuses get the worthless press to cover up everything let the
	officials take the heat for top management stupidity etcetc
