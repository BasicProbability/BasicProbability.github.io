Why thanks for your reply to my post  By the way I never never ever said 
that it was right to shoot THOSE kind of babies  However it was the Branch
Davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their savior 
yeah right budy boy because he had brainwashed them into believing that 
what ever he says is the truth even if means that they are to give up their
lives for HIS cause  Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATFs
who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out this was 50 days to many for me and
for many of the rest of the US  I am however sad to hear of the death of any 
child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am
