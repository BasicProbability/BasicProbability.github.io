Subject Re FBI Directors Statement on Waco Standoff

feustelnetcomcom David Feustel writes
We have NO evidence that BATF  FBI would not have started shooting
when and if people had started coming out of the burning building

Oh  How about the press  If the BATF  FBI were going to shoot people
leaving a burning building dont you think they would get rid of the
press first
