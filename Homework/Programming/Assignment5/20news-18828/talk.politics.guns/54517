 I just got through listening to the 10 oclock news on Channel 4 here in
 Dallas They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
 months of investigation for their raid 

CNN just claimed he bought 104 semiautomatic assault rifles  And
they say Koresh wasnt godlike  He managed to buy or build a
collection of fullyautomatic semiautomatic rifles  Quite a feat
I would say  

Theyre still making charges of sexual abuse and such or course
Nobody seems to have noticed that the Treasury department has nothing
to do with sex crimes  Or maybe the feds have recently instituted a
TAX on sex crimes  Yeah thats why the BATF was there looking for
unregistered guns this is my weapon this is my gun this is for
fighting this is for

 I couldnt believe the junk on this list For example the BDs were accused
 of stockpiling a bunch of 9mm and 223 ammunition that can be used in M15
 and M16 assault rifles Imagine thatthey had ammunition

I also heard that theyre claiming to be cautious because of Koreshs
heated ammunition stockpile  I seem to recall that smokeless powder
tends to decompose at even moderate temperatures  I would be rather
surprised after a fire of that nature if any of his stockpile is
unexploded or unburned

 They also had
 aluminum dust Yeah its a component of thermite but so far I havent
 heard that its illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
 furniture

I seem to recall that aluminum powder is a common component of
fireworks  The folks on recpyro could probably tell you

 The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
 illegal was an M79 grenade launcher Anybody know about this

I think anything is legal if you have the proper license  If he had
a curios and relics permit I believe he could legally own
handgrenades to go with his launcher
