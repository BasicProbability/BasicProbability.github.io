Just because someting was good once does not mean it will be forever

Yes gone are the days when you can leave your house unlocked at night
Well it couldnt last forever

	For the record it wasnt until I came to college excluding
the times I went to Omaha or Council Bluffs for something that I
ever removed the keys from the ignition of my car  Come to think of
it it was only after I moved to Ames Ia pop 45K that I ever took
to locking my doors at night

	Ive discovered that 50Kyear isnt worth living in fear
all day  I might just move back to the farm

	This weekend is Veishea  You know when ISU students riot
for no apparent reason  This year weve the Farm Aid concert
to add to the festivities  Anybody bet me theres another riot
Remember Iowa law has three guys talking loud defined as a riot
Stay tuned for an onthescene report this weekend
