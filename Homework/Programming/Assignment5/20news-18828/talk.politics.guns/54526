You believe that individuals should have the right to own weapons of
mass destruction  I find it hard to believe that you would support a 
neighbors right to keep nuclear weapons biological weapons and nerve
gas on hisher property  

	That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining
these weapons 

This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough  Good

and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of
modern practice five months or five centuries down the road  

I would hope so  Lets define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
whose majority of energy comes from fission andor fusion of atomic
nuclei  Lets define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
in such state quantity and with such a vector that they could cause 
death or serious disease further defined to a significant number of
people if released in a city similarly populated area resevoir or
cropland  


Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined  Other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry  Licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals

I am not a lawyer but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions

Ill give
you a little hint  see that manure pile in the farmers field down the
road  In the USA that is a weapon of mass destruction 

Nope  It is not considered a weapon

biological in
nature because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate
the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water  So
where do you draw the line  In the USA the EPA has ruled that
a pile of scrap iron is illegal  Care to draw a thinner line this time

It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction  Many things are
banned for other reasons
