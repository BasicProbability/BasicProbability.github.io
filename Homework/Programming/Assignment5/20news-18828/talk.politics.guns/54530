Subject American Horror File  call for help


Todays atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on
something Ive been thinking about for some time  Over the last few
years I have heard of one case after another of government running
completely amok  Unfortunately most people are oblivious of the
governments crimes and still think of it as their protector  So I
intend to put together what I call the American Horror File a
compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod
over the rights of its citizens over the last few years focusing
especially on deaths and injuries resulting from noknock warrants
and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws
but including any other cases for which I can find decent
documentation  I hope to make people bloodboiling arterybursting
redhot enraged at their government

The end result will probably be a book in electronic form ASCII text
and postscript files detailing the governments crimes of recent
years  This book will be distributed at cost and I will encourage
people to post copies to BBSs send copies on disk to friends and
print out copies and give them to neighbors

This is a call for your help  Any information that you can send me on
how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated  I would prefer
information that is welldocumented with sources given about specific
instances of governmental abuses  I also welcome anyone who wants to
join me in collecting and researching information for this project
