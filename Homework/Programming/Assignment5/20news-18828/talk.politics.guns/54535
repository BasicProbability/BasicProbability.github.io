The idea of the card is bull in and of its self but Im curious to know
do
they plan on making it a requirement to always have it on you or is it
only going to be required to be presented when trying to ge medical aid

This at least has already been determined The Blue Cross medical
coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future
national system To get emergency medical care anyone so insured
must always carry their Blue Cross card Before entering a hospital
you must notify Blue Cross or they will refuse to pay your bills
In an emergency where you must be treated before notifying them
you must inform them within 24 hours or if you are unable to do
so for medical reasons the hospital must Failing to do so within
24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization In you need
your card to notify them and without the card the hospital certainly
wouldnt know they had to Therefore you are required to carry
the card at all times or do without emergency medical coverage

 Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on
the
 head and your wallet with your insurance card is stolen  This happened to
 me and it took six months to sort the mess out  These sorts of plans sound
 nice at first but in the end they just create a lot of paperwork and
 bureaucracy to deal with all the checking and filing they involve

                               Tom the non hacker

Whoa  Have a care what you say Tom  The obvious answer to that problem
is to tatoo your National ID Number on you  say your forearm  so you
can never leave home without it  Hell it worked once before

And that brings us back to my original sarcasmladen post  wheres the
outcry from the liberal sector over the National ID Card  My God if some
conservative had proposed this  plus Clintons National Police proposal
 the liberals would be shrieking Sieg Heil and Police State

You selfstyled liberals ought to be ashamed of yourselves  Hypocrites

I dont know what you watch but I saw a spokesman for the ACLU voice
opposition to this idea on NBC the very first night
