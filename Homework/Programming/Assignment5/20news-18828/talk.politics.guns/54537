Subject Re WACO Clinton press conference part 1

I predict that the outcome of the study of what went wrong with the
Federal Assault in Waco will result in future assaults of that type
being conducted as fullscale military operations with explicit
shoottokill directives

Im beginning to look forward to reaching the 100 allocation of taxes
to pay for the interest on the national debt At that point the
federal government will be will go out of business for lack of funds
