 Kevin who agrees that David Koresh was probably a firstrate nutcase
        but who firmly believes that the Bill of Rights guaranteed his
        his right to be a religious fanatic and that the government is

        OK which small underrepresentedincongress religious group
        are we going to persecute next and are we going to torch their
        church with a rolled up copy of the Constitution
