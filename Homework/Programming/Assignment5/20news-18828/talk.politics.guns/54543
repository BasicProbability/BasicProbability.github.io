Subject Re The Dayton Gun Buy Back Re Boston Gun Buy Back

In article C5uCHuFFncbnewscbattcom lvccbnewscbattcom Larry Cipriani writes
According to WNCI 979 FM radio this morning Dayton Ohio is operating a
gun buy back  They are giving 50 for every functional gun turned in
They ran out of money in one day and are now passing out 50 vouchers of
some sort  They are looking for more funds to keep operating  Another
mediaevent brought to you by HCI

Is there something similar progun people can do   For example pay 100
to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm   Sounds a bit
tacky but hey whatever works

Here are a few ideas

1 a free library card so they can look up the FBI
   Uniform Crime Report which shows how good HCI is
   at lying through their teeth

2 a free RTD Transit Pass which will allow antigunners
   to tour South Central Los Angeles and convince
   people living there that they dont need guns to protect
   themselves because the police will do it for them 
   dont lose the pass youll need it to get out

3 a free bus ride to Vermont which has almost no gun
   control and curiously enough almost no crime either

4 a free calculator since antigunners have heretofore
   been unable to figure out what a small percentage of
   the guns owned in America are used to commit violent crime
