So a person who keeps a gun at home is 43 times more likely to die
at home from a gunshot than he or she is likely to kill an intruder

Sounds like apples n oranges to me

In any case has anybody tried to make the obvious counterstudy

What are the numbers for someone who does not keep a gun at home
That is what is the ratio of dyingathomefromagunshot to
killinganintruder for people who do NOT keep guns in their homes

So what are is the ratio of unarmed people shot to death in their
homes vs unarmed people who kill intruders  Is it worse than 6 to 1

Inquiring minds want to know

I dont know this specific ratio but I do have an earlier post that says
a gun is 33 times more likely to defend someone including the times where
the gun isnt fired just scares the perpetrator away than it is to kill
someone including self defense  The post is kind of long but Ill be
glad to dig it up and email it to anyone who asks
