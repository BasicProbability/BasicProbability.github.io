in his nappies and manages to splutter

	You know John if you had kept the followup to line here on talk
politics guns we might have taken you a bit more seriously  It would have
at least implied that you had some backbone perhaps a modicum of willingness
to present your views and support them  I guess we all know better now

People dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says hes
jesus deserve all they get

	Really  Thats interesting as I was always of the opinion that
people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax
funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that
they get  Dunkirk for example  What  That has nothing to do with it
Then enjoy your helping of foot

Anyway he killed a few feds

	And they killed a few people of their own including one child
at last report  So what  Being a federal agent is not license to kill
Then theres CNN indicating that the ATFFBI actually DID start the
fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people  If youre
so hot to assign blame make sure you dont overlook the obvious

Hes not the goddam hero here

	Montgomery isnt much of a hero here either  Amazing how
different things look on the other side of the pond isnt it  Not
that what you think makes much of a difference in the USA though and
for good reason  When you can vote Ill take your rhetoric a bit more
seriously  Right now youre merely a waste of transatlantic bandwidth

Hes dead an im happy

	Proof positive that ignorance really is bliss
