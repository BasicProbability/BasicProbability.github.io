Wrong  there are people who can legally carry concealed in IL and
there are circumstances under which MANY people can carry concealed

Is accuracy really too much to expect

As I said before no it isnt  In another post I referred to the Illinois
statutes and how I looked up the law for concealed carry   I will type in the
complete law and post later  but I would like to prove that I was correct using
accurate information so I will put sections down here now

Good  now lets look at those sections  Theyll prove my point

     a  A person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he
knowingly

4  Carries or possesses in any vehicle or CONCEALED on or about his person
     except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business
     any pistol revolver stun gun or taser or other firearm

Note that this doesnt affect all concealed carry  Look after the
word except  It always helps to read the law before commenting on
it

Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed  How about someone at
home  Note that both are legal and a lot of common people qualify
for one or the other
