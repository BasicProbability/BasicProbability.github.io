I dont remember the figures EXACTLY but there were about 3500 deaths in Texas
in 1991 that was caused by guns
This is more than those beeing killed in carACCIDENTS
Yes there could be that low sentences or high poverty could influence the
figures but theyre still pretty high right
I also believe Texas has some of the most liberal gunlaws in USA

And youd be wrong about that too

Note that Texas isnt unique in this more withgun deaths than
withcar deaths but some of the other states where it happens have
extremely strict gun laws  Oops  so much for the meaning

It isnt clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car
accidents are unintentional while gun deaths arent but if were
going to make it lets at least be honest

I should not suffer because of others
We all agree on this one BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor
well have to give up SOME of our freedom Note the 

Give it up for what  Gun control doesnt have any benefits so
it fails by this standard

Do you have an insurance
Then youll have to pay because of what others do

Note that insurance gives me something in return  gun control doesnt

What the hell is he trying to say 
When you live in a society USA are stilll counted as one you
have to saccrifice
The question is HOW MUCH

Thats half the question  the rest is and what do you get for your
sacrifice  If the answer to the second question is nothing as it
is for gun control then we dont have to ask the first question
because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified
