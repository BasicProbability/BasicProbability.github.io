 Anybody got Arlen Spectres address  I want to write to him and thank him
 for showing the leadership to demand a Congressional investigation
 into the Waco mess

 	You are talking about the man who as a federal attorney did so
 much to frustrate the proper investigation of the JFK assassination by
 the House subcommittee on assassinations  Fox and hen house
 
Please note that my above comment was not intended as a flame of Kens
call for Congressional leadership to conduct a proper investigation
It was merely to call attention to the hazard of having Specter involved
If anyone took it that way I apologize

 fgautjwccsvaxsfasuedu    matter at all what actually happened
     Remember the Alamo         Truth is what the government chooses to 
       Remember Waco            tell you  Justice is what it wants to happen
