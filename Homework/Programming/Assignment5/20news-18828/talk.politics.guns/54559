I want to get involved in the fight to save our gun rights  But first I need
to get a little more educated  Ive been reading all the magzines and books I
can get my hands on and sifting through hundreds of messages here in the 
Internet

Can anyone tell me howwhere to obtain this info  Surely there has to be a
way to obtain copies of antigun legislation from those s in Washington

The House Document Room can be reached at 1 202 225 3456  You need to 
have the number of the document you want eg HR1036 and theyll be happy
to send it to you  Tell them if its going to be a big stack because the
surly sounding guy who answers is scrawling in a really awful hand on the
back of the envelope that will come and will run out of room quickly if
you dont tell him

The Senate document room is too important to deal with the likes of you
and I and will answer requests from off the hill only by mail
