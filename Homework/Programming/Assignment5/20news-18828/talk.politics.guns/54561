Increased Beverage Access SIBA writes


Oh Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places
In particular three different places where there were no APVs


Well I only saw it start in one place  A tank punched a hole in a wall
and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that
a 30 mph wind was blowing  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday and
fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made  A terrible negligent
accident


And if the government did start the fire then why werent people trying
to get out of the compound


Maybe they couldnt  Ive often marvelled at how people could get burned alive
in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire but it happens all the time
What if they were in sealed rooms trying to avoid the gas and didnt know
about the fire until it surrounded them  Remember the Israelis hiding in
sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gasbearing Scuds

Cripes Mark are you REALLY a college student  Maybe you ought to stop
worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head
Ever heard of questioning authority 

And besides oh I dont know why Im even bothering


OK Ill buy that  You do seem totally clueless


I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
a murderous heavilyarmed religious cult despite much evidence to the
contrary 

Wellllll  They werent murderous  Theyd never harmed or even threatened 
anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons
and hardware  And as far as evidence what are you talking about  
Everything the Feds have said theyve retracted practically as soon as they get
questioned in detail about it  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage
Access buddies sitting around the bar slurring stuff like they shoulda
killed em all 51 days ago dont feel that way but then youre probably
one of those people still saying about Klinton Give the guy a chance we dont
even know what hes gonna do Burp


Thought Experiment Suppose this exact same thing happened under
the Bush administration What would your answer be then Would you still
prefer to believe the cultists

No I dont really expect a response to that challenge

No problem you dont have any questions that scare any of us  Most of our
minds are apparently more developed than yours  

The answer is  YES  In a fcking heartbeat  

Thought Experiment  Would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth 
open blissfully sucking up anything the Feds said if Bush were the president
What no comeback  OK go ahead say it  Read my lips no new taxes P   


But then
again that is how Mr Clinton was elected by people who believe that
his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office

Um isnt that how all politicians are elected

Not in such a great degree  Bush broke one promise maybe two taxesguns
and we held him accountable for it  Of course it took him the better part of
4 years to do it  Slicks only been in office 101 days and hes broken lots
of them  Anddd  I imagine hell also be held accountable for that

I can just see the campaign buttons now   ABC  Anybody But Clinton

So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
people Are they like just plain evil or what Did they just wake up
one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the United States
to figure out who to oppress that day Im eager to know

Hmmm Apparently you just got here  Nobodys claiming that it was anything
but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally
dont get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up  And as far as how they picked
the Davidians who knows  Maybe they figured that nobodyd care about such
a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie
Maybe they figured theyd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs
during their religious services which was the reason the Feds gave for the
timing of the raid rather than running into resistance  Maybe they KNEW
that the BDs werent ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds spin doctors are
trying to tell the public  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing
on the Crips and Bloods  Maybe it was because the ATFs budget is up for
approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is
the case  Of course their reasoning doesnt matter only what they did
and this time people are just paying more attention to it


And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader 

Not if you mean that stupid dont stop thinking about tomorrow

How is he on diabolical laughter 

All Ive ever heard is Hillarys diabolical giggle  Waffle Man seems to have
lost his sense of humor

Does he look good in a cape 

Dont know never seen him in one  He probably looks fat and puffy faced
just like in a suit  I saw him in the Rose Garden the other day and I
couldnt get over how much he is starting to look like Teddy Kennedy


These things MUST be investigated You first


Dont worry these things WILL be investigated  Now go back to your beer
you dimwit



  
  Ive heard a lot of people compare Bill Clinton to Jimmy Carter and   
  Id like to go on record as saying that I dont think that its fair  
  Jimmy Carter was a veteran and he had personal character  And even   
  though I cant agree with Carters policies I always believed that    
  he was telling the truth as best he understood it  I cant say       
  that for the Fat Cat
