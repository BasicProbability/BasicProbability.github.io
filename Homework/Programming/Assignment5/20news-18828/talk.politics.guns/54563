Subject Latest on Texas HB 1776 CCW


I called the Texas bill tracking people 8002539693 again today 
regarding HB 1776  Concealed Carry  Well it was supposed to come
up for a vote this past Wednesday but the bill got sent back to
the Public Safety Committee  The PSC gave it a favorable rating
AGAIN and the bill must now be scheduled for debate by
the Calendars Committee AGAIN
