re is John Q Public with a gun protected

  Its worth noting that US vs Miller sustained Millers conviction
  of possession of an illegal firearm noting that a sawedoff shotgun
  was not a proper militia weapon 

 No they noted that no one had CLAIMED that it was a proper militia
 weapon despite having been used in at least two wars  This was true
 since neither Miller nor his lawyer appeared before the Court

 Did they or did they not sustain Millers conviction I dont have the
 text of the case handy 

Miller was convicted of owning a sawedoff shotgun and not paying the
NFA 34 tax  Snatches of the courts decision

The Second Amendment was intended to assure the continuation and render 
possible the effectiveness of such a force the militia It must be 
interpreted and applied with that end in view

The militia includes all males physically capable of acting in concert 
for the common defense

However regarding sawedoff shotguns certainly it is not within 
judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military 
equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense

Judicial notice is the term of art here  it meant that no such
evidence had been formally presented  This is different from claiming
that they had ruled that it wasnt

 Yes shotguns had been used in WWI the SpanishAmerican War and the
 US Civil War That was not in question The possession of a sawedoff
 shotgun was ie a weapon altered to improve concealibility

Im not talking about plain shotguns in war  Im talking about short
barrelled sawedoff shotguns in war

Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses luparas in the SpanishAmerican 
War and trenchcleaners in WW I  They were also put to good use by
US soldiers in WW II not to mention being invaluable to tunnel rats 
in Vietnam but of course Miller took place in 1939

  Therefore US vs Miller supports limited government regulation of 
  firearms
 
 Dont go arguing down this road unless you are willing to abide by 
 the consequences that you find at the end of it  mainly that the
 lawabiding common man has a right to own any weapon that has a militia 
 purpose from handguns to sawedoff shotguns and fully automatic weapons
 That in fact is what this decision says
 
 You are free to produce evidence that Im not willing to abide with
 all the implications of this 

Here is my quandary  you seem to be arguing that certain types of 
guns fall outside the scope of the Second  This isnt a useful argument 
unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs
in that class  

I think we both agree that zip guns probably arent protected  Maybe 
we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments 
have been banning or trying to ban because they have no sporting purpose 
and no provate citizen would ever need these guns DO fall under the 
protection of the Second  

So given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at 
some time been used by the military even if only for marksmanship 
training purposes I need to understand why you are intent on pressing 
this point arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second

 Just because I dont wholeheartedly endorse the NRA position does not
 mean that I oppose the RKBA This attitude is what makes the NRA
 unpopular

Often what makes someone unpopular is what other people say about him
How much did any of us fear or abhor the Branch Davidians six months ago
How many of us feared or abhorred Saddam Hussein five years ago
