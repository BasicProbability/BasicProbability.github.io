Note that Bo Gritz was on the Populist party ticket with David
Duke for veep in 1988 until he found out that Duke was leading
he ticket when he withdrew his candidacy  

Thats a revisionist account of what happened  Gritz was wellaware
of Dukes presence on the ticket  Given that Gritz is not at all shy
about associating and promoting other white supremacists such as the
Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto whatever reasons Gritz
had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Dukes presence

So Gritz gave up his
chance to be Vice President of the US just to aviod supporting
Duke

Id hardly call that giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US
the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil  Still
it does imply that he doesnt want to be associated with Duke

I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with
a photo of Gritz happily shaking hands with Duke
