 I cant speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in
 our society and government one can see the relentless movement toward
 one world government  The fact that the media demeans such charished 
 values as patriotism nationalism and protectionism are some of the
 cluesOur porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that 
 we have already lost a great deal of sovergnty

and Im sure that people who were big fans of fuedalism pissed and
moaned about the emergence of the modern nationstate Imagine the King
allowing serfs their freedom if they could live in the city for a year
Times change technology changes viable forms of social organization
change While concerns about preserving Western notions of civil liberties
in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one its
a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide Its much smarter to focus
on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are
acceptable than it iss to lament the passing of the old forms
