 Perhaps youve been under a rock the last few days  The BATF and the FBI
 are both federal agencies  Clinton has admitted in front of news cameras
 that Janet Reno the once and future Attorney General gave him a full
 briefing of what was planned before they did it and he gave her the
 go ahead
 
 Maybe just possibly that makes him a teensy bit responsible

Perhaps youve been under a rock since say the turn of the century How
in the  is one man supposed to review every single freaking
governmental action every day Thats why we have an executive branch HE
reviewed the plan and said go but he wasnt the architect and he wasnt
there bullhorn in hand implementing it Yes he was responsible in the
sense that he was briefed So what Shit happens That sounds like a
callous way to dismiss the deaths of 90 people but I cant understand why
people get so bent about the accidental deathsuicide which is it could
take months of some total fucking sociopathchild molester and his
crazed followers while opposing US intervention in Bosnia Just like
Billy boy said I think some of you people have too much time on your
hands and screwed up priorities

Just my HO
