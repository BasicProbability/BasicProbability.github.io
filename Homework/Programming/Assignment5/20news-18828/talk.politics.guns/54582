 Ive yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambells soup
 and M16sAR15s and bangingmarrying thirteen yuear olds Youre a sorry
 son of a bitch if you cant draw a distinction between these two things
 People like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
 who arent deserved of it Get a life and chill on the paranoia

  I am not a paranoid nor a government toady nor even am I the guy you were
talking to originally but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION

  A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not
that wierd in Texas  My own family very quiet taxpayers with extremely con
ventional views has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a twoperson
home  Some of them were mine but I dont live there anymore  I now have
my own shotgun in my apartment

  Texas Child Protective Services which loves to find child abuse found no
I repeat NO evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD and is saying
that they see none in any of the kids who were released  There is no evidence
that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives

  It is not against the law to stockpile most weapons or campbells soup  
Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware as I write this
to prove the BD really had any proscribed weapons

  I feel they were all loonies but there is no indication that they ever 
bothered anyone  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons
and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasnt
got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway 
If there was any real danger of the BDs going out on a rampage then that
is up to the officers of the state of Texas who are probably getting a per
verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something
in their state
