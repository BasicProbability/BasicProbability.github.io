	If the FBI started the fire why didnt people flee the
burning building

Could be a lot of reasons James  We wont know until the survivors are
allowed to speak for themselves rather than through an FBI spokesman

Some of the survivors have been interviewed on TV as they were going
to or returning from court They basically said no way was there any
kind of suicide pact or attempt

 
 Remember the Texas holocaust
