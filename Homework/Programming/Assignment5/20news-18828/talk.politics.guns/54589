  Kinda reminds you of the BDs doesnt it

 Go to hell Im no government  following fanatic Your sweeping
 generalizations evince your own ignorance What were they supposed to do
 Just let him be 

Yes  Given the history of the BDs and the fact that they were just 
peacefully minding their own business I think this would have been
the correct course of action in the very beginning  Everything that
followed was a direct result of the major media fuckup that the BATF
perpetrated just over 51 days ago

Fuck him Fuck the ATF too They shouldve done it right
 the first time

Yep no doubt about it  They should have just bombed those kooks
right from the gitgo  Yeah sure  So much for any resemblence
to an America that abides by the Constitution  So much for feeling
safe in your home  So much for any of the rights enumerated in the
Bill of Rights being upheld  Why bother  They just get in the way
of an effective government  That is a government of the elite by
the elite for the elite  

Joe attitudes like yours frighten me  You have very few facts about
what actually happened and what information you do have came from a 
single source the FBIBATF  Yet you are more than happy to pronounce
the BDs guiltyascharged based on this onesided testimony  Scary
