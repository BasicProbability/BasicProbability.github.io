 burning building
 
 Okay James tell you what Ill but you in a building with 90 other
 people  Ill put you in a highly tense situation  Ill subject you to
 sleep deprivation remove your utilities march tanks back in forth in
 front of you play recordings of tortured rabbits at high volume shine
 bright lights in your windows threaten to attack you at any time and cut
 you off from the outside world all for weeks at a time  Then Ill begin
 to smash in the building youre in destroying passages and stairs and
 spreading debris everywhere  At the same time Ill pump in massive
 quantities of nasty tear gas for six hours  

STOP IT ENOUGH Im out of there  I mean Im a relatively sane person 
God knows Im weak and will forgive me  But Im not stupid enough to stay in
this place any longer  I WANT OUT

Youll be holed up in a small
 area with 90 sweaty people on a hot day  Then the building will fill with
 smoke and become a inferno  90 people in a small room will try to leave
 with you  And Jim if you dont make it out wont you agree that it must
 be because you wanted to die
 
 Besides nine people did successfully flee the fire

Yeah and at least one person ran back in SOunds like a personal choice to me
Religious fanaticsm and a beleive that dying in the defense of your beliefs
is probably at the core of what happened in Waco We in the west tend to
disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups
who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefsconvictions I suspect that
this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs BUt well probably never
know
