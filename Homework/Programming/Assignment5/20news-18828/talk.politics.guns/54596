Did anyone notice that Clinton was smiling and making jokes just before
this press conference Considering the number of people killed this 
seems very inappropriate to me


Or did anyone notice that when Clinton referred to the Davidians as
religious fanatics that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from
the reporters  

To me this was not only in poor taste but it showed the medias bias and
hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe  No wonder they
have been cheerleading for the kgBATF and the FBI during this whole affair

It collectivism vs individualism is an ancient conflict Men have come
close to the truth but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell
after another Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy The
savages whole existence is public ruled by the laws of his tribe
Civilization is the process of setting man free from men

I dont speak for my company We hire the Politically Correct to do that
