Id appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions

The Brady Bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to
it in Congress  Did Bush veto it  If so when
 
       The Brady Bill passed the House in 1992 but failed to reach a
vote in the Senate  As such it never reached Bush  Sarah Bradys
condemnation notwithstanding

I have a joint HouseSenate conference committe report ie crime bill
for the 102rd Congress which contains a Brady Bill  7 day waiting period
within it  I believe it just died and never came up for a vote in either
house

       Itll probably pass the House again and will probably pass the
Senate if they can get it to a vote  Whether of not theyll be busy
with other things will be the question

They got four years of Clintons support to pass it
