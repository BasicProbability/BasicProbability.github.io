For me though the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
how fast the fire spread ponted to someone dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or firestarter

Just from experience seeing a couple of houses burn down one doesnt
need any accelerant to get a lot of black soot  Theres plenty of
stuff in a house that will burn dirty  Even the asphalt shingles
would make a really sooty smoke
