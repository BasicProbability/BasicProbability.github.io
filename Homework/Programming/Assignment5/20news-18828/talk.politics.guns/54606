   Im sure such weapons have been developed  Our society does not
   however condone their possession or use  

Actually Joe I wrote the above  Peter was responding to my article

Im actually rather confused by your post  I suppose I didnt
make myself clear cause you seem to have gotten exactly the
opposite impression from what I intended  I suppose the authorities
might have been a better term than society  Carry and use a firearm
in many parts of the country certainly the parts I live in and expect
at the very least to have an awful lot of explaining to do
And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that
actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves

   In a few other parts of our society handguns are banned or
   so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law
   abiding citizen for selfdefense outside the home  Funny 
   though how the criminals in such places continue to have a 
   lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them  
   IMHO you dont need to be either a political philosopher or 
   a crime victim to realize that theres a flaw in the gun
   grabbers logic  

Agreed

   Youre welcome to your HO too the First Amendment being as 
   important as the Second but please dont let your obvious 
   good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities 
   about something as big and diverse as US society

My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable
weapons of self defense doesnt mean youll escape a whole shitload
of trouble should you be forced to use them

   Or by the
   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause 
   to someone who would be a criminal anyway

I made no such statements nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook  
   
   Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself
   if others thoughts are not that kindly

Thats all I want the opportunity to leave in peace or to 
have the means to defend myself when that in not possible

I think we agree on this issue  I guess my position didnt
survive the transition from cognition to ASCII
