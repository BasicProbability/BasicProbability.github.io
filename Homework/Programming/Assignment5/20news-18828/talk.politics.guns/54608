 worth posting again 
Hey gang its not about duck hunting or about dark alleys
its about blackclad helmeted and booted troops storming
houses and violating civil rights under color of law 

Are YOU ready to defend YOUR Constitution

Its also about crazy fatigue clad survivalist types blasting the 
snot out of people who accidentally stray onto his land in the
name of self defense

Dont get too selfrighteous Mr guntoter

Aint got a pair of fatigues and I dont blast people wandering aimlessly
I ask them what theyre doing there I only blast people who display
obvious violent intent like blackclad men with weapons climbing thru
secondstory windows or people who break down the door instead of knocking
Or people who knock my house down with tanks and set it afire  Sound 
familiar yet

Riddle me this Why the hell are the CONVICTED CRIMINALS in Ohio getting
the kid glove treatment and the BDs are burned alive without a trial
Put aside who started the blaze I still think any decent shyster can 
make a case for cruel and unusual punishment playing the sounds of
tortured rabbits over the loudspeakers wheres the SPCA in all this

Oh and thats Mister guntoter SIR to you bucko  Just because you choose
to abandon your rights leave mine the hell alone thankyouverymuch
