 I have not made up my mind about Waco but there sure seems to be a group of  
 devoted government following fanatics willing to believe whatever that  
 government wants to tell them without any shred of doubt nor thought of thier
 own  They sure get shrill whenever their belief structure is being shaken
 
 Kinda reminds you of the BDs doesnt it
 
 Jim

Go to hell Im no government  following fanatic Your sweeping
generalizations evince your own ignorance What were they supposed to do
Just let him be Fuck him Fuck the ATF too They shouldve done it right
the first time

What is doing it right the first time  Murdered them all  Used tanks 
Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict  From the list presented
to date I havent seen ANYTHING illegal  They claim that the BDs bought
components to convert their weapons to Class III devices but no evidence that
they had done so  In fact with a Class III FFL living with them this may
have been legal given recent court rulings

What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and
lwaful thing  Or did you just want the BDs dead
