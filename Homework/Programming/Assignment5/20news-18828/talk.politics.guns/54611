I thought that the Clipper Chip that was posted to tpg sorry I lost
the original post was a joke  I really did  I didnt believe it for
a second  But on the way to work this morning I heard about it on NPR


No joke  Heres another copy for you to save  NPR hmmm  Did they
mention the part about The fact of law enforcement access to the
escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public

 Note     The following was released by the White House today in
           conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip
           encryption technology
 
                            FACT SHEET
 
                   PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT
 
 The President has approved a directive on Public Encryption
 Management  The directive provides for the following
 
 Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
 are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology
 Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
 communications and data by preventing unauthorized access
 Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
 rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications
 These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
 infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
 information age
 
 Despite its benefits new communications technology can also
 frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance  Sophisticated
 encryption can have this effect in the United States  When
 exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
 activities critical to our national interests  In the past it has
 been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
 electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
 enforcement and national security interests while at the same time
 protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens  As
 encryption technology improves doing so will require new
 innovative approaches
 
 In the area of communications encryption the U S Government has
 developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
 encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
 government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed
 to unlock the encryption  The system for the escrowing of keys
 will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
 only with appropriate legal authorization
 
 To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
 and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted
 information I hereby direct the following action to be taken
 
 INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENTDEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS
 
 The Attorney General of the United States or her representative
 shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
 incorporates encryption to install the US governmentdeveloped
 keyescrow microcircuits in their products  The fact of law
 enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from
 the American public  All appropriate steps shall be taken to
 ensure that any existing or future versions of the keyescrow
 microcircuit are made widely available to US communications
 hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the
 security of the keyescrow system  In making this decision I do
 not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the
 government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that
 are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key
 escrow system
 
 KEYESCROW
 
 The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate
 entities to hold the keys for the keyescrow microcircuits
 installed in communications equipment  In each case the key
 holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
 unauthorized release of the keys  The keys shall be released only
 to government agencies that have established their authority to
 acquire the content of those communications that have been
 encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits  The Attorney
 General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
 an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
 communications
 
 PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES
 
 The Secretary of Commerce in consultation with other appropriate
 US agencies shall initiate a process to write standards to
 facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
 with keyescrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
 that process sensitive but unclassified information  I expect this
 process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
 a final standard within six months of this directive
 
 The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to
 the extent needed to preserve the governments ability to conduct
 lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
 law enforcement communications  Further the Attorney General
 shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture
 Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase
