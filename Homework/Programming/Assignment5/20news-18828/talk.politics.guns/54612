Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS

In article 93112153005MGBSLACVMSLACSTANFORDEDU MGBSLACVMSLACSTANFORDEDU writes
From AP   According to numerous accounts by those in the compound
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane
tank and turning over numerous gas lanterns

	If there was a large propane tank and it was breached dont 
	you think that there would be an identifiable explosion
	Further the BD members have as much reason to lie as the 
	Govt


Medical Examiners have found no bullet wounds as was stated by the
FBI on the corpses

	Theyd only autopsied one body when this information was released
	I wouldnt doubt though


I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept
the governments story despite much evidence to the contrary

	The only evidence that exists right now at least what we know
	about is various claims and counter claims Im waiting until
	the hard evidence is released What about you
