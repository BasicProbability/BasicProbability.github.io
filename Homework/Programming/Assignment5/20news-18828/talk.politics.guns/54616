Anybody got Arlen Spectres address  I want to write to him and thank him
for showing the leadership to demand a Congressional investigation
into the Waco mess
 
If I had Arlens address I would go to his house Do weasels live
in houses or in holes and personally tell him what a pathetic idiot
he is  Arlen is the personification of the word jerk snip
 
Im no fan of Arlen Spectres but he did the right thing and attacking his
motives in this case is wrong 

Pardon me here but I dont trust Spectres motives here at all  Spectre
was a major part of the Warren Commission remember the magic bullet theory
and is NOT to be trusted if theres even the tiniest chance the guvmint may
have done something wrong  If he gets a chance Im afraid he will satisfy
the public outcry with another whitewash

Unfortunately if some of us get our wish and the BATF is disbanded or folded
into the FBI  etc we may end up with a more efficient agency than the
bumbling and competition we have today Some agents should be fired Some
should be prosecuted But keep them as bumbling as possible  we retain more
of our liberties that way

Right on the money here  We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the 
BARTF but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set
up the assault on American citizens  

We must NOT count on Spectre though to get it done
