Subject Re Nature of the Waco gas

In article 1993Apr2313023423728icdabcom kdwicdabcom Kenneth D Whitehead writes
 Saw a REAL interesting report on CNN last night  it seems the gas that
 was used has been banned by international law for military use  However
 our president was quick to point out that there are exemptions for law
 enforcement  Hmmm  too inhumane to use in war against the enemy
 but OK for civilians

Whoa  Think twice now unless you want the same standards applied to
hollowpoints
