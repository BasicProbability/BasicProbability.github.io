Gun buyback programs will hopefully
have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in streetlevel
crime

What gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on
any of these things  Evidence please

 Please dont misinterret  what I was saying Joe  I was making the point tha
there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
of common incidents

Saying hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y is much different
from saying hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y
Here youve made both statements
If the former describes a reasonablylikely outcome of policy X then
perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration  but the latter statement
is not something to base policy decisions on

 Firearms are the fifthleading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under

According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence formerly
the National Coalition to Ban Handguns  interesting name change dont you
think who include murder and suicide by firearms in the leading causes of
unintentional death figures but dont include murder and suicide by other
means as causes of unintentional death  Cant you see past the bullshit

  I dont understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important  So guns dont kill as many children as car accidents
What is the difference in severity between 1000 deaths and 10000 deaths
I am not trying to use accidental gunrelated deaths among children as a
justification for gun control  Who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem  I assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things  but the
antigun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by
firearms is a stastically serious problem and even if you dont use
these deaths as a justification for gun control these groups do  Im
sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning
accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern
but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun
control measures I think the conclusion was a reasonable one
The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may
be they are not a serious problem statistically speaking

Please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good

 My point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
departments MIGHT I stress might do a LITTLE I stress little good by
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way  Overall I thought that I
had made it clear that I did not think that gun buyback programs were
useful

Sorry if it wasnt clear to me  I thought you were waffling on your view
of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully
preventing accidents and heatofpassion shootings  I have to disagree on
all these counts I cant understand how a buying guns from people who
arent intending to misuse them obviously those who want to use guns to
commit crimes arent going to turn them in could be construed as a
positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence

I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics  I
suspect youll find if you look carefully that 135000 is the number of
students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun
to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students
who carry a gun to school daily

 Well Joe I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence

What the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit
suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL
METHODS per year  Who do you think I should believe  The people who call
everyone up to age 24 children when theyre screaming about the carnage
of our nations children being caused by handguns

or the Centers for Disease Control

Ah yes the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be
such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People
2000 document is to enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of
handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire minimizing the
likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children  The
agency that funded the study of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban
had saved X lives yes they actually gave us a number on the basis of
a look at the number of shootings rather than the rate of shootings
It wasnt their fault that the population of DC dropped in their post law
period


  If YOU look carefully you will see
that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths
The CPHV reports that 135000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that
400000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year  The CDC estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990

Okay Ill concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these  Ill
retract my dispute of your numbers  However I would be greatly interested
in seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers

  The CDC also says that 12 million elementaryaged latchkey
children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access
to guns in their home

Whats this got to do with anything  Hell when I was in elementary
school I came home to an empty house with guns in it  Why is this a
problem  I didnt touch the guns  I had been taught not to  I had also
been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage the fuse box the
car the knives the oven and the tools  The problem is not the guns
its the parents

  California schools reported a 200 increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 and a 40 increase between
1988 and 1990  Florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 198687 amd 198788  These are the statistics

And what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns
NOTHING  No criminal prosecution no expulsion in most cases not even
suspension  They take the gun slap the kids on the wrist say aint it
awful and go on as if everythings back to normal  Whats wrong with
this picture

 Okay maybe I worded it wrongDAD  I meant that to put children in a
situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the
act of a Messiah in my opinion  Im not saying that Koresh had control over
these children directly but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is
would not let innocent children die

I dont think Koresh was the Messiah either but isnt it obvious that
if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him then he
believed the children were much safer inside the compound  I didnt say
he was sane just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what
he thought was going on  He thought he had them in the one place where
harm wouldnt come to them

If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive

Lets see you try to find the exits unbarricade them and flee a fire
when youve been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected
to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault

  joe
