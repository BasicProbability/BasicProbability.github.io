From cgwillmepyrswanacuk r b willmersdorf
Subject Once upon a time 

american and european universities were full of Angry Young Peopletm
that wanted to overthrow the government and wouldnt think twice
about lobbing a molotov cocktail at the national guard military police
in Europe

Certainly it would have been very bad form to take anything
the Systemtm said at face value

This was in the end of the sixties and the begining of the seventies
Im told I was too young to remember

Something wrong happened along the way Im afraid  Maybe the west
became just too comfortable or maybe I was born too late 

Yours disappointed with with the youth of today

PS 1 Half smilies implied
    2 There is a difference between lining up 90 people against the
       wall and executing them and causing their deaths through negligence
       imcompetence  I honestly hope we witnessed the latter  As they say
       the alternative is too horrible to contemplate
    3 Im sure the Abused Childrentm from the compound are much 
       safer now
