 David Koreshs lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out
 peacefully sooner or later  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON
 THEIR HANDS  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
 this senseless tragedy  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE
 LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud
 
 	Koresh had lied and lied and lied about coming out of the
 	compound To the FBI To his lawyer To just about everyone

I keep hearing this but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two  As far as I am concerned I am not
ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
NATIONAL exposure  Well it never was  it was broadcast locally
in a choppedup fashion and thats all  And even then they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded national exposure
but not so cleverly that we didnt hear it

The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript
Well never know if he would have kept that one

 	The FBI etc cant wait forever for Koresh to come out As
 	long as they thought that Koreshs intended to surrender 
 	peacefully When they lost hope in that they decided to go
 	in 

Strangely enough the previous day they said they were prepared to
wait as long as it takes

	Further while the Mondays tactics were silly and clumsy
	they were obviously intended to drive the Davidians out of the
 	compound not to kill Koresh and his followers 

Quite possible  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing 
line between guilt and innocence  only the line between murder and 
negligent manslaughter

 	If it is true I read in the paper that the government 
 	listening devices inside the compound picked up orders to 
 	burn the joint down shortly before the fire was started Im
 	waiting to see what the tapes really hold

This would be an interesting development

 	The Davidian may be telling the truth or he may be lying
 	to save his skin from possible murder charges resulting from
 	the blaze Koreshs lawyer being the attorney for at least
 	one surviving Davidian has an interest in claiming that
 	the govt caused the fire at least as much as the govt
 	has an interest in blaming Koresh for the fire Its the
 	physical evidence that will decide whos telling what

Its too tempting for one or more of the survivors to go states
evidence parrot the FBI story hang the whole suicide on Koresh 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint etc  If any of them do this
in the next few weeks it doesnt prove much but if none of them
do it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is
dead wrong
