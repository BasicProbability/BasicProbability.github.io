people are getting killed by gang violence every day  Every single day I hear
about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the weapons
that are being confiscated

Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M16
from an AR15  That he can see the difference between a semiauto and
a fullauto UZI  That he can see the difference between the various
versions some fullauto some semiauto only of the M119

If so Id love to hear the details if only because theyll demonstrate
that Kratz is blowing smoke

Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like
another gun yet have very different properties and that thats
quite common

Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out
that my parents car wasnt much like Richard Pettys even though it
looked just like it except for the paint job  Things must have been
different with Kratz

Sure its on TV but why does that make a difference

No it doesnt but thats irrelevant  If visual inspection of the
outside worked TV would be acceptable but since it doesnt the fact
that its just as good as seeing in person doesnt mean much

andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private
