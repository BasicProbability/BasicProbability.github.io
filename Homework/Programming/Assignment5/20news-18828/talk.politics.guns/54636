 Janet Reno should be lauded for her decision to attack the 
 compound of the Davidians  I mean the last thing we 
 need in this country is more guntoting hicks who want
 to end the world  I think ATF the US Marshalls the FBI and local
 police forces should make a concerted effort to rid us 
 of the scourge of rebellious freaks
 
 Welch eine Wonne  Welch ein Leiden

	While dedicating the Holocaust Memorial Museum President 
Clinton remarked

	The evil represented in this museum is incontestable 
but as we are its witness so must we remain its adversary in the 
world in which we live so we must stop the fabricators of history 
and the bullies as well

	Clinton made this comment shortly after giving Janet Reno 
the goahead to hastily construct a gas chamber and crematorium
in Waco on the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw uprising

	Say wasnt Monday also the anniversary of Paul Reveres ride
Is that a clue

     Remember the Alamo         Truth is what the government chooses to
