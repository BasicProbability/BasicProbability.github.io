Subject Re Whos next Mormons and Jews

In 1993Apr2000352222480midwayuchicagoedu thf2kimbarkuchicagoedu Ted Frank writes

The Koreshians rubbed themselves out  Neither Mormons nor Jews have a
propensity for dousing themselves with kerosene so Im not particularly
concerned  Or shall we blame Jim Jones on the government also

The suggestion that they Davidians committed suicide is
completely without evidence  Except for the editorials

Please reword  propensity for allegedly dousing themselves

Oh and the survivors claim the the FBI started the burning
by accidentally igniting kerosene lanterns remember that theyd
already cut the power and the propane tanks  This sounds
a lot more likely than committing suicide by setting the place
afire
