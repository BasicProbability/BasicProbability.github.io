both of my Senators and my Rep  I also called the White House
comment line was on hold for 810 minutes so maybe LOTS of people
are calling  Please call your Congress CritterWH comment line NOW
 
 	Just a general note I have seen several polls lately and they
 show a large majority a thinks that this incident was handled ok and
 b thinks that the FBI and BATF gave them more than enough time 51 days
 to come out

I take it that when something happens that is wrong its okay if
a bunch of people say it is  For instance if some people go on a
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
does this mean that what these people have done isnt bad  This is an
example of mob rule not a democracya democracy in which peoples
rights are protected  I hope that Ive made myself clear on this

Make the following points

 1 Your outrage over todays behaviour
 
 	And what if Im not outraged

Fineyou have the right to hold any opinion that you want to  But
let me ask you this  are you outraged over this tragedy  I hope
that you are your opinions of David Koresh and his followers not
withstanding  I know I am

 2 Since BATF Chief Higgens AND Janet Reno were the 2 who signed off
    on this plan demand that they be fired
 
 	Actually they should both be commended

Why  Id be interested in hearing your reasons

 5 Point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the
    building it came as a direct result of the actions of the FBIBATF
    And the people inside including 17 children deserved a trial instead
    of this
 
 	What I want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do  I
 can see it nowthe 11 oclock news  FBI and BATF agents still
 surround the Waco compound after 451 days  I dont think so  They gave
 them every chance  They had 51 days to surrender to proper authorities
 They had attornies representing them etc  Koresh lied time and time again
 I dont wish them dead but you cant let it stalemate forever  It was time
 to do something and the FBI and BATF did  What happened was unfortunate
 but acceptable as long as the FBI didnt set the fire intentionally
