  Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion

  Baptists are a cult two BTW under most of the definitions in the dictionary  
  of cult

 Ive yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambells soup
 and M16sAR15s

Know any Mormons

 and bangingmarrying thirteen yuear olds

Know for a fact that this was happening  State of Texas says it wasnt
and they held a trial to prove it

 Youre a sorry
 son of a bitch if you cant draw a distinction between these two things

Sure we can  The top two things are perfectly legal  The bottom one
isnt  The person here who cant distinguish seems to be you

 People like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
 who arent deserved of it

So the constitution is only for people you approve of  Fine fine
I usually refer to that as elitism because bigotry is so negative

 Get a life and chill on the paranoia

Knowing that people like you are out there really gives me warm fuzzies
