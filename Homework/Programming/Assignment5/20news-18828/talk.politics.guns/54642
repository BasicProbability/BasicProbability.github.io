 You seem to make two points  No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies  
 you mention and since Koresh apparently has a different view point from your  

Ive yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambells soup
and M16sAR15s and bangingmarrying thirteen yuear olds Youre a sorry

Hmm all reports from Texas authorities indicate that none of the children
which the group released showed any signs of child abuse given that the same
results were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations
I can pretty much state that I strongly suspect the government of disinformation
deception on this issue  And about stockpiling weaponsfood many recognized
religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food and some even
maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition why are those two facts grounds 
for an armed assault  And from the dollar value of the weapons purchased 
if they bought decent firearms it comes out to about one handgun rifle and
shotgun for each adult with a few extras  Going by that rule the BATF
best get ready for the fight of their life when they assault Alabama
