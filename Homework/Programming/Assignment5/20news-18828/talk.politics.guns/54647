 And a few other questions  Like I said I believe the actions taken in
 general were proper  But I still have some reservations

Weve heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in Waco but the brainwashing
of the general population never ceases to amaze me Here is an
example of action being taken which results in the worst possible
outcome and despite peoples deep intuition telling them something
is wrong the programming will still cut in and say that the
agents probably acted in good faith NO THEY DIDNT They either did
not have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted
knowing the risk Sums up human stupidity all over and one of these
days it will destroy the fucking planet Oh sorry Didnt think they
would respond by launching a strike All our best calculations told
us they were bluffing
