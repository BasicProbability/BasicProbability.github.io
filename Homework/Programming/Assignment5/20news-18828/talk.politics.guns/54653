Does a not harmful gassing mean that you can with a little willpower
stay inside indefinitely without suffering any serious health problems

If so why was CS often employed against tunnels in Vietnam

What IS the difference anyway

CS teargas was used in Vietnam because it makes you wretch so hard that
your stomach comes out thru your throat  Well not quite that bad but
you cant really do much to defend yourself while you are blowing cookies

Interesting after several hours worth of exposure do you still posess
the presence of mind to be able to determine how to escape from an inferno
surrounding you  In other words is it possible that the prolonged gassing
disoriented the wackos enough that possibility of escape was rendered
questionable
