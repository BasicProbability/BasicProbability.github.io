 sigh I just DONT understand why they couldnt have waited KoreshCo
 out  jlpicardaustinibmcom

 Uh maybe because it was costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a
 day to just sit and wait

Yeah  We dont want to spend too much money preserving lives after
all  Escpecially when theyre all just a bunch of crazy fanatic
cultists anyway instead of normal people

The above is supposed to be dripping with sarcasm but Im too burned
out right now get it burned out ha ha to tell if its working
Look folks what David Koresh and his followers were was broken  It
takes a certain amount of flexibility and insanity to survive in this
world and they didnt have enough of it and that wasnt their fault  So
please stop dancing on their graves okay
