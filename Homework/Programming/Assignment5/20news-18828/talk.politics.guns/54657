 Just to shed some light on the fire it was widely reported AP etc that
 there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires  It has also
 been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once which
 rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp etc as the cause
 
 Consider this The BDs had more than one lamp The tanks made more than
 one hole in the building Did anyone else notice on the video that it
 appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building there
 was a tank nearby
 
 The fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not
 rule out anything

I watched it live and have rewatched it several times and from the press  
vantage point there was only one starting point visible where the tank  
punched in on the windward side and the winds whipped that fire across the  
whole dry wooden structure in minutes  Faned by the 30 mph gusts and the  
Hueys   If there were other fires started they were not visible nor were  
they needed to cause the flame progression I observed
 
 Also where are these several witnesses The way I heard it from the FBI
 spokesman on CNN the witnesses were all people driving the tanks
 
All witnesses get thier paychecks from the FBI

 One other point Im no fan of Janet Reno but I do like the way she had the
 balls to go ahead and take full responsibility  Seems like the waffle boy
 had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue
 
 Too bad nothing will happen to her or him The FBI and the media have
 done their job well
 
Yep  They media has endorsed the FBI version without question  Sad
