Surrender your arms Soon enough officers will be around to collect
them Resistance is useless They will overwhelm you  one at a time
       

Listen buddy if youre going to quote Star Trek get the quote right  It was
Resistance is futile  Get it right the next time 

Sounds like a VOGON quote to me Perhaps YOU should READ more widely 
instead of watching that idiot box
