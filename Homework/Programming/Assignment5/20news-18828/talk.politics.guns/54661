Subject Re Rewording the Second Amendment ideas

dfovttoulutkovttfi Foxvog Douglas writes

Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined  Other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry  Licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals

I am not a lawyer but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds  Given
about 10k in lab equipment and chemicals which are commercially available
and given the knowledge that I have graduating BS Ch 1993 I could 
synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population
of several major US cities  As also noted the knowledge is there for
the production of nuclear weapons  Its not even that restricted  The
only thing is the expense  

Now Im not going around making these things but its not cause of any
law I simply dont get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone  Any
law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to 
add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons  In the
case of chemical agents I seriously doubt that you would even know that
someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used  

Part of the trouble with the chemicalweapons ban treaty between the US
and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as
GB and Sarin etc is that they have very valid commercial uses and 
it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture
without anyone knowing about it
