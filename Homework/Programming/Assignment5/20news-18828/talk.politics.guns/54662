Subject reference needed


Does anybody have any solid data on how many legally owned versus
illegally owned firearms are used in crime  I know the number of
legally owned guns used in crime is small but I would like a number
and a reference if possible

Data should be emailed to me
Open discussion should be directed to talkpoliticsguns
