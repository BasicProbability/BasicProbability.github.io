Subject Need Senate Bill numbers and House Resolution numbers

Sorry for posting this here but noone has replied to my post from the politics
side of the group

I want to get involved in the fight to save our gun rights  But first I need
to get a little more educated  Ive been reading all the magzines and books I
can get my hands on and sifting through hundreds of messages here in the 
Internet

I want to obtain a COMPLETE list of Senate Bill and House Resolution
namesnumbers

Can anyone tell me howwhere to obtain this info  Surely there has to be a
way to obtain copies of antigun legislation from those s in Washington

Any help is appreciated
