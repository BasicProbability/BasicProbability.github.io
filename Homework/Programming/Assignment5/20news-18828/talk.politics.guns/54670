 I just caught the last bit of the street stories segment on 
 woman and gunsWhat caught my eye was that two woman were
 shown on the program in mass and both were carrying 
 concealed Can you obtain a CCW in mass for the ordinary citizen 

CCWs are issued at the discretion of the police chief so it varies
town by town

In my town forget about anything more than target and sport carry to
and from the gun club  hunting area only unless youre Mr Moneybags
with Large Daily Deposits  Your life isnt worth shit but your money 
now thats important  In other towns they treat law abiding citizens
like adults  

Secret game hint you never know when the rules will be changed  a change 
in police chief can throw a town from either side of the board to the other
 fun for the whole family

Some chiefs will grant you a personal protection permit if you have been
attacked or threatened  Some other bluesuited assholes have been known to 
count this as a NEGATIVE against applicants

Its a crap shoot and your rights are the stakes
