JKIf they had rocket launchers and such as the press and gov claims why
JKshouldnt they have done something  What possible use would a religious cult
JKhave for a rocket launcher  Also is child abuse covered by the Bill of
JKRights


This is taken a little out of context and Im not flaming Jasonits just
that this was the proverbial straw

I grow a little weary of the allegations here the media people on the
street that the BDs had all these horrible illegal weapons and other
paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks 50 feet into the air
and then without missing a beat discuss how the BDs willfully commited
mass suicide or killed their own less fanatical and then commited mass
suicide etc etc

If the BDs had all these things and intended to blow up their abode blow up
Waco blow up the entire country or whatever suits your fancy what happened
to all the violence they were supposed to unleash Why wouldnt they have gone
out in the proverbial blaze of glory and come out shooting with an attitude
of lets take as many of those dogs as possible with us

Instead they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in
store for them at the governments hands

Its totally immaterial whether they were all crazy all fanatics all followers
of the antichrist haters of the government practicers of weird lifestyles or
whateverthey must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing
their beliefs however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to you
and me There is much precedent for such devotion to cause

My conclusion at this point is that the authorities seriously misread their
danger to society else why did the BDs not do as suggested above andor chose
this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda up to
and including AG J Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood

Some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what
they perceive as the godless government When I force myself to not judge
others by my own personal standards and beliefs I can almost admire their
stand

I surely believe in the Constitution but I dont know that I have such strength
of conviction as evidenced by the BDs
