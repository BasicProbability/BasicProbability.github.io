Subject Re Rewording the Second Amendment ideas



Chemical weapons are not concidered a very effectiv weapon against
millitary forces On civillians on the other hand

Thats one GOOD reason for banning it

You need VAST amounts of chemicals to be affective so the best reason
to haveuse it is price thats why its called The Poor Mans Abomb

Any thoughts on Bioweapons 	

If this discusion is about civillians having chemweapons
What should they use them on Rob a bank 



	This is not a signature
	Its merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith
	and to bring down the evil Internet
