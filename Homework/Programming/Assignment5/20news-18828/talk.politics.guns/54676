 Its hard to know whatwho to believe  However the letter I received from
 the BATF in response to one I sent to Bentsen said that there was a search
 warrant AND an arrest warrant

Check again  You may find that the arrest warrant was issued AFTER the
first firefight

The letter implies that both warrants were issued before the Feb 28th
shootout but doesnt say so exlicitly  ACK
