Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS

In article 3876nlsun1oraclenl jdurbinnloraclecom Jason Durbin writes
 If even half the speculations of conspiracy made about this are
 true then I would expect that you people should be calling for
 the ATF FBI Texas Rangers Congress and all branches of the
 US government to be immediately and completey disbanded    no
 exceptions 

Well were not  Which goes to prove you still dont understand what
were saying here

 Jeez do you people really beleive all this crap Do you also beleive
 in the Zionist Occupation Government and the tooth fairy

Ive lived through the bombing of Cambodia My Lai inflated body counts
in VietNam the funding of Noreiga Watergate Contragate Chappaquiddick
Kent State domestic spying by the CIA Edwin Meeses Pornography 
Commission the War on Drugs civil seizure the MOVE disaster the LA 
disaster and now Waco

Do you really believe that government always does what is right

 Admittedly mistakes were made but why attribute them to malice rather
 than stupidity

Watch the news for the next couple of months  Watch how this whole
governmentinitiated debacle turns into shouting for more gun control
Its already started
