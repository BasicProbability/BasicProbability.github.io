Question 2

As I understand it in Evanston IL they have a ordinance banning handguns
Is there any way to get around this provision

Why dont you call the City and ask Oak Park also has an illegal handgun
ban as well but does allow those with a collectors FFL to possess
collectible handguns

What would the penalty if you were found out be

Probably a fine in practical terms

What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment 
there  How would the city law apply to your impending 
trial for the shooting

It wouldnt impede your defense at all There was an actual incident
in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a
handgun the grand jury decided not to presecute On the other hand
a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend
himself and the Village tried to make an example out of him An NRA
Director who lived there made a stink about this and it was decided
not to charge the guy Of course pissing off antigun police thugs
has its own drawbacks like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his
house and told him this is stepping over the line this could get
dangerous for you Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers
watched over his house to ensure that the white antigun police chief
and his antigun cronies wouldnt fck with him his home or family

Also what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons  Short barreled
shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available 
either that or a shortened 9mm carbine ie Colt Marlin  

LV Cipriani states that the Any other weapon category is allowed
but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Autoburgular which I
believe is in the Any other weapon category and a chopped barrel
HK HK94 Class 3 for sure is not clear to me

One more thing what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
rich or famous or related to the mayor

In your dreams buddy As long as Democrats reign in Chicago Illinois
residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets Politicians
get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry
concealed weapons Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these aholes
out of office because the Dems are always in power the Illinois 
Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Partys views on guns
All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are
antigun which explains antiRKBA Crook County States Attorney 
Jackass OMalley being a socalled Republican

Get rid of the Chicago Democrats get rid of their members on the IL
Judiciary and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW
law
