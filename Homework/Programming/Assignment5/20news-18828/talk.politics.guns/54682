Subject Re Change of name 

In article C5y9x77v0wellsfcaus seelowewellsfcaus Hudson H Luce writes

  I suggest another name change

    Thomas Parsli  to  Vidkun Quisling

This is really uncalled for

You cannot expect a European growing up in a culture of rulers and 
subjects to immediately grasp the concepts of individual independence
and citizen sovereignity in the US

Hes less at fault than the countrymen we have here who also cant grasp it
