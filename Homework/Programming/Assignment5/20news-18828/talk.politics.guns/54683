 that wanted to overthrow the government and wouldnt think twice
 about lobbing a molotov cocktail at the national guard military police
 in Europe

 Certainly it would have been very bad form to take anything
 the Systemtm said at face value

 This was in the end of the sixties and the begining of the seventies
 Im told I was too young to remember

 Something wrong happened along the way Im afraid  Maybe the west
 became just too comfortable or maybe I was born too late 

 Yours disappointed with with the youth of today

Isnt it ironic  Im of that generation and I remember the lesson  I
cry to see all the postings from domestic edu sites that have naively
swallowed everything the government has seen fit to feed to them
Especially contrasted to such a post from the uk yet

     2 There is a difference between lining up 90 people against the
        wall and executing them and causing their deaths through negligence
        imcompetence  I honestly hope we witnessed the latter  As they say
        the alternative is too horrible to contemplate

I suspect we saw the latter  However the injustice implied in letting
those involved escape without investigation andor prosecution is also
horrible to contemplate
