   A well regulated militia being necessarry to the security of a free state
   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

  What is regulated Regulated means controlled How about security

While it may mean that in 1993 the relevant meaning comes from 1789
Moreover controlled doesnt tell you WHOs doing the controllling

Fletchers Political Works pubd in 1749 defines a wellregulated
militia that being the relevant phrase as being an armed people NOT
under the control of govt  The wigged gents who argued about the
constituion used it in that way

Feel free to provide a 1790sera reference showing a usage other than
individual right not to be interfered with by govt

Note that the first clause has a meaning  it is a restriction on
govt military power  See Scarrys University of Penn law review
article for an extended discussion  The existence of a wellregulated
militia is a necessary part of that restriction but it is not sufficient
