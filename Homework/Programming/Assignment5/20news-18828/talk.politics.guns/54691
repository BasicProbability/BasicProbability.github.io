people are getting killed by gang violence every day  Every single day I hear
about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the weapos
that are being confiscated

Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M16
from an AR15  That he can see the difference between a semiauto and
a fullauto UZI  That he can see the difference between the various
versions some fullauto some semiauto only of the M119

Well let me see  UZI no  M119 no

I see that I misphrased my question  I should have asked WHICH
fullautos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semiauto
lookalikes  I should have also included some semiauto only guns in
my list to see if hed ask how to distinguish them from their
nonexistent fullauto relatives

Lets do the former now  Kratz has claimed that he can visually
distinguish fullautos from semiautos  For which fullautos is he
making that claim  How does he do it  Lets get specific and as
exhaustive as possible

M16AR15 maybe  I remember there
being a selector swtich on the AR15  If I remember correctly please correct
me if Im wrong the switch would set to an off position or an on position
because the gun AR15 is semiautomatic  Wouldnt the M16 have a position
for semiauto fire and fullauto fire or maybe 3 round bursts

Maybe  Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows

Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from
a two position switch via TV inspection  Does he even get to see the
switch in the typical police display of guns  Note that one might
well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection
even though it wont be seen on TV  And to think that Kratz was
telling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being
there

How about the other guns  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
semiauto and fullyauto fire

Why all the questions  Kratz assured us that he could make this distinction
and now hes asking us how he did it

Well what about what I said above  If that is correct I guess TV would be
acceptable if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower 
receiver of the AR15M16

What about it  It only demonstrates that as I predicted Kratz
was blowing smoke on this

andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private

Jason Kratz  didnt take andys offer to back down in private

andy wonders what Kratz is learning from this
