 napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it
                       
 As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
 in Texas 

Do YOU eat all your food cold

Ever hear of electric ovens or microwaves  Very popular
Electric stoves outside metroareas especially

Ever hear about cutting off the electricity That was done
How effective is an electric stove then

Didnt the Branch Davidans have an emergency generator Oh well I dont think
Brent thought of that anyway

Peoples organizations rarely stay that way or even begin as such 
I only speak for myself If I did speak for UT would anyone listen
