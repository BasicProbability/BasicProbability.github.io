 In Texas you cannot carry a handgun  Period  Either concealed or open

  Currently there is a bill before the Texas legislature that would make it
legal for some ordinary folks to carry concealed weapons  I dont have the
details sorry

If I recall correctly the bill would provide for concealed carry if
the person takes a 15hr DPS safety course in firearms and pays a 150
fee for the license  The bill is apparently vetoproof in the House
but LtGov Bullock has said it will never come to the floor of the
Senate and Dreamboat Annie has vowed to veto it if it comes to her
desk  shrug
