From dusekrtsgmotcom James P Dusek

ccdargdctacuk Alan Greig writes
or the cultists I think Ill quote the BBC quoting actually voice
interview one of the two British survivors He claimed that the fire
started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wallroof to collapse
knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan

	If the FBI started the fire why didnt people flee the
burning building
