In article C5s5n0DyJworldstdcom rjkworldstdcom Robert J Kolker writes
 Thank you for remembering Matzada  Matzada was not an insane act It was
 a sanctification of GDs name and the most extreme denial of tyranny
 possible To this day the officers of the Tzahal Isreal Defense Force
 take their oath at the fortress Lo Tepol Shaynit Matzadah Matzadah will
 not fall again
 

Not anymore  Recent archaeological inspection of the site presents pretty
compelling evidence that the mass suicide at Masada never occured  This
evidence was so compelling tha the Tzahal no long hold their secret ceremony
at the fortress
