Subject The Holocaust Revisited

The US Governments campaign of persecution and genocide against the
Branch Davidians was a resounding success

Heil Clinton  Heil Reno  The Gestapo is alive and well and living in
Washington DC

 
Kevin who agrees that David Koresh was probably a firstrate nutcase
       but who firmly believes that the Bill of Rights guaranteed his
       his right to be a religious fanatic and that the government is
       guilty of violating his civil rights and of 1st degree murder

       OK which small underrepresentedincongress religious group
       are we going to persecute next and are we going to torch their
       church with a rolled up copy of the Constitution

       I think Im going to be sick now
