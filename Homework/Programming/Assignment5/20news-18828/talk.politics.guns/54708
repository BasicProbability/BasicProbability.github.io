Subject Re S414 Brady bill loopholes

Hi Ive just finished reading S414 and have several questions about
the Brady bills S414 and HR1025

Good

1 Are these the current versions of the Brady bill
     What is the status of these bills  Ive heard theyre in committee
     How close is that to being made law

Not very  Thanks to the filibuster in the Senate things are backing up  The
House judiciary  is going to start looking at our friends from the ATF so that
bill will be held up a little too  NOTE Things can change quickly


2 S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar  Are there any important
   differences I missed

3 S414 seems to have some serious loopholes
  A S414 doesnt specify an appeals process to wrongful denial during
     the waiting period other than a civil lawsuit  S414 has an appeals
     process once the required instant background check system is established
     but not before

I thought there was a correction process in both bills for both parts

  B the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denyingapproving
     using existing records so who would I sue in A above to have an
     inaccurate record corrected

Very correct

  C S414 includes an exceptiontowaitingperiod clause for if a person
     can convince the local Chief LawEnforcement Officer CLEO of an
     immediate threat to his or her life or life of a household member
     But S414 doesnt say exactly what is considered a threat nor does
     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception
     statement

Welcome to the world of the privileged

True  Have I misunderstood  Any other holes

How about no compulsion to allow purchase if there is no evidence against


4 With just S414 whats to stop a person with a clean record from
   buying guns grinding off the serial numbers and selling them to crooks
   At minimum what additional laws are needed to prevent this

It is already illegal to do this


   Seems at min a gun counting scheme would be needed
   eg John Doe owns N guns  So if S414 passes I wouldnt be surprised
   to see legislation for stricter hardertoforge IDs plus national gun
   registration justified by a need to make the Brady bill work

This is the health card  Or so some paranoids claim  I say that just
because youre paranoid doesnt mean theyre not out to get you    12


Please comment  Im mainly interested in specific problems with the current
legislationI dont mean to start a general discussion of the merits
of anyall waitingperiod bills ever proposed
