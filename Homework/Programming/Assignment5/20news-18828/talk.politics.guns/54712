 Maybe Im too religious but when I see a bill to establish a right
 I wince  Keep in mind what the law giveth the law can taketh away

 Hey guys  Youre absolutely correct and well on the way to winning
 this battle  and losing the war  Yes there are serious philosophical
 flaws in HR 1276  Technical ones too  howd you like to sue the Feds
 lose and have to pay their reasonable Attorneys fee      

 Still I have one basic question  compared to what weve got is HR 1276
 a better or b worse  This one shouldnt even take you three guesses

Compared to the Second Amendment  I think its worse

The problem is the devil is in the details  You know the Brady Bill
sounds like a good idea too until you discover that there is NO check
and that the police DONT have to allow your purchase even if you check
out and that you have NO recourse if they dont

Are there any loopholes here  Im no lawyer I cant be sure  I
would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady
Bill for example

The more words involved the more details  What was that saying about
Abraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves and the modern
Congress requiring 3000000 words to describe price controls on rice

 If theres a good enough show of support for HR 1276 maybe for a change
 we could be the ones saying its a reasonable first step 

That only works with bad laws  Good laws are like good computer programs  
Quality has to be written in from the start not added on later
