  I find this disturbing 

 Good  Keep thinking critically

 Dont patronize me and I wont patronize you

Feel free to patronize me all you like I need the tips 
Seriously if you were insulted I apologize

 The most tiresome thing about this group is that so many people 
 tell others they are sucking up to the government when ever they 
 decide that something the government says is plausible and praise 
 them as independent thinkers whenever they find something the government 
 says implausible

People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives

However from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night its
no longer necessary to be an independent thinker to depart from the
governments party line  It looks like our independent press may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance  This to me is
a good sign  I hope it continues

 Heres a clue  Independent thinkers are able to come to either conclusion 
 depending on the circumstances  Noncritical thinkers are the ones who would 
 always come to the same type of conclusion regardless of the circumstances

Independent thinkers question authority  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented coming to a conclusion is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless its coupled with the ability
to challenge those facts critically  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis its even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed
