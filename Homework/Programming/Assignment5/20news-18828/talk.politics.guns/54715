  Perhaps youve been under a rock the last few days  The BATF and the FBI
  are both federal agencies  Clinton has admitted in front of news cameras
  that Janet Reno the once and future Attorney General gave him a full
  briefing of what was planned before they did it and he gave her the
  go ahead

  Maybe just possibly that makes him a teensy bit responsible

 Perhaps youve been under a rock since say the turn of the century How
 in the  is one man supposed to review every single freaking
 governmental action every day Thats why we have an executive branch HE
 reviewed the plan and said go but he wasnt the architect and he wasnt
 there bullhorn in hand implementing it Yes he was responsible in the
 sense that he was briefed So what Shit happens 

Hey joe  assuming youre old enough to remember it  how did you feel
about presidential responsibility every time Reagan said I dont recall 
about his armsforhostages meetings with the Ollie North gang

How did you feel about it when Bush said he was out of the loop on that
decision when he was right there in the thick of it

Oh right  He was responsible in the sense that he was briefed but so
what  shit happens  Is that what you said
