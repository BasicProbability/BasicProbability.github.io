Subject Question on Senate Bills

 Im writting letters to my Congresscritters and was wondering if
 there is any reasons why I should NOT support the following
 Bills other than the previous comments about S458  Just checking
 before I mail the letter to make sure I dont support something
 that I really shouldnt

 
 I strongly SUPPORT the following laws currently being considered in Congress
 as they would either have a positive effect towards reducing crime or re
 enforce our Constitutional right under the 2nd amendment

  S 441 Campbell	To amend title 18 United States Code to provide a
			mandatory minimum sentence for the unlawful possession
			of a firearm by a convicted felon a fugitive from
			justice a person who is addicted to or an unlawful
			user of a controlled substance or a transferor or
			receiver of a stolen firearm to increase the general
			penalty for violation of Federal firearms laws
			and to increase the enhanced penalties provided for the 
			possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of 
			violence or drug trafficking crime and for other
			purposes

  S458  Smith 	To restore the second Amendment Rights of all Americans

  S488  Specter	To provide Federal penalties for driveby shootings

  S504  Kohl	To amend section 924 of title 18 United States Code to
			make it a Federal crime to steal a firearm or explosives
			in interstate or foreign commerce

 Heres a story bout a man named Brady who took a 22 bullet
 in his head  Even though he can act perfectly normal he
 prefers to pretend hes brain dead

 Heres a story bout a woman named Brady who had nothing to
 do but sit around all day  Then her husband became a media
 martyr now she wants to take all your guns away

 The Brady Bunch The Brady Bunch This is how we got stuck
 with the Brady Bunch
