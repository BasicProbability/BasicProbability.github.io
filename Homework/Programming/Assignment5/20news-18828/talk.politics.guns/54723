Subject The Dayton Gun Buy Back Re Boston Gun Buy Back

According to WNCI 979 FM radio this morning Dayton Ohio is operating a
gun buy back  They are giving 50 for every functional gun turned in
They ran out of money in one day and are now passing out 50 vouchers of
some sort  They are looking for more funds to keep operating  Another
mediaevent brought to you by HCI

Is there something similar progun people can do   For example pay 100
to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm   Sounds a bit
tacky but hey whatever works
