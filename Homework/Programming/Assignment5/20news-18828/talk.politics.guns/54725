That the gas was not harmful as the sensitive caring Janet Reno described 
it

Is it As far as I know tear gas especially in large concentrations
is very dangerous even toxic for small children This makes the
FBIs supposedconcern for the safety of the children seem rather 
hypocritical


Not to mention that the Gmen believed the children didnt have gas masks

But that was not with respect to the children the point of the gassing
The feds knew that the childrens health would be in danger and proceeded
under the assumption that the motherly instinct of the Davidian women
would remove them from harms way I busted a gut on that one

Someone else on the net observed that the administrations appeal to a
womans motherly instinct would never wash with feminists and liberals
if a republican were in the White House I say that such an justification
could only come from a feminist mindset 

BTW  Id read in the paper yesterday that the type of gas used was CS2
The paper didnt provide any specifics about it
