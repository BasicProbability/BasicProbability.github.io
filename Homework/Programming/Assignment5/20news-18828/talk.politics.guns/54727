 If anyone wants to understand the paranoid mindset of Koresh I offer you
 talkpoliticsguns There you can dredge the sewers of minds so hung
 up on power and ego trips that they bend reality arround their own
 particular set of beleifs

Just what the hell do you base that ludicrous claim on  There are 
plenty of fine decent people people who readpost to tpg  If
any of these people are paranoid it is because of people like you

Hey dude you are making me paranoid What an argument


 I long ago gave up arguing the case for arms control directly Instead
 I invite people to ask themselves would you want to be in a room full
 of the occupants of talkpoliticsguns their personal armouries and
 attempt to enter a discussion with them

Id have a spot of tea with them   You probably gave up on arguing the
case for arms control directly long ago because posters who know
what they are talking about eg Frank Crary disproved all your
arguments for why more gun control is needed  So you gave up because
you know they are right and you couldnt refute their answers

No Frank Crarys arguments are based on the assumption that most people
are sane normal people tpg disproves this of gun owners USEnet as a whole
disproves it of humanity as a whole

We now have proof positive that guns dont make you safer Buy a lot of
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the FBI to burn
down your house See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
to support gun control


Cuddles n kisses
