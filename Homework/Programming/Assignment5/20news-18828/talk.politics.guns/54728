 Obnly something like 12 of guns used in crime in the US are purchased 
 from legitimate dealers and not necessarily by the person who used them
 in the crime  So we already HAVE that much gun control
 
 Ive seen this mentioned a number of times Im curious what is the
 source for this statistic 

The number bounces between 2 and 18 depending on the study quoted and
the type of gun being studied

Some cites



A recent BATF study titled Protecting America Yes surveyed 471 career 
criminals and found that only 7 of guns used in violent crimes were
purchased from retail dealers

1 Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct
    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders

Only about onesixth of the gunowning felons obtained their most
recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a
licensed firearms dealer  The remainder  five out of six 
obtained them via informal offtherecord transactions involving
friends and associates family members and various black market
outlets  The means of acquisition from these informal sources
included cash purchase swaps and trades borrowing and renting and
often theft  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated
by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply

              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY
                             By David B Kopel

     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville
The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous
criminals51  In short waiting periods have no statistically noticeable
impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns
are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers

                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel

     Testimony before Congress revealed that most assault weapons in the
hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels97  The testimony
is consistent with the National Institute of Justices research findings
based on studies of felons in state prisons The NU study authored by
sociologists James D Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent
of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store The
figures included purchases by legal surrogates rather than directly by the
criminal Wright and Rossi who had begun their research as firm proponents
of gun control concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases and
probably not even full scale gun prohibition would reduce criminal use of
guns Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime
directly target the black market in criminal guns and
leave the legitimate retail market alone98   Not surprisingly Wright
believes that the consequences of current assault weapon legislation on
street violence are likely to be ineffective99   He warns that gun
controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of
criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new
business100
