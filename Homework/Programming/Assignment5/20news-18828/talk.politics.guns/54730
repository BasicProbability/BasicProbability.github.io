Subject Re Need info on 43 1 and suicide for refutation

In article 1qmuv8INNl8sdns1NMSUEdu lokiaccanmsuedu Entropic Destroyer writes

The following is quoted from the tail end of a rather condescending
article about Paxton Quigley that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies
sorry i think it was in the wall street journal
and was repeated in the Colorado peoples Daily a student newspaper
at the University of Colorado at Boulder

A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County Wash found that
a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner
                    

spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder  

       The used to kill is the heart of the misinformation  Its one
of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression
What Mr Quiqley is more than aware of Im sure is that when people
read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family
grabs a gun and shoots another thereby creating a tragic situation
which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there or
a tragic accident especially involving a child

       Unfortunately thats not the way things stack up  The majority
of that 43 times 37 I believe are suicides  That is someone 
intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill 
themselves  And why its popular to try and blame suicides on guns
the evidence doesnt support this  Internal studies as well as
comparative studies with other countries indicate that cultural
factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not
Japan for instance has a slightly higher rate than the US  There
people jump off buildings

       According to the National Crime Survey 40 of violent crime
is commited by nonstrangers which mistakenly has been generalized
regarding the King County study to mean Friends and family  That
is Mr Quigley and others who quote this statistic are banking on
the mental image that a Friend family member or child equates
to a loving relationship and that it was cut short in a moment of
anger  Unfortunately all too often husbands beat and kill wives
children assault parents or viceversa  Most rapes are commited by 
someone known to the victim for instance  Essentially that a gun
was used against a friend or family member doesnt mean they
werent trying to hurt the other person  Crime is highest among
poor urban families and those are also the areas most at risk
for family problems especially violent ones  A son in a gang may
not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban
kid might

       Finally it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the
only value of a selfdefense firearm  Using the minimum figures I
worked out using the NCS I got about an 801 ratio between deadly
selfdefenses justifiable homicides and withgun selfdefenses
Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS theres an enormous
amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers
As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid
means of determining the success of such a defense since according
to the NCS which has been considered by many to seriously underreport
defenses there were far more successful withgun defenses than intruders
killed

       Not it also confines itself to the home where attack by a friend
or family member is far far more likely and excludes any defense
which occurs outside the home  I believe a large number occur in
businesses

Studies by the 
Western Psychiatric Institute in Pittsburgh found that the mere presence
of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
will commit suicide even in the absence of psychiatric illness

       I have not seen the exact data for this so I cant comment  I
will point out Canadas and Japans suicide rate as indications that
culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates

       There was also a comparative study between Canada for what
its worth considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural
lines published in the New England Journal of Medicine I can get the
exact cite if you need it that concluded that restrictive firearm laws 
would not significantly impact the overall suicide rate
