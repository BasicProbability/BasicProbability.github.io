Hell a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to  The only thing
that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it  Sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isnt too great of a safety

Now we know that Kratz doesnt understand what a safety is supposed to
do  He also confuses things he can see with things that exist
Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
outside

Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to do

Kratz comments above show otherwise

Its basic purpose  not to let the gun fire until youre ready

Bingo  now the question is does the Glocks qualify  Lets see
the evidence that Kratz uses

Christ Ive known that since I had my first Crosman air gun  You dont
know me so dont make assumptions about what I know and dont know

But first an aside  Having an air gun proves nothing  Moreover
my comments are based on what Kratz writes  Hes free to argue that
he babbles in text but actually knows something offline

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS thats
what the user wants  With Glocks one says I want the gun to go
off by pulling the trigger  If the safeties it has make that work
it has a real safety no matter what Kratz thinks

From the things I have readheard Glocks are always knocked because of the
trigger safety  They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly

Harder than what  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way
so it cant be harder than revolvers

Every article that I have read cant be wrong about the damn thing

Sure they can  Moreover we know now that Kratz sample is
unrepresentative  We can look at the reasoning  It is basically
these Glocks are dangerous because theyre not like my 1911SW third
generation  Part of that is true but since those same people dont
claim that revolvers which share the relevant property are
dangerous we see that the argument fails

me to quote my sources because I dont keep a ton of gun magazines andor

Why would I care  Im not looking for more bogus reasoning

recguns articles laying around  Boy you cant make a simple statement on
here without someone getting right on your ass

One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone
getting right on your ass  One merely has to make accurate simple
statements  Then you get attaboys by mail and publically

Accuracy is a severe burden but most of us manage it
