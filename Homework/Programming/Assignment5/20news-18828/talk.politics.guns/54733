Public health experts will tell you that you are far more likely
have your gun stolen use it yourself on a family member or
have it used on you than you are to use it on an actual criminal

Actually they wont  What theyll tell you is that if you add up the
number of suicides murders of one drug dealer by another legit
selfdefenses of a battered spouse and so on youll end up with a
number that is much larger than the number of selfdefense killings
against strangers committed in the bedroom  BTW  they didnt
honestly count the latter either but lets not quibble  They
try to claim that comparison is between the costs of selfdefense
and the benefits but theyre wrong

This comparison doesnt measure the costs of selfdefense and it
doesnt measure the benefits either  For example the goal is not to
kill the attacker whatever your relationship to him but to stop him
While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of
stops it isnt equal

Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation
is either lying or
