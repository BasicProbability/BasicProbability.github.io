Subject Government  biggest cult leader

Look folks I dont know what happened in Waco  I do not claim the BDs are  
angels I never did  Koresh may very well be the devil incarnate  I just  
dont know  But I do know that I must question any single source of  
information such as we have here  And I must question even harder given that  
it is single source at the insistance of that very government  What ever else  
happened at WACO that is perhaps the biggest evil done  And even more so in  
light of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the  
state officials

But what I really dont understand is the hoards of devoted government  
worshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong  They  
are fanatic to the point of making things up such as Brents microwave oven  
disclaim of the BDs using fire for food heating  

I am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power Koresh  
held over the BDs and the demonstrated power the government holds over those  
rapid apologists
