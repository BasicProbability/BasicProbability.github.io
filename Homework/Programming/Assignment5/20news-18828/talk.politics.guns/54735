In article C5yypoEI2dscomsadesyde hallamdscomsadesyde Phill HallamBaker writes

 No Frank Crarys arguments are based on the assumption that most people
 are sane normal people tpg disproves this of gun owners USEnet as a whole
 disproves it of humanity as a whole

Heavens  Everybody but Phill is out of step

 We now have proof positive that guns dont make you safer Buy a lot of
 guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the FBI to burn
 down your house See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
 to support gun control

Once again Phill lets us all know that might makes right  but ONLY for
the allsacred government
