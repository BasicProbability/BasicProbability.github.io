                        The Ballad of David Koresh
  
At Concord and at Waco
the tyrants minions failed
Though they all died in the fire
Koreshs people have prevailed 

Good irony  The Waco finale was on April 19 Patriots Day
On that day 218 years earlier the militias of Concord Mass
and other nearby towns repelled a guncontrol raid by the
thencurrent Colonial government
