 Go to hell Im no government  following fanatic Your sweeping
 generalizations evince your own ignorance 

Eloquently if somewhat shrilly put  

 What were they supposed to do  Just let him be 

Well why not

 Fuck him Fuck the ATF too They shouldve done it right
 the first time

You have a way with words  And you sure get shrill on cue
