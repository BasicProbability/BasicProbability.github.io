  napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it
 
 for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas  Everyone now claims 
 that it was for cooking  Stop and think about this
 
 This whole thread is rediculous  Who cares if they had a stove going
 or not  Does it matter if they had a stove burning or lanterns
 burning or candles burning or someone smoking etc etc etc  The
 premise is that the FBI was filling the house with napalm so that it
 would catch fire  This is crazy  FBI was NOT PUMPING NAPALM into the
 Davidians home  You will have to have pretty damn strong evidence to
 convince me of that
 
 I can believe mass suicidemurder by Koresh  I can believe an
 accident by the Davidians  I can believe an accident by the FBI  I
 can easily believe mass stupidity on all sides but I can not believe
 that the FBI lit this fire intentionally  No way
 

I tend to agree but I would like a better explanation of why the FBI stopped  
the firetrucks at the gate  I saw this in realtime  It concerns me that the  
FBI appeared to not be too interested in stopping the fire after it started  
and actually started flying hueys around the compound which had to add in some  
small part to the winds driving the fire
