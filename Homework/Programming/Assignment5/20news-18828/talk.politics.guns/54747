 Im sick to my stomach as I write this  The BD compound
 is on fire and will burn to the ground in minutes
I used exactly this oneword reply to suggest a likely ending to
the siege several weeks ago But like Masada this wasnt entirely
a government action The defenders held out as long as they could
and then killed themselves their families and their children 
rather than surrender Israel calls the action of the Zelots
heroic and trains their army to follow this example Now that 
someone has repeated this action in modern times what do we call it

Liberals and supporters of Clinton say that costs made the action 
necessary
