  You seem to make two points  No one ultimately oversees the federal  
agencies  
  you mention and since Koresh apparently has a different view point from  
your  
  Baptist upbringing then he is not worthy of protection from religious  
  persecution  As to being the Messiah is not Christ within us all
  
  Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion
  
  Baptists are a cult two BTW under most of the definitions in the  
dictionary  
  of cult
  
 
 Ive yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambells soup
 and M16sAR15s and bangingmarrying thirteen yuear olds 

I dont recall saying Baptists do any of that  Though I suppose some do  And  
none of them are listed in the dictionary as characteristics of a cult  My  
mother stockpiled Campbells soup when it was on sale  

 Youre a sorry
 son of a bitch if you cant draw a distinction between these two things

You are an intolerent foulmouthed human  You sound like you are ready to  
join the KKK or neonazis with a narrow mind like yours

 People like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
 who arent deserved of it Get a life and chill on the paranoia
 

Far from it I defend the rights of anyone to be different under our  
constitution which was formed in part to protect religious cults which had  
been persecuted in England before migrating here to be free  You are the one  
endangering our constitution
