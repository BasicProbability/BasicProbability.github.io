I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they 
intended to do orchestrated character assassination noise torture and
a holocaust would never have come to pass

Do you know what a noknock search with grenades is

Once again Koresh closed the door on an agent with a search warrant
and the door was then perforated by a rain of bullets from the
inside

They shot first


 
  The Koresh cult standoff is over  may his victims Recquiescat in Pace 
                                                                           
                     the above is a netmoment of silence
