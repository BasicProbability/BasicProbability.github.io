    Yeah as information trickles in funny how that works

Funny yeah funny how you didnt wait for the FBI spokesdroid 
latest reversal of facts before proclaiming the BDs burned
themselves to death

If you wont believe anything the government says and the press
is not reliable according to the same logic then what do you base
your statements on  Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose
of paranoia

It is not a matter of disbelief but a matter of which of their constantly
and radically changing stories we are to believe
