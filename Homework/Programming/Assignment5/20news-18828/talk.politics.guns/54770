 Odd terminology  Thats what one says when you know a fire is planned  
not 
 when one occurs by accident
 

Its also what you say when youre waiting for the end to come in a 
fiery apocalypsejust a thought

Personally if the fire was set by either side I wonder about the
timing  If Koresh  Co set the fires why wait through six hours of
wallbashing and teargassing before starting was there anything new
that happened just around that point  Similarly if the FBI were going
to torch the place and fake it of course why wait so long wouldnt
it be more reasonable to believe the BDs would set the fire early
after the assault began  

The most plausible to me explaination is that of an accidental starting
of the fire by the tanks  Among other things I say that because I
was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter
watching from a distance of course said that it looked like at least
one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously
Specifically he said that one tank apparently was halfway half of
the tanks lenght into the building where it previously had only been 
penetrating a few feet

reserving judgement
