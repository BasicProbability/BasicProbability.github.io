Subject Re FBI Directors Statement on Waco Standoff

 Oh  How about the press  If the BATF  FBI were going to shoot people
 leaving a burning building dont you think they would get rid of the
 press first

Oh you mean something like moving the press back to a single
location 2 miles away from the compound  The press was allowing

That doesnt count as getting rid of the press  Getting rid of the press
would mean getting them far enough away so that they wouldnt be able to
see what is going on
