Subject Re guns in backcountry no thanks

wrong about the  whole gunsforprotection mindset it ignores the
systemic effects of cumulative individual actions  If you want fire
insurance on your house thats prudent and it has no effect on me but
if you and a bunch of other paranoids are packing handguns in the
backcountry it makes me and anyone else who doesnt chose to protect
himself in this manner pretty fking nervous 

Why  If youre not a threat youre not affected at all

I mean take this to its logical conclusion suppose we all carried
handguns all the time for protection from all the other people
carrying handguns Would we collectively be or feel safer Hell no
Wed feel a lot more insecure

Why  I note that the available psych info says that feelings of
security INCREASE  The victimization stats say that that increase
is rational

Another systemic effect of all the good people protecting themselves
is that the bad people are going to modify their behavior in
response

Yes they are but how

theyre going to be much itchier and much more willing to
kill people in the course of routine muggings if they think their

Nope  that doesnt happen  Instead the switch among those who
change behaviors to property crimes  Thats an improvement even if
the economic take is unchanged  Sure  not everyone switches but
they were killing before
