Subject Re Backcountry Confidence

	The rest of us fall in the middle  There IS too much violent
crime in the US but turning the whole country into an oldtime
Dodge City ref to American Old West is not the way

Thats an interesting statement  Theres quite a difference between
Hollywoods Old West and the real one  Yes there were drunks
saloons mining camps and thugs  However as McGrath showed the
thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another  McGrath claims that
this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who
insisted on getting into a fight got his way even if he lost while
they really did care when thugs preyed on others

citizens should be able to own weapons but we see no sense in some
types

We havent figured out that those distinctions dont actually work
Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934  Said regulation
is both perfect legally owned machine guns arent ever used
criminally and a complete waste of time the criminal use of machine
guns hasnt change at all  The result  were now arguing about
guns that LOOK like machine guns but are no different than other
guns
