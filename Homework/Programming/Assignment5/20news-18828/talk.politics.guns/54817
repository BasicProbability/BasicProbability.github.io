Dillon has published a letter in the Blue Press telling people
How to Bankrupt HCI by requesting information from them

Last time this idea went around in recguns a couple of people
said that HCI counts all information requestors as members

Can anyone confirm or deny this

If true whats the impact of HCI getting a few thousand new
members

Last I heard HCI had something like 250K members to the NRAs 3 million
If true and they want to play duelling mandates well
