Perhaps you consider that Hitler was not responsible for the Holocaust 
since the allies could have done more to stop him

Attention please

According to the rules of usenet flame wars once a discussion degenerates
to the point where Hitler is mentioned that flame war may be declared
ended  I would like to take this opportunity to do that now  Clearly
further discussion is not useful with the current set of facts and the
current name calling and invocation of Hitlers name is not productive even
by the standards of usenet talk groups

If you must continue please dont discuss this in misclegal  Its not
about the law  If you would like to discuss the law as it applies to the
Waco incident please ask questions of the form if the FBI started the
fire accidentally who would be legally responsible for the deaths

Note that followups are set not to include misclegal
