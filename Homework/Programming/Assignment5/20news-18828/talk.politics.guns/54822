Thats another sad thing  Id expect this sort of shit from the BATF
But Im goddamn disappointed in the FBI  They used to be professionals

Apparently you are unfamiliar with the history of the FBI You might
try looking up articles from the 70s on the FBIs Cointelpro
operation for starters

The US Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens  Just as with a garrotte the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom the more the government tightens its stranglehold The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom
