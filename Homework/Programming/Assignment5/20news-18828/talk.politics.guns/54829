Subject Re Ban All Firearms

   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollarpound area  It would not
   be economic to smuggle them in  All production would have to be
   local  There are not all that many people who have both the skill
   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch
   Highranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such but
   the average person and average thug would be lucky to get a zipgun
    and would pay through the nose for it

Good point you make  However a zip gun by definition is a crude
homemade guncertainly not something capable of sustained accurate
fire but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun  Recall
the tiny singleshot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for
use by partisans  They were essentially wellmade zipguns incapable of
effective fire beyond a few feet  But they were useful as a means of
killing German soldiers for their guns

Also note that the crowdpleasin favorite the Sten gun was
specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible
The points been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel
tubing hand tools and a welder

I still think that while the point is good I think theres a difference
between marijuana and firearms in that quality marijuana can be grown
locally theres no need to import the stuff  If guns are banned I
think the demand for real guns will be sufficient to make smuggling
economically feasible thus rendering a ban moot  In any case the
result would be the samepeople who arent criminals wont have
firearms and bad guys will continue to have access to them one way
or another  And I dont see that as a necessary situation
