Subject Re Need info on 431 and suicide for refutation

Entropic Destroyer lokiaccanmsuedu wrote

 I have seen these numbers quoted before and I have seen very specific
 refutation of them quoted as well  If someone will be so kind as to
 email the relevant information I will write a letter to the editor of
 the Co Daily which might get published and send a copy to USNWR as
 well

Thanks to all who responded  The letter has been written making liberal
use of info provided by various netfolks and handed to the paper  Ill
post if it gets into the paper

Dan
