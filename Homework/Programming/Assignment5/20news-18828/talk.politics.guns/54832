Subject Re guns in backcountry no thanks


Hi

In Canada any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed I think its a
small metal tag thats placed over the trigger  The net result of this is
that you cant use a gun to protect yourself from bears or psychos in the
National Parks  Instead one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country and take the appropriate precautions

I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer
to Nature that they are a part of Nature and as such have to deal with
nature on its own terms
