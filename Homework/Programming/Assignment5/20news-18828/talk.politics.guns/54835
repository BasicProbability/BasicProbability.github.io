Subject Re BATF initiating violence sources

In article 1r49aj98chpchaserosehpcom khprndrosehpcom Steve Kao writes

Ive long since lost any newspaper or magazine article that mentions how
the BATF said they tossed a grenade instead of knocked on the door to
serve the search warrant on the BD compound  Does anyone have any
references  Im just looking for periodicalsnewspapers and dates  A
copy of the article is not needed but I wouldnt mind seeing it
Posting here or email is fine

       The Associated Press had an article on Monday March 1 I believe
which quoted witnesses as describing BATF agents throwing grenades prior
to any gunfire on the part of the Davidians

       It was among the first of a crop of different mutually exclusive
descriptions
