Subject Re Change of name 

We all know what a quisling is right
Obviously we dont
Vidkun Quisling is known to be a traitor in Norway not a censor
If I have betrayed my country Norway bescause I implied that som of 
you jumped to conclusionssound a little paranoid then I think there
is a LOT of quislings in Norway

Perhaps I wasnt sufficiently clear  I was NOT accusing YOU of being
a quisling  The quislings are in our own US government throwing
away the peoples right to keep and bear arms  at least thats
where the ones that I INTENDED to refer to are  I figured that people
on this newsgroup would interpret that as intended but obviously
something of my intent got lost
