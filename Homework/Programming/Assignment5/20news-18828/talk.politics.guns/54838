Subject Re BATF  FBI Do Right Thing in Waco

In article 1993Apr212235412353gnvifasufledu jrmgnvifasufledu writes
If the BATF and FBI have become latterday Gestapo then they have
become that way because WE have desired them to be so We get to
vote on laws and on the lawmakers 
	I keep hearing people say this  It assumes that we at some point
	had a choice at the ballot box Vote yes or no I want the FBI
	and BATF to become latterday Gestapos  That just isnt so
	The process is far more complex  We do not have direct control over
	the bureaucracy  When we evaluate our representatives we dont often
	know what their contribution is to the wayward direction of the
	federal law enforcement bureacracy  To assert that we got what
	we wanted is absurd  

Waco was an encapsulation of the AllAmerican experience  religious
fanaticism militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence Dont
blame it on them the FBI and BATF They were just acting within
the parameters we have set over the years We made them We ARE them
	Oh good I feel much better now   

	By the way do you have a plan for getting us out of this mess we
	are in
