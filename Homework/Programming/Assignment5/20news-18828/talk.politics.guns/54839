	If there was a large propane tank and it was breached dont 
	you think that there would be an identifiable explosion

From what I saw of the videotape there was an explosion which looked
more like one due to propane rather than official version
ammunition

	I would agree that a propane explosion is as likely as an
	ammunitionexplosives blast My question was directed to the
	person who claimed that the propane tank was likely ruptured
	by the tank before or just as the fire started If that were 
	true shouldnt the explosion have happened very soon after 
	the fires started	


	The only evidence that exists right now at least what we know
	about is various claims and counter claims Im waiting until
	the hard evidence is released What about you

If only we could be certain that the hard evidence will be released

	The FBI has made such a fuss over the videotapes and other
	evidence that they have to release something sooner or
	later Its going to happen and well get to see for
	ourselves

	Often law enforcement agencies will withold evidence from
	public view until the investigation is over
