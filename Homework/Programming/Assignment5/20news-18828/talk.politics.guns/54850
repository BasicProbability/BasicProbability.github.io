 According to WNCI 979 FM radio this morning Dayton Ohio is operating a
 gun buy back  They are giving 50 for every functional gun turned in
 They ran out of money in one day and are now passing out 50 vouchers of
 some sort  They are looking for more funds to keep operating  Another
 mediaevent brought to you by HCI

 Is there something similar progun people can do   For example pay 100
 to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm   Sounds a bit
 tacky but hey whatever works

How about a gun buybackcharity  Get some sponsors to fund the
purchase of used firearms have a gunsmith check them over and give
or sell them at a low price to poor persons wishing to own firearms 
OK you guys can work out the details of who is needy etc
