  Endless remarks of how the Davidians could have surrendered deleted
 
If they had lived a quiet religious life as they claimed there would
have been no raid no siege and no deaths  Instead they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID if not
IRRATIONAL  The first was to stockpile weapons  The second was to
shoot federal agents  The third was to stay inside

  If they had been quiet there would have been no deaths  I thought thier
neighbors said that the Davidians never bothered them  Oh well that couldnt
have been your point then  

  If they hadnt been stockpiling weapons then the ATF wouldnt have felt 
threatened and had to move in  Heres a newsflash  It isnt illegal to
own more than one firearm  It isnt even illegal to own lots of firearms
 
  They shot federales  The feds shot them too  

  How about that staying inside thing  Heres another newsflash  sometimes
the government does nasty things to you that you dont deserve  Since
they were so nice to the Davidians the first time round I can see why
the Davidians didnt surrender so easily especially because they were
expecting the end of the world
