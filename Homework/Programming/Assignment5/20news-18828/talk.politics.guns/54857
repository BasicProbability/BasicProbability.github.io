 I predict that the outcome of the study of what went wrong with the
 Federal Assault in Waco will result in future assaults of that type
 being conducted as fullscale military operations with explicit
 shoottokill directives
 
 You mean they arent already Could have fooled me
 
  
                             REMEMBER WACO
      Who will the government decide to murder next Maybe you
 Opinions are mine I dont care if you blame the University or the State
 
 Well it seems we dont learn the lessons of history do we
 
 I was hoping that Kent State taught us a lesson
 
 Apparently not
 
 Apparently the government will murder anyone they choose to still
 

Hmm For more recent lesson what about that little square in China

Another lesson might be the one repeated every year in Tibet

And of course theres always El Salvador

And the beat goes on and on     

MESSAGES FROM GOD  GET OFF YOUR ASS  DONT TRUST THE
GOVERNMENT  AT ANY TIME  FOR ANY REASON  THE SCREAMING MAN
