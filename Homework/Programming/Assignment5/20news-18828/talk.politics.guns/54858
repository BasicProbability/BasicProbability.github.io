 What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF If they would of
 had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the
 compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened
The BATF is a part of the dept of treasury not justice  If they needed
to assault a place they could just do like the IRS doescall in the
federal marshalls service

The IRS doesnt need to rely on the Federal Marshalls Services the
IRS has its own Swat teams I saw a picture of one in an article on
the IRS in some magazine or other

The US Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens  Just as with a garrotte the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom the more the government tightens its stranglehold The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom
