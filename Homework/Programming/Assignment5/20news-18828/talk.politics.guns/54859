Subject Re BDs did themselvesyoure all paranoid freaks


In a previous article   says

Freed om of Religion has absolutely nothing to do with building a small
arsenal and grooming 10year old children to be your wife Ill come out
as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals Oh OK David


        Interesting that Janet Reno has publically announced that
        we need steal ourselves for more Wacos  I wonder if I can
        get the gasoline concession


I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because
he grew up inside the cult and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego


     Yup  Kill that bastard


This was no MOVE fuckup A helicoptor was thermalimaging the compound



     Ah yes  The ILLEGAL helicopter searchign for the nonexistent
     PCP lab  I remember it well even if the media  and yall  tell
     me I dont  Call me Winston

that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously
There were no CS CANISTERS a specially modified Abrams was pupming the


      Ahhh yes  The nonexistent canisters  Call me Winston again


stuff in No chance of starting a fire there Kerosene lamps Maybe one
but not three fires No way Koresh wasnt just talking out of his ass I
expected this to happen

     I did too but for different reasons  The FBI has a habit of burning
     up people in fortified areas


Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder He had 50 days I think this was
coming the whole time He didnt even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the CS seige He put them up into the tower
to die Fuck all of you Big Brother paranoid freaks The only good thing
to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to
attract some of the more rootless members of our society


      Yup  Good  Dead  YEAH   Maybe Janet will do some more just
      like shes promis er WARNED us about

      Like I told yall before  I would SERIOUSLY consider the following

        Get your passport in order now
        Consider overseas options for your savings
