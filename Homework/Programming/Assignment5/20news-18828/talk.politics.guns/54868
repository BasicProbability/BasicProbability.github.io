 Hear hear Id also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
 that multiple victims were found shot in the head and in positions
 inconsistent with fire victims It is simply too early to draw conclusions
 either way about this nasty incident but I tend to believe the government
 side                                     
 
  

At least youre consistent  Im sure the highly propagandized Germans
tended to believe their governments version too in the thirties and
forties as those different highly demonized Jewish cultists met
their fate  Always trust your government
