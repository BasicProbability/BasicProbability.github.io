In article 1993Apr2102130125113rnodehuborg ndallenrnodehuborg Nigel Allen writes
 Here is a press release from the White House

      Number one that there was a limit to how long the
 federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
 quality and intensity of coverage by experts there  

Lucky they brought the situation to a prompt resolution before they had to 
turn things over to the amateurs

 They might be needed in other parts of the country

God help us all
