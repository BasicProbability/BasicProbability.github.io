Yknow when the right to bear arms was invented 

It wasnt invented but was supposed by the writers of the Constitution
to be a universal preexisting right Howsomever

all we had to worry about was the shotgun and pistol 

Hmmm  You need to spend some time in a library son

When the Bill of Rights was written in addition to the muzzleloading
shotgun and pistol you mention we had

  rifles in calibers ranging from around 30 to 69 caliber and up
  cannon with various different projectiles to choose from and owned
   by civilians
  breechloading rifles

In addition semiautomatic and fullautomatic firearms had been patented
andor demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so

Now we have to worry about drivebys
with Uzis sparaying the entire neighborhood with bullets

Sounds good  Any refererences to this actually happening or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
Uzi semi or fullauto

Just because someting was good once does not mean it will be forever

Until the root conditions that justified it go away criminal behavior
either private or government which should be defended against theres
no reason it should go away

 

 Some things are too important not to give away      
 to everybody else and have none left for yourself
