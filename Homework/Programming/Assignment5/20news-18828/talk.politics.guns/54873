I dont remember the figures EXACTLY but there were about 3500 deaths in Texas
in 1991 that was caused by guns

That includes suicides  Since it has been shown in other countries that
suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for
doing oneself in studies include some donepublished in Japan Canada
Austria Norway suicides ought not be included in the count

If this is done the number of vehiclerelated deaths greatly exceeds that
of firearmsrelated deaths in Texas

I should not suffer because of others

Certainly not

We all agree on this one BUT we also live in a sociaty and therefor
well have to give up SOME of our freedom Note the 

Why  Unless its doing something that directly hurts someone else whats
the point  Otherwise youd better stop operating all motor vehicles since
the price of operating them greatly exceeds the cost in lives of firearms

One state dont remember which Texas tried to impose a rule that you could
only buy ONE gun each MONTH Think you all know what happened

WEll its been done at least twice  South North Carolina did it a few
years backand watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country
rise quite a bit

Virginia just passed the lawno word yet on what the results will be but
Id be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates wont be one of them

I respect the right to defend yourself but that right should not inflict on
other people

Selfdefense doesnt inflict on other people except perhaps the criminal
whos tried to do you damage and maybe indirectly on future potential victims
who might not become victims



 

 Some things are too important not to give away      
 to everybody else and have none left for yourself
