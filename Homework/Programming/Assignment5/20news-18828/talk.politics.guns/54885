Do you think a 200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government
with 100 armed men in trailers orchestrated character assassination noise
torture and a holocaust

I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they 
intended to do orchestrated character assassination noise torture and
a holocaust would never have come to pass

The BDs killed members of the BATF on the first day Orchestrated character
assassination and noise torture seem like a small retribution  The use
of tanks is quesionable however
