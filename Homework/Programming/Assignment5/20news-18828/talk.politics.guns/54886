 Im NOT trying to censor this or any newsgroup Im just trying to
 give some hints about OTHER newsgroups
 Doesnt this belong to altconspiracy 

Drop three billiard balls on a ramp and they all roll in the same
direction  Pour some blood into the sea and sharks will converge
from miles around  Throw a pebble at one starling and all 200 will
depart

Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no
actual conspiracy is required

Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation and he
quickly covers his ass

This too is completely natural

 About Waco
 It looks to me as the BATF and FBI cant handle situations like this

It looks that way to me too  But you have to understand that its NOT 
the first time they have instigated raids like these  The most recent
one ALSO ended up in a long standoff but it wasnt quite as public
as this one and they didnt kill quite as many people  Maybe this 
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
residences in this manner  But probably not

 The way it went reminds me of stun bomb beeing dropped on a house
 in LA from a helicopter Whole block went up in flames 5 died

I assume youre talking about Philadelphia

 It doesnt HAVE to be a conspiracy MAYBE they just screwed up 

If youre a fan of conspiracies the time to make that batch of
popcorn is AFTER the screwup when its time for the coverup
