Subject Re text of White House announcement and QAs on clipper chip encryption


For those who didnt figure it out the below message was a reply to another
in scicrypt for which the poster put tpg in the FollowupTo line I
didnt notice that Apologies to those who were confused

The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages

However I dont wish to enter into this discussion here as it will be yet
another rehearsal of a longtired set of arguments Suffice it to say that I
disagree both with the interpretation of wellregulated in the Second
Amendment offered by gun lovers and what I think to be their distortion of
the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers My Webster and my
reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control
and disciplined and not of good marksmanship I think the latter a
special interest pleading No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference
in which well regulated unambiguously meant of good marksmanship and
not under controldisciplined etc

Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not
an arming everyone clause Others are welcome to disagree as I know many
do and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular
forum

To avoid flames or unproductive rehashings I note that Ive come in here
to post this one message just to clarify the one below Im now outta here
again though Im available via email

Though I agree this is not the place to discuss guns I note in passing that
a number of gun apologists seem to have ignored the words well regulated
in their distorted interpretations of the Second Amendment
