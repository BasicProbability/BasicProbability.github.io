Subject Need info on Waco Machineguns

A really sad oped appeared in my schools newpaper today  It
claimed that fullauto weapons are illegal in the US
I understand that fullauto weapons made and registered before
May 19 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states  Is
Texas one of those states

Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been 
killed by legal fullauto weapons in the US

And finally I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest
of facts on the Waco incident  In particular I would like a source
for the FBIBATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab and
information on the beginning of the raid specifically BATF
lies

I am also interested in past BATF noknock warrents which have lead
to personal and property damage against innocent citizens

I intend to put together a reply to this oped very soon  The author
of the piece states he wants to work for the BATF  gack
