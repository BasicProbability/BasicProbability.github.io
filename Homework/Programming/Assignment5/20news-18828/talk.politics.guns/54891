Hey guys  Youre absolutely correct and well on the way to winning
this battle  and losing the war  Yes there are serious philosophical
flaws in HR 1276  Technical ones too  howd you like to sue the Feds
lose and have to pay their reasonable Attorneys fee      

Still I have one basic question  compared to what weve got is HR 1276
a better or b worse  This one shouldnt even take you three guesses

If theres a good enough show of support for HR 1276 maybe for a change
we could be the ones saying its a reasonable first step 

The 2nd Amendment is about sovereignty not duck hunting
