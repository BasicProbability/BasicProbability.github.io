 Yet the FBI mouthpiece at this afternoons press conference characterized
 the quantity of CS gas pumped into the building as massive and speculated
 that after a few hours of exposure any Davidian gas masks would become
 useless
 
 Does this sound not harmful to you

Hm  A previous poster argued that the fact that the BDs did not rush to
escape the burning building indicated that it was they and not any of the
government actions that started the fire  On the other hand I wonder if
with a face full of massive amounts of CS I would be able to escape
a burning tinderbox like that ranch house assuming my best efforts

Imagine you have been under seige for almost two months by an enemy which you
believe wants to kill you  Suddenly they pump tear gas into your building and
punch holes in it with tanks  Then a fire breaks out  Do you run outside to
be slaughtered or stay and face your fate

Check Ethiopia vs Italy in WWII for some answers to that question
