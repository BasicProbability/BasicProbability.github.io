The Houston Chronicle last Thursday maybe Wednesday said that
the interior of walls had been covered with hay bales to help
protect against bullets  Many of you know how fast dry hay
burns

This is all terribly interesting but it doesnt belong in misclegal
Take it elsewhere please

 
        Have you hugged your common nucleus of operative fact today
