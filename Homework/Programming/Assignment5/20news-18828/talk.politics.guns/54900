Subject More on stupid media

I just heard on CNN that the Texas Rangers found an M60 machine gun
in the BD compound Rubble  The newscaster called this a new hitech
military weapon  HA HA  I would bet that it is that Rock Armory
M60 semiauto or that it was leagally owned and the tax was paid

What year was the M60 patented

Just showing you how the media is twisting the facts
Josh
