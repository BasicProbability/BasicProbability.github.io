The Houston Chronicle last Thursday maybe Wednesday said that
the interior of walls had been covered with hay bales to help
protect against bullets  Many of you know how fast dry hay
burns

This is all terribly interesting but it doesnt belong in misclegal
Take it elsewhere please


But of course it does   Its certainly a legal matter  If its not a
legal matter that interest you you may simply put it in your kill
file 

Seeeeee Ya  turmoilhalcyoncom   FUCK THE POLICE
