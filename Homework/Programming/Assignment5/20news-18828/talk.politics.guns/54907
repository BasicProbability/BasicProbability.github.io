 Boston Globe Wednesday April 21 1993

 LIttle in the way of rationality could be expected from Koresh a 
 selfconfessed sinner without equal

funny if Koresh did say that he was quoting St Paul of course 
the early Christians were persecuted too if Koresh is a loony 
because he quotes the Bible how long is it before mainstream 
Christians become the target of the FBIs loving care and attention
