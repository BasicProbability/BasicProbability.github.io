Has anyone in US heard anything similar or are US government
spindoctors censoring such information

The BBC news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died
were british citizens
 
The BBC are also reporting that bodies of BD members were found
with bullet wounds in a manner that suggests they may have been shot
attempting to leave the compound during the fire

Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes Bullets go flying every
where IMHO these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines 
went up A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make so Ill wait for an
autopsy to determine if they were shot first 

Either way theyre all dead and the FBI  Atty Gen Vampria are still
responable
