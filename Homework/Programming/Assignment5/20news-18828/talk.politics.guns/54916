 Do you think a 200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government
 with 100 armed men in trailers orchestrated character assassination noise
 torture and a holocaust
 
 I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they 
 intended to do orchestrated character assassination noise torture and
 a holocaust would never have come to pass
 
 The BDs killed members of the BATF on the first day Orchestrated character
 assassination and noise torture seem like a small retribution  

Does the phrase Innocent until proven guilty have ANY meaning anymore

 The use
 of tanks is quesionable however
