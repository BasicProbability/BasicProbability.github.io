Subject WACO suicide

Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have 
wondered If it wasnt suicide why did so few get out  The 
answer is now available  the gas the government had been pouring
in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the
chemical weapons treaty

The US had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in
wartime but used it in peacetime against civilians including 
nnocent children

For confirmation see Fridays CLINTONAM press briefing by George
Stephanopoulous posted in altnewsmedia and other locations
When questioned about it his reply was that the treaty did
not forbid its internal use by law enforcement agencies
