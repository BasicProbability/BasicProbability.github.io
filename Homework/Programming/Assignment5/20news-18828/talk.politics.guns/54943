Come on   A gun kills people  

Rather people kill people with guns  The sad truth is sometimes that is
good or at least better than the alternative

But lets ignore guns for defence andor crime and look at gun accidents

Ok  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year 1 and the
number has been in decline since early this century 2  Most of these
accidents involve rifles or shot guns not handguns


But seriously a gun is designed to fire a bullet   This is not so you
can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range

In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that 
The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel a semiauto 022 caliber
handgun was designed to kill or hurt people even for self defense
would Im sure come as a surprise to its designer  It certainly isnt
why I have it  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it
and might even kill them but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to
kill people

This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show
someone  that you have a gun and they go Gee perhaps I should leave

In fact that is what happens most of the time  Most self defensive uses
of firearms dont involve firing any shots  Most criminals would prefer
not to be shot and will go to some effort not to be including doing what
you say when you point a gun at them

If you were called on to design a tool that could be easily carried to
immediately stop someone attacking you what would it be  A handgun is
about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work
the best3

No you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human
body and hurt them  Not a tough concept to swallow for most

Certainly no one argues that handguns of the type we are discussing
arent deadly weapons  However it simply isnt true to say that all of
them were designed to kill people  Moreover what exactly is wrong with
having deadly weapons  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to
use deadly force eg in self defense  I consider it not just my right
but my duty to defend myself and my family and that includes having and
knowing how to use the tools to do that

The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear
arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in
government
	 T Jefferson

I think what Jefferson said is still true

And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes
off into the wrong fleshy target

Not very often compared to other use3

Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife

This isnt that common either at least when compared to other uses  It is
very rare that a nonviolent person will suddenly getpissed and kill
someone gun or not  In most cases the people who murder have long
histories of violence  If you have good reason to believe that these
people wouldnt kill if they didnt have a gun feel free to present it

Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to
kill things  Right

Right but there are times when killing things is called for  I hope I
never have to shoot a person but Ive had to kill a number of animals from
rodents to cows and when I do I dont want them to suffer any more than
is necessary  I prefer they die instantly but failing that I want them
to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot and failing that
I dont want them to go fast or far  I try to choose the best weapon and
ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal Im
after but it doesnt always work as I plan  Without belaboring the point
people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns
particularly handguns havent used them much for that purpose

for almost sixty years In 1932 the accidental deaths by firearm per 
1000000 people was 2403 In 1987 it was 574 The decline has been 
steady consistent and a fairly straight line when plotted At the rate 
of the last sixty years it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD

CONCLUSION

Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over 
sixty years despite rising percapita gun ownership
