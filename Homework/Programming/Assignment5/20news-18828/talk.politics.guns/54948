 Has anyone in US heard anything similar or are US government
 spindoctors censoring such information
 
 The BBC news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died
 were british citizens
  
 The BBC are also reporting that bodies of BD members were found
 with bullet wounds in a manner that suggests they may have been shot
 attempting to leave the compound during the fire
  
 There is a possibility that these are the bodies of people killed during
 the initial shootout

 Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes Bullets go flying  
every
 where IMHO these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines 
 went up A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make so Ill wait for an
 autopsy to determine if they were shot first 
 
 
I would doubt bullets would go flying  There is no particular force to make  
the bullet leave the scene of a cartridge going off outside of a barrel  The  
brass shell would burst too soon to give the bullet any real velocity  I  
wouldnt want to be near it but I do not think bullet wounds would result   
Shrapnel wounds would be more likely
 
At least this is my understanding

Not necessarily If the body had been denatured cooked or dehydrated due
to the heat a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate
In fire aftermaths bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of
meat with little effort Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up
such scenes 

As such if the body had been suitably cooked a bullet comming from a
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the
time of death or much later unless you were trained to look for the
evidence Texas Rangers are not pathologists 


 
 Either way theyre all dead and the FBI  Atty Gen Vampria are still
 responsable
 
Yep at least in large part
