people are getting killed by gang violence every day  Every single day I hear
about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the weapons
that are being confiscated

Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M16
from an AR15  That he can see the difference between a semiauto and
a fullauto UZI  That he can see the difference between the various
versions some fullauto some semiauto only of the M119

Well let me see  UZI no  M119 no  M16AR15 maybe  I remember there
being a selector swtich on the AR15  If I remember correctly please correct
me if Im wrong the switch would set to an off position or an on position
because the gun AR15 is semiautomatic  Wouldnt the M16 have a position
for semiauto fire and fullauto fire or maybe 3 round bursts  If this is
correct wouldnt it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone  Of course
if the AR15 were modified to fullauto fire I wouldnt think it would be that
easy but Im talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR15 and M16
How about the other guns  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
semiauto and fullyauto fire

If so Id love to hear the details if only because theyll demonstrate
that Kratz is blowing smoke

Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like
another gun yet have very different properties and that thats
quite common

Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out
that my parents car wasnt much like Richard Pettys even though it
looked just like it except for the paint job  Things must have been
different with Kratz

Actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out
as Richard Petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the 
driveway 

Sure its on TV but why does that make a difference

No it doesnt but thats irrelevant  If visual inspection of the
outside worked TV would be acceptable but since it doesnt the fact
that its just as good as seeing in person doesnt mean much

Well what about what I said above  If that is correct I guess TV would be
acceptable if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower 
receiver of the AR15M16

andy gave Kratz a chance to back down on this in private

Jason Kratz  didnt take andys offer to back down in private
