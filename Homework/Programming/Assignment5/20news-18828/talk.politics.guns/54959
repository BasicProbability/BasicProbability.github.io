More than someone who would not release children from the compound

I suppose its too late now but the repeated use of the word
release is peculiar  Lets say you and your family are besieged
in your home by some people with tanks helicopters and automatic
weapons  They give you a break from the amplified sounds of dying
rabbits to blare You in there  Release the children and theyll
be perfectly all right  Stipulate on top of that that you may not
have your epistemology entirely in order  Is it entirely surprising
that the Branch Davidians were reluctant to release their children
into FBI custody
