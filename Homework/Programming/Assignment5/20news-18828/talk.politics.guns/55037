   Minor quibble  The assualt and it was one began near dawn  The fire did
 not break out for several hours  
 	Minor quibble back at you  I am in the same general area as
 	the Koresh compound and I can tell you that the air was quite
 	chilly that morning especially with the high winds that
 	were blowing Of course the swiss cheese walls made it
 	even worse 

  You are correct WRT the idea of some heating being nice that morning  But 
part of that line was also for the guy who said minutes later the fires
started  I did forget how cool it was that day

 Those choppers flying around didnt make the wind any more still either

  When you got 3040 mph winds swinging across the Texas plain a couple of
Hueys dont add one whole hell of a lot
