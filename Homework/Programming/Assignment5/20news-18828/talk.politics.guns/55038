2 Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome

	This I doubt  While I question the ATFs initial raid I believe
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single
exception of the psychological warfare by blaring music etc  I think
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome

  BUT  Suppose they had waited  The WORST outcome would have been the
one that actually did  But with the FBIATF just standing there watching
instead of being a part of the problem  It then would have been very clear
exactly who was at fault then rather than the way it turned out

  AND that would have been the WORST case  The best would have been they
finally get hungry and come out  Possiblelikely  Well the alternative was
worse

One other point Im no fan of Janet Reno but I do like the way she had the
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility  Seems like the waffle boy
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue

	Which is actually rather refreshing nowadays  Most of the time the
higherups claim I dont remember or I had no involvement  

  But what does it matter  Why say I dont remember when it doesnt
make any difference  Altho the clintonettes have been pretty good at lying
when it wasnt necessary they didnt do it this time  But it wasnt 
necessary  claiming full responsibility is a totall meaningless gesture
Symbolism over substance  again  

  Ive offered to take full responsibility  When do they pay me the big
bucks the AG is making
