 However it was the Branch
 Davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their  
savior 
 yeah right budy boy because he had brainwashed them into believing  
that 
 what ever he says is the truth even if means that they are to give up  
their
 lives for HIS cause  

Tolerent arent we  Theirs was hardly the first faithsectcult 
to espouse this type of belief

 Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATFs
 who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out this was 50 days to many for me  
and
 for many of the rest of the US 

I keep hearing this and while Ill agree that he should have come
out legally that was his best option he didnt and as far as I know
there is no legal provision for were tired of this shit lets just
kick some ass

So I have a question for you here goes

I come up to you and point a gun at you saying Im going to count
to ten if you arent standing on your head by then Ill kill you
You believe that standing on your head is the road to damnation so
you dont do it
12345678910BANG  You are now dead  Is it my
fault for shooting you or youre fault for being shot
Koresh wouldnt stand on his head
