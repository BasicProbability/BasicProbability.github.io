On the subject of CSCNtear gas when I received my initial introduction to
tear gas the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit  If
there had been anything in the way corners to negotiate doors to open or 
any other obstacles to movement I would have had a difficult time exiting

You couldnt find a window after six hours  

	Id bet cash 90 of the people couldnt find the window after six
minutes  Ask anybody whos taken basic training in the military  It is
not at all uncommon for a few soldiers who have not properly attached
and cleared their masks to require assistance exiting the chamber  Since
that chamber has a door not just a window its likely a hell of a lot
easier to exit than a multiroom damaged house
