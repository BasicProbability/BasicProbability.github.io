Subject Re Nature of the Waco gas


In article 1r6170INNdlucronkiteCentralSunCOM dbernardclesunCentralSunCOM Dave Bernard writes
 Just heard on the network radio news a spokesman from the army
 saying that the type of CS gas used in Waco had been banned from
 military use  Its use is also banned by a draft international
 agreement on the use of chemical weapons in warfare
 
 The reason given was that the use causes extreme nausea
 blindness disorientation total irrationality raging paranoia  
 Children would be all the more susceptible and show the results
 all the earlier  

Interesting development  Especially since the Feds and the UN
accused Saddam Hussein of using illegal chemicals on his own 
citizens as well  Hmmm  Republican GuardIraqu Army  FBIBATF  
You decide

I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults
and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be
deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last 
seven weeks  

           President William Jefferson Clinton April 20 1993
at a press conferance held the day after the Branch Davidians 
compound went up in flames while under attack by the FBIATF
near Waco Texas  Is your church US Government approved
