Subject Should Anybody be Permitted to Own a 50 BMG rifle
Lines 26

   For the moment forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris  Did
anybody catch Rep Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up
a 50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these  I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck

  So whats your guess for the upcoming antigun agenda

1   A ban on heavy caliber rifles read 50 BMG

2   A ban on sniper rifles

3 A ban on stockpiling guns and ammunition


BTW Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on
     the news I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning

Vote as you shot  19th Cent Republican campaign slogan 


Shumer is not misinformed he knows full well what he is doing

If you look at his other votes and positions as an agent of redistribution
of wealth  property in this country to him guns and personal freedom 
are incompatible with his obvious worldview They are a threat to the
order he would impose

It collectivism vs individualism is an ancient conflict Men have come
close to the truth but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell
after another Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy The
savages whole existence is public ruled by the laws of his tribe
Civilization is the process of setting man free from men

I dont speak for my company We hire the Politically Correct to do that
