     Yeah as information trickles in funny how that works
 
 Funny yeah funny how you didnt wait for the FBI spokesdroid 
 latest reversal of facts before proclaiming the BDs burned
 themselves to death
 
 If you wont believe anything the government says and the press
 is not reliable according to the same logic then what do you base
 your statements on  Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose
 of paranoia

Funny Brent but so far we have heard two versions of the facts

1 What the government says  This includes what the government says that
   two survivors have said

2 What Koreshs lawyer who was actually inside the compound says
   including what he says that most of the survivors have said

Strange but they seem to disagree in most important particulars

If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
speaking firsthand feel free ot pitch in  I may have missed it
But my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
case 2 and not at all like case 1
