If you wont believe anything the government says and the press
is not reliable according to the same logic then what do you base
your statements on  Wild speculation laced with a healthy dose
of paranoia

Are you a moron or just illiterate
 
Oh I forgot youre the guy that doesnt know microwave oven need
electricity never mind

     And youre the guy that doesnt know that illiterate people cant write 
coherent sentences Does that make you superior somehow
