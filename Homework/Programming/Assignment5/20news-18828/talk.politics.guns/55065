 Is there something similar progun people can do   For example pay 100
 to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm   Sounds a bit
 tacky but hey whatever works

How about a gun buybackcharity  Get some sponsors to fund the
purchase of used firearms have a gunsmith check them over and give
or sell them at a low price to poor persons wishing to own firearms 

	Why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately  The NRA
is an educational organization too after all and it would be a shame
to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a
lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes  Mention
that the NRA trains our boys in blue and youve got the media between
a rock and a hard place

	City pays 50 per gun to reduce crime
			or
	NRA to pay 50 per gun to provide training guns for police
	 and citizens  Classes expanded with money saved
