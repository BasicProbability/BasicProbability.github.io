Subject Re CLINTON JOINS LIST OF GENOCIDAL SOCIALIST LEADERS

In article 1r569aINN7sscharnelecstcsuchicoedu nomadecstcsuchicoedu Michael Larish writes

 	How is Clinton responsible  It was a law enforcement action
 Granted it was a nationally covered incident but Clinton had no more to
 do with the outcome than Fred Flintstone

Do I think Clinton conceived of it  No
Do I think Clinton ordered it  No
Do I think Clinton was aware of it before it went down  No
Do I think Clinton was aware of it after it went down  Of course who wasnt
Do I think Clinton prejudged these people to a certain extent because he
                   believed the BATF crap about child abuse and stockpiling
                   evil semiautomatic weapons  Yes
Do I think Clinton ever questioned federal jurisdiction in this matter  No
Do I think Clinton ever considered the civil rights of the victims  No

 	As for the rest I wont argue whether BATF handled the initial
 confrontation well or as it should have  But from day 2 on I have no
 problem with the way the operation was handled or the decisions made

Some of us suspect that ALL the unlawful mistakes made on Day 1 were made 
on the governments end  That makes days 251 nothing but a macho 
alternative to delivering an apology

 As
 for day 51 as long as the FBI and BATF didnt INTENTIONALLY set the fire
 then while it is certainly tragic the majority of Americans according
 to a recent poll have no problems with the operation itself 

Who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit opinion poll of most 
Americans  Most Americans swallow the government line that theyre fed 
not because theyre stupid but because its the only line they ever hear

Most Americans thought the staff at the McMaster school was guilty
guilty guilty  Woops turns out they werent  Most Americans once
thought that black slaves werent human beings  Woops wrong again
Most Americans thought Saddam Hussein was the Antichrist  Oh dear
he was a special friend of the American government until two years 
previously  You know maybe truth ISNT determined by majority vote
of a halfinformed public after all

 In fact
 most Americans according to this poll think it should have been
 resolved sooner

Youre just testy because of all those newsbreaks that were interrupting
