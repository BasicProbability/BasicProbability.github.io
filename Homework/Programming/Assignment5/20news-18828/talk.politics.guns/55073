      The San Francisco Examiner reports that Clinton has issued instructions
to federal law enforcement that they may not kill or injure anyone to 
resolve the Waco situation  So theyve built a fence around the compound
and are now seriously considering building up the fence to prisoncamp
levels pulling out most of the manpower and waiting however many months
it takes

Well either the Examiner was wrong as usual or Clinton lied again

Or perhaps David Koresh didnt listen too well  Just because mistakes
were made does not mean the President lied
