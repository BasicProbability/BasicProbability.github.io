 No Koresh is responsible
 
 If a murderer goes on the rampage it is the murderer who is responsible

rampage n To move about wildly or violently  A course of frenzied
violent action

Who assaulted who here Phill  Do you remember exactly which side came 
out looking for trouble

 The police may bear responsiblity for failing to stop him but the primary
 responsibility is with the murderer

So if it turns out that the fire WAS caused by a tank knocking over a
Coleman lantern youll support punishing the responsible people Phill
Or will you find then find a different reason to hang it all on Koresh
