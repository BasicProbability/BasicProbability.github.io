Subject Re Rewording the Second Amendment ideas

In article C5vB3EEv5sugarneosoftcom kunkeeNeoSoftcom Randy Kunkee writes

 Perhaps we are a little off track  The discussion was about rewording
 the 2nd amendment  This specifically refers to the right to bear arms
 Bear and arms are key words here no  Is it too simplistic to say
 that if you cant pick it up ie bear it or if it is not a firearm
 then it can be restricted without amending the constitution

Firearm  Lets not even consider long knives swords which were also
common militia weapons in the 18th century and which if anything are
often restricted more heavily than firearms  Whatever sense gun control
makes knife control makes even less
