Excerpts from netnewstalkpoliticsguns 21Apr93 The Dayton Gun Buy
Back  by Larry Ciprianicbnewscb 
 Is there something similar progun people can do   For example pay 100
 to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm   Sounds a bit
 tacky but hey whatever works

Progun people can take used potmetal guns with sale values LESS THAN
5000 and turn them in thus making a profit at the gungrabbers
expense
