 napalm then let the wood stove inside ignite it
                       
 As someone else has pointed out why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
 in Texas 

Do YOU eat all your food cold

Ever hear of electric ovens or microwaves  Very popular
Electric stoves outside metroareas especially


Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end  Any generators are
no doubt out of fuel too  So all they would have is wood stoves and
kerosene lanters maybe  It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the
walls knocked over the lanters starting the fire  Remember the FBI
had bugs which they even used illegally to eavesdrop on private
conversations with the lawyers  If a suicide order were given they
WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IN TIME  If the Feds had been concerned they would
have had emergency equipment ready  Not an hour or so later not
leaving the water THEY TURNED OFF off  They could have turned it back
on  They just didnt wanna  Scores to settle
