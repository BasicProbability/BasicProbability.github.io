 Freed om of Religion has absolutely nothing to do with building a small

 I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because
 he grew up inside the cult and engaged in a power struggle where his
 supporters helped inflate his ego
 
 That doesnt change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
 shitload of serious weapons Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
 twisting their impressionable little minds
 
 This was no MOVE fuckup A helicoptor was thermalimaging the compound
 that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously
 There were no CS CANISTERS a specially modified Abrams was pupming the
 stuff in No chance of starting a fire there Kerosene lamps Maybe one
 but not three fires No way Koresh wasnt just talking out of his ass I
 expected this to happen
 
 Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder He had 50 days I think this was
 coming the whole time He didnt even put the children in the buried bus or
 the underground bunker during the CS seige He put them up into the tower
 to die Fuck all of you Big Brother paranoid freaks The only good thing
 to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to
 attract some of the more rootless members of our society

I have not made up my mind about Waco but there sure seems to be a group of  
devoted government following fanatics willing to believe whatever that  
government wants to tell them without any shred of doubt nor thought of thier  
own  They sure get shrill whenever their belief structure is being shaken

Kinda reminds you of the BDs doesnt it
