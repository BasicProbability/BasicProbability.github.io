His last sentence says it all  Who the hell ARE we or the government
to judge their religion as wrong  This event I hope will be recorded
in history as the American Holocaust  These people were murdered 
by the US government just as surely as the jews were by the Nazis
I hang my head in shame for what Ive allowed my government to become

I have NEVER judged them by their religion but by their ACTIONS

If they had lived a quiet religious life as they claimed there would
have been no raid no siege and no deaths  Instead they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID if not
IRRATIONAL  The first was to stockpile weapons  The second was to
shoot federal agents  The third was to stay inside

Last time I checked amassing an arsenal and practicing any kind of
religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights  Guess its
OK with you if we just brush em aside in order to justify killing
a bunch of religious nutcakes eh

Of all the idiots I run into in daily life Dan your type scare me the
most  Youll accept expediency and a cowards safety over any belief
just as long as the government tells you to  You assume that anyone who
doesnt comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and
therefore bad  Worse you seem to accept without question what the
government says is wrong to be wrong

David Koreshs religion was not mine but then again neither are the baptists
methodists catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions  BUT
even though Koreshs the Baptists the methodists etc dont believe
the same way I do I recognize that their religions are equally valid
to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment
You see Im not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others
fit the same catagory  I read the Bible many times and as I learned 
from it I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice
just isnt justified by MY interpretation of the Bible  Therefore I go
my own way  So did Koresh  And neither you nor I nor anyone else
either individually or collectively as the great socialist we has ANY 
RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong

You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to
just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound
in order to save themselves  Think if youre capable for a moment
about some belief you hold dearest  Would you abandon that belief if
suddenly told to do so by the government  If you would do so you are
beneath contempt  Lets assume you have a belief that you hold dear
enough to commit your life to  Do you think it would be the correct
course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically
designed to force you to make that forsake or die decision

The forsake or die option is exactly what the government forced on the
Davidians the day the first wave of blackclad stormtroopers fired that
first shot and tossed that first grenade  The FBI clenched it on Day 51
when they sent in heavy armor against 80someodd men women and
children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms  The
people who stayed who held to their beliefs over personal safety whose
individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit who
believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says to those
people go my deepest respect regardless of their religion  People like
you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with well they could
have come out get my most scornful contempt  Id spit in your face
were there not a network between us  Youre not worth the ashes of
those people who burned
