From article 1r0mhtINNa59cronkiteCentralSunCOM by dbernardclesunCentralSunCOM Dave Bernard
Does that include the right to murder little children  How about killing
ATF officers  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas but 
Koreshs folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket
launchers  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under 
right to bear arms
  
 If the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers why
 werent they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house
 All the media stated was that small arms ie ineffective fire was used
 against them

I noticed that too  Special agent asshole actually Ricks stated that
David Koresh had explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosivesprovided that they had them in the
first place  For example when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas
into the ranch house yes ranch house the BDs werent living in a
fortress they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time  So why didnt
they do this  Could it be that they didnt have any explosives or
similar munitions  I just dont buy what the ATF and FBI have been
saying  Hopefully the truth will come out

Heres something noteworthy  after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurredjust one explosion  The media said that
this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off  I
dont think this was the case  My brother and I noticed that this
socalled explosion resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited
We figure that this is what it was because of how the explosion
looked and sounded  Obviously it wasnt due to something like TNT
dynamite or C4  I have seen a propane explosion beforethe explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this  Also I noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day

Isnt it curious that the ATF wasnt very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed andor wounded by grenades thrown
by the BDs  Earlier when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents they
said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WERENT READY TO RELEASE
THE FINDINGS  Now why is this  Does the ATF have something to hide
Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire  What is the
cause of death exactly  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS

What is certain is this  ATF agents did throw grenades into the
compound  As a matter of fact Mr Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyers visits to the compound  Later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body I dont know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw to the ATF  How much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear  At this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents  Wouldnt it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades rockets
or explosives in the rubble  The ATF would sure have egg on their
face then  Note that the ATF is doing the initial sweep of the
rubble  The FBI and the Texas Rangers wont investigate until the
ATF is done  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to
make sure that others find what they want for them to find if
you know what I mean  Im probably being a little paranoid here
but if I am I have could reason to be  Recall that several weeks
had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades
Also recall that early on the ATF had denied that their agents
used grenades on the BDs  Someone is lying here
