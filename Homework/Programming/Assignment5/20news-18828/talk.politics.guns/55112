Freed om of Religion has absolutely nothing to do with building a small
arsenal and grooming 10year old children to be your wife Ill come out
as soon as I finish my manuscript on the Seven Seals Oh OK David

I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because
he grew up inside the cult and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego

That doesnt change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds

This was no MOVE fuckup A helicoptor was thermalimaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously
There were no CS CANISTERS a specially modified Abrams was pupming the
stuff in No chance of starting a fire there Kerosene lamps Maybe one
but not three fires No way Koresh wasnt just talking out of his ass I
expected this to happen

Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder He had 50 days I think this was
coming the whole time He didnt even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the CS seige He put them up into the tower
to die Fuck all of you Big Brother paranoid freaks The only good thing
to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to
attract some of the more rootless members of our society

  Id have to agree with you there Joe
