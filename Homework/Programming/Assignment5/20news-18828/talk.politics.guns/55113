Subject MA Senate Bills HELP


Two URGENT requests

1 I need the latest update and description of MA bill S897  From
   what I gather this bill takes the Hunter Safety Courses from
   Law Enforcement and places them under Fish  Game control

2 Has someone out there compiled a list of all MA Senate  House
   Bills under consideration  If they have please email me
   the list  If not is there a database I can access
