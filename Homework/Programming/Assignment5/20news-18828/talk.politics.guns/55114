Subject Re TEXAS HB 1776  VOTING IS TODAY

In article 1rgolaINNqjftamsuntamuedu dlb5404tamutstamuedu Daryl Biberdorf writes
I just called Texas legislative bill tracking service and found out
that HB 1776 Concealed Carry is scheduled for a floor vote TODAY
Let those phone calls roll in

Well I dont normally like to quote myself but I just got some
additional information  I called my state rep to express my support
and the person there informed me that its actually just a second
reading of the bill three are required for further consideration
Im not 100 sure what that means and Im also not sure why
theres a discrepancy between what the two offices are telling me

Still researching
