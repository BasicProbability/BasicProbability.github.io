Posting the text of HR 893 
  
8         s1A It shall be unlawful for any person to pos
9   sess an assault weapon unless the weapon was lawfully
page break
1   and continuously possessed by the person since before the 
2   date of the enactment of this subsection

OB illwindandallthat  with Bill the Prez in there at least the
antigunners are out of the closet  The provision that any existing
socalled assault weapons die with their current owners was worked
into HR 3371 102nd Congress bill number a couple of years ago
in a complicated way that the antis claimed was a drafting error

Cant call em lying bastards any longer  Not all the time   

Gridlock the only mechanism ever to succeed in
slowing down the growth rate of Big Government
