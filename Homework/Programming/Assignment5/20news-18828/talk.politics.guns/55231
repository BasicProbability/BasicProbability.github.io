many lines deleted
subject  It is kind of funny though how you were the only one who picked up
the part about my sister being a social worker and keeping me up to date on  e
th
gang thing  Everyone else seemed to just skim by that part

Actually those of us who have experience with social workers pointedly
ignored it

Ah here Freeman is being prejudiced look it up and see what I mean Freeman
Here Freeman is prejudging someone before he knows all of the facts  Guess
it can happen to the best and in his case the worst of us


Quit while youre behind
andy

Freeman thinks I am behind when actually I am quite on top of things  The
point he seems to be missing now is that after a certain point accuracy can be
very tedious and ridiculous  See Freemans next post for an explanation
