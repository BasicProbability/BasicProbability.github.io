MGBSLACVMSLACSTANFORDEDU says
From AP   According to numerous accounts by those in the compound
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane
tank and turning over numerous gas lanterns

Oh Then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places
In particular three different places where there were no APVs

And just where is the evidence for this FBI sayso The Texas Medical
Examiner refuted 2 of their lies today


And if the government did start the fire then why werent people trying
to get out of the compound

Let me put you in a building pump in CS knock the walls down around
you and see how fast you find an exit

And besides oh I dont know why Im even bothering

I dont know why either youre willing to swallow everything fed you
Good boy

I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept
the governments story despite much evidence to the contrary

I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
a murderous heavilyarmed religious cult despite much evidence to the
contrary Thought Experiment Suppose this exact same thing happened under
the Bush administration What would your answer be then Would you still
prefer to believe the cultists

Oh a Clinton apologist why didnt you say so

No I dont really expect a response to that challenge

But then
again that is how Mr Clinton was elected by people who believe that
his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office

Um isnt that how all politicians are elected

If people will believe that of any politican it is little wonder they
will believe all of the factoids being given out as fact by the
ClintonRenoFBIBATF confederation

So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
people Are they like just plain evil or what Did they just wake up
one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the United States
to figure out who to oppress that day Im eager to know

The kgBATF was expecting a quick victory while the cameras rolled
however they were the only ones with a script

And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader How is he
on diabolical laughter Does he look good in a cape These things MUST be
investigated You first

Hey youre the apologist you tell us

   so I propose that we destroy the moon neatly solving that problem
Your blood pressure just went up        Mark Sachs IS mbs110psuvmpsuedu
