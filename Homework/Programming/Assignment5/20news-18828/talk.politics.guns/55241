Any death is serious  Wanna discuss match control  Firearms related
unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or
more negligent persons not the gun

No I dont want to discuss match control  I dont equate a book of matches
to a loaded 9 millimeter either

And you shouldnt as the matches kill more kids  So why are you bleating
about guns

say that tired old NRA line Guns dont kill people people kill people

It may be tired but it is true

Sure people can kill people without guns  But easy access to guns makes it
a lot more convenient  Guns dont kill people People with easy access to
guns kill people

No thats not right either  People who have both easy access and the
desire to kill kill people  Considering that people who have the
desire to kill turn that into easy access   Havent you folks
learned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs

If you dont affect the desire youre wasting your time not to
mention the other costs incurred

    Jim Im just saying how it is  Im not saying if that is a good thing
or not From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun
buyback programs I get the impression that they really think they are
having an impact on the community

Good for them  I note that the TM folks make the same argument  If
youll pay their expesnses 21 million for a reasonable size city
they promise to meditate away all crime disease etc  At least
theyre not promising to jail me if I dont go along with their little
plan  theyre going to just sit in a room and fly leaving me alone

gun violence whether its effective or not  Look if you cant measure
the impact of these programs using some sort of pretest and posttest
evaluation what is the point  It must be symbolic in nature

Ah but we have evaluated gun control using beforeafter and it
doesnt work to reduce crime  What is the point  We cant claim that
it is symbolic as people do get jailed

The police are
essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you dont
want it well give you 50 for itbecause we care about the community

No theyre essentially saying we hope this will keep you from
noticing that were not doing anything useful  Pissing away
resources isnt caring

If you I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous

Nope youll merely be ignored as Wright Rossi and Daly were after
finishing Under the Gun  They were supposed to prove that gun
control worked so 

 Jim listen to me I said IM NOT RELIGIOUS WHATSOEVER do you understand

  Religion has nothing to do with this  I could care less what religion
they were okay  To put children in that situation is wrong pure and
simple  Difference is good Jim I am the most progressive and diverse
person in the world  But if different is allowing kids to be exposed
to tanks and teargas then yes Jim DIFFERENT IS WRONG

So who gassed them  Given their previous experience with thugs who
threw grenades before yelling were from the govt and were here to
help you would a rational person think that the feds had their best
interests at heart  Would you know that the gas was nonlethal
