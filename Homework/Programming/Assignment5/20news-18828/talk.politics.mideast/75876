Subject Re No humanity in Bosnia

It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my postingI recieved a couple of letters toosome has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern worldThose who contest this statement present the figures of the World War IIHowever we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop ittoday is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILLIt
seems to be that what we lack is the will
Second point of difference which makes it different from the holocastsp  is that at that time international community
didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event
today inspite of all the mightthe international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which
is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bullyHence indirecltly and possibly
unintentionally mankind has sided with the killersAnd thisI think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world
