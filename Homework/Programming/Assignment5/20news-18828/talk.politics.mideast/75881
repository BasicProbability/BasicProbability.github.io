On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven oclock show
at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee about 50 yards 
away The SK theater They were showing an Argentinian film The Abyss 
Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at 
the City Party Committee but they were silent theres no conversation 
whatsoever and we couldnt figure out what was going on That is we knew it 
was about Karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if 
someone gave a speech or not we didnt know We bought our tickets There 
were 30 or 40 people in the theater This was a very small number for that 
large movie theater The film started About 30 minutes later they stopped the
film A crowd burst in About 60 people They came up onto the stage Well 
mostly they were young people from 16 to 23 years old They demanded that an 
Armenian woman come up onto the stage They used foul language and said that 
they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do 
to Armenian girls I thought thats what they meant because they had demanded 
a girl specifically Marina and I were sitting together I told her to move 
over there were some Russian girls sitting nearby So that if someone 
recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not Marina 
It got quiet 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out but the door was closedits
only opened at the end of the   showand they returned to their seats 
Everyone in the theater was looking at one another Russians Azerbaijanis 
people of various nationalities But no one reacted at all no one in the 
auditorium made a sound They were silent looking at one another and 
gradually started to leave Some guy a really fat one says OK weve 
scared them enough lets leave They leave slowly pompously It seemed to 
me that those people were not themselves Either they had smoked a bunch of 
anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like 
they were ready to tear anyone apart Then it was all over as though nothing 
had happened at all The film started up again it was one of those cheerful 
films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive We 
could barely sit to the end So it had started at seven it was over by nine 
and it was dark   

Marina and I were walking home Lenin Street thats the center of town Lenin
Street was packed just packed with young people They were shouting 
something about Karabagh and something about Armenians We werent especially 
listening because the way we were feeling we didnt know if we were going to 
make it home or not and just what had happened anyway Public transportation 
wasnt running Incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police 
policemen standing there The director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors 
there are basically all glass Everything was broken He stood there grief
stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some 
naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot Well 
since he looked more or less calm I decided that nothing all that super 
serious had happened We went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we 
live literally one stop away We didnt want to go on foot not because it was
dark but because something might happen We flagged down a cab but the 
driver didnt want to take us We told him we live near the bus station and 
he said hed take us to the bus station and not a yard farther I said well 
OK   

So we got into the cab and managed to get there Something incredible was 
happening at the bus station There was a traffic jam Public transportation 
was at a standstill and everyone was shouting Karabagh theyre not going 
to give up Karabagh I go home and tell my family whats going on and theres
immediate panic in the house Mamma says what should we do Like the end had 
come they were going to come kill us thats it    Somehow we managed to 
cheer ourselves up Nothing that bad could happen Where are we living anyway
just what kind of social order do we have Somehow we manage to calm Mamma 
down And we went to bed But no one could sleep Everyone made as though 
nothing had happened

That was on Saturday In short the day went by We didnt go anywhere and 
didnt call our relatives No one did anything Because    life goes on
That day I realized something was approaching but what exactly I couldnt
guess

On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always
had There were five of us at home Mamma Papa and us three sisters Lyuda 
Marina and I My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time We sat at home and 
no one went out Later we learned that a demonstration had started that 
morning It all started    They were smashing up stores We were sitting at
home and didnt know anything about it Then a girlfriend of mine Lyuda 
Zimogliad came by at around three oclock I think We worked together we did
our apprenticeships together shes a Russian girl She said that something
awful was happening in town I asked Dont they want Armenians Well what 
are they after if theyre already in that state She says no nothing like 
that its just a demonstration but its awful to watch it Somehow it feels
like a war has broken out Public transportation has been stopped    The 
cabs the buses well its just a nightmare

Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy 
problems at the time    He left the house and our neighbor Aunt Vera
asked him Where are you going Stop There are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard arent you afraid to go out Papa didnt know what she
was talking about She simply pushed him back into the entryway He came home 
and told Mamma Mamma said Well if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on But we didnt go see her shes a Russian
she lives across from us I had to see my friend out Around five oclock I 
tell Lyuda Ok look its time for you to go its late already Ill see 
you out Mamma says You dont need to go its too late already you can 
see what the situation in town is So we decided to stay home Dinner was 
ready Mamma says Let her eat with us then she can go We sat down at the 
table But no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything 
out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that were eating
We turned on the television and the show In FairyTale Land was coming on 
We cleared the table

We hear some noise out in the courtyard I go out on the balcony but I cant 
see whats going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station and there is a 9story building in the way There is mob of people 
   I cant figure out whats happening Theyre shouting something looking
somewhere I cant make out what is going on I go down to a neighbor shes 
an Azerbaijani weve been friends of her family for about 25 years I go down
to look from their place I see people shouting looking at the 5and 9story 
buildings near the bus station Just then soldiers set upon them about 20 
people with clubs The mob runs off in different directions I even see 
several people from our building They are looking and laughing    I decide
that means its not all that bad if they are laughing it means theyre not 
killing anyone But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers One of 
the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their 
feet everyones kicking him    I become ill and go home and explain in 
general terms that horrible things are going on out there     cant speak
   Well theyve probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is   
If each of them kicked him just once    They took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it But it was far away and I couldnt see if he
got up and left or not

I become terrified and go home and say Lyuda dont go anywhere stay at our
place because if you go out they could kill you or     Then the crowd 
runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12story building and 
starts shouting something We go out onto the balcony All of our neighbors 
are also out on theirs too Everyone is standing staring The mob is 
shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building As it 
turns out at the 12story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and 
kept them from coming in Theres only one entryway there they could stop 
them

They all run up to our building Mamma immediately starts closing the windows
afraid that they might throw stones They have stones and they break the 
windows all of them There are very many people We have a large courtyard 
and its packed with people They spill up to the first floor so they dont 
crush each other They crawl up on trees posts and garages Its just a huge
cloud of people They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey 
Sargisian from our building We close the windows and immediately hear 
tramping in our entryway They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous 
din and roar Its incomprehensible Mamma told me later that they were 
shouting Fathers name Grisha open the door weve come to kill you or
something like that I dont remember that I was spaced out kind of Mamma 
says Into the bedroom quickly In the bedroom we have two tall beds part 
of our dowry Mamma says Hide there they probably wont come in there 
theyll ask something say something and leave She says Well tell them 
that we live alone here I cant imagine that my parents will stand out in 
the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts    I go to them and say 
that Ill stand together with them Ill talk with them if they come maybe I 
can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me I speak 
Azerbaijani more or less and I can find out what they want I told Marina and
Lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister Lyuda I cant remember if I told 
her anything or not

Then    they open the door its like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall The crows bursts in and starts to shout Get out of here
leave vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia things like that I
tell them What has happened speak calmly One of you tell me calmly what
has happened In Azerbaijani they say Get out of the apartment leave I 
say OK Go downstairs Well gather everything we need and leave the 
apartment I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them these are animals They must be stopped The ones standing in the
doorway the young guys say There are old people and one girl with them
Too bad They take two or three steps back It seems as though I have
pacified them with our exchange Then someone in the courtyard shouts 
commanding them Dont you understand what you are saying Kill them

And that was it That was all it took They grab Papa carry him into one
room and Mamma and me into another They put Mamma on the bed and start 
undressing her beating her legs They start tearing my clothes right there 
in front of Mamma I dont remember where they went what they did or how 
much time passed I had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body
and tore my clothes all at the same time I dont even know what I said The 
atrocities started I was savagely raped in that room They argued among 
themselves who would go first

Later I remember I came to I dont know if Im dead or alive Someone comes
in someone tall I think cleanshaven in an Eskimo dogskin coat balding 
He looks around at whats happening At that instant everything stops It 
seems to me that he is either their commander or    that somehow everything
depends on him He looks and says Well were done here They are beating
Mamma on the head They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs 
   She loses consciousness and they decide that shes dead Papa    was
out cold They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony but they cant get the 
window open Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the 
windows cant be opened They leave her next to the window She was thinking 
about being thrown out the window and passed out Shes not a real strong 
person anyway    He looks at me and sees that Im saying something that
Im still twitching Well I start saying the opposite of what I should be 
which is humbling myself and pleading I start shouting cursing    they 
dont get any entreaty out of me I  already know that Im dead why would I 
humble myself before anyone And he says that if thats what I think since my
tongue is so long    maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing 
   In short he commands that I be taken outside

I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda I dont 
know if they are alive or not They take me outside They are dragging me by 
my arms by my legs They are hitting me against the wall the railings 
something metal    While they are carrying me someone is biting me someone
else is pinching me   I dont even know I think my God when will death 
come If only it were sooner    Then    they carry me out throw me near
the entryway    and start kicking me I lose consciousness    What 
happened after that how many people there were I dont remember
 
I come to after a while I dont remember how long A neighbor is bringing me 
clothing Im entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me I remember 
that I said the same words over and over again Mamma what happened Mamma 
what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at I cant make 
sense out of anything There is a guy standing over me I sort of know him he
served in Afghanistan his name is Igor he brought me indoors When they all 
went to the third entryway and killed a person there Igor gathered his 
courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though 
hes smallminded he put himself at risk Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani he 
served in Afghanistan There are three brothers The older brother also served
there I think now hes stationed here on the border in Armenia Igor 
brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying 
Karina I know you calm down Im not one of them How do I know whos who 
and whats what I come to and they clean me up I was covered in blood Then
Papa    I saw Papa I saw Mamma And Marina too    Igor was there when 
they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed    Marina    Lyuda 
said that she was Russian they said well let you go we arent touching the
Russians go And while they are dragging Marina out she decides shes going 
to tell them shes Azerbaijani Igor immediately grabs Marinas and Lyudas 
hands because he knows Marina and knows that she is Armenian and is our 
sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbors and starts pounding 
on the door so she will open up She opens the door and Igor pushes them in 
there So they survived

My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things
While they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back 
up again Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed 
there Then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put 
it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbors on the fourth floor the
one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and 
knocked on the door The neighbor opened and said Im not going to let you 
in the apartment because Im afraid of them But Ill give you some stockings 
and well leave the building Lyuda says Ill stay at your place because of
whats going on they keep going up and down the stairs It was just for a 
moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldnt consent Lyuda came 
back to our place and lay under the bed   

I came to Mother was there I cant remember my supervisors telephone 
number but something had to be done Somehow I remembered and called and he 
came to get us He didnt have any idea what was going on He thought we were 
simply afraid he didnt know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death He came and got us and took us to the police precinct
There they looked us over I was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly 
it was hard to breathe   

My supervisors name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov Hes the head of our 
administration They took us there When we were leaving I saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town The buses were ordinary 
passenger buses There were very many soldiers We left around eleven right 
after eleven If these people could stop what was happening they could save a 
great many lives    Because the crowd was moving on toward the school and
what was going on there    I think everyone know not only in Sumgait not 
only in Yerevan Because there they murdered them all one after the next 
without stopping After us

I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No 3 and 10 to 12 of them were from
Buildings 4 5 and 6 In our building one person died and one old woman died
from Building 16 thats the building in front of ours There young 
Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldnt let it into their building 
Incidentally when we were at the neighbors Marina called our relatives
to warn them so they would all know what was happening I called a aunt in 
Microdistrict No 5 They have three neighbors who are Armenians I said Run
quickly I cant explain whats going on hide do what you can just stay
alive Hide at Azerbaijanis ones who wont give you away At that moment 
three people came in policemen I think they were Azerbaijanis I was in such
awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up 
there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought I would ever see anything 
out of that eye again    my forehead was badly cut and onehalf of my face
was pushed out forward No one would have thought that I would survive get my
normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all I started to 
scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you 
here havent you killed people people yet what are you doing here One of 
the soldiers said Dont scream at us Were Muslims but were not from the 
Sumgait police They called in from Daghestan So at that point the 
Daghestan police were there

When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there
there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen    I dont know
maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously 
injured to treat them there in the police precinct I dont know what they 
were there for There were also doctors from Baku there They examined Lyuda 
and me and said These women need to go to the Maternity Home but we dont 
know what to do with the rest

So they took us and I lost contact with my parents my boss everyone My 
boss said Dont worry Ill find you no matter where you are no matter
what happens We went to the hospital There we were examined by a department
head from the Sumgait Maternity Home Pashayeva I think her name was She 
examined us The ambulance was from Baku I figured out that the Sumgait 
ambulances hadnt done anything they didnt respond to any calls People 
called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life

That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened for she became quite glad I even thought to myself 
God can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong She looks me over and 
says Now why are you suffering so You dont know what your people have been
doing your people did even worse things And I think great I have to deal 
with her    And I felt so bad I thought why dont I just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her Here I am in this 
condition and being told about something that our people did I just didnt 
have the energy to say How could our people possibly be smart enough to 
think of something that yours havent already done I stayed there Then they
brought in another woman Ira B she was married and she was raped in her 
own apartment too There were three of us Ira Lyuda and 1 The next 
morning they took Lyuda and Ira away They didnt do anything to help us This
was in the old Maternity Home in the combined block They didnt do anything 
more than examine me that was it I didnt want any shots or tranquilizer 
nothing What shots could have calmed me down I didnt even want to look at 
them

I lay in the ward Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur
pose but I was alone I was alone even though the wards were packed That
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face
was disfigured She asked what had happened to me and I said Better to ask 
your brother what happened theres no point in asking me your brother can 
better explain what happened She fell into a faint All the doctors threw 
themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward

Then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me 
clothing because I was literally naked The only thing I had on was a dress 
but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up 
above my knees and the woman orderly said I cant believe you put on such a
short dress who are you showing off your legs to here I went back to my 
ward thinking just one more thing from something People from work came and 
brought me something in a sack apples I think three or four pounds but I 
couldnt take them I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing I said
that I couldnt take the apples and really didnt have any appetite No one 
had to bring me anything Some woman took the sack    And oh yes    
Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should 
be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an 
Armenian maybe they wouldnt figure it out from looking at me So they must 
have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something 
else would happen That it would be worse Or perhaps someone was outside on
the street I dont know In any case I didnt sleep a wink that night

The next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus 
and off we went I didnt even know where they were taking me They took me to
the club where the troops were the very one I was in that illfated evening
I got off the bus Near the City Party Committee there were a great many 
troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible I saw 
a few people I knew there and that calmed me a little I had already thought 
that I was the only one left So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait 
after that night I still didnt know what happened to my parents they didnt 
come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine 
I didnt know whether to believe him or not Maybe he was just trying to calm 
me down maybe something happened on the way Then I went to the club and saw 
a lot of people I knew They all knew one another they were all kissing each 
other and asking What happened what went on Two days later they came to 
see me from work They were there all the time Each day they came showed 
interest and were constantly bringing me money They did everything they 
could Of course Im most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues 
who didnt lose his presence of mind and who didnt change his opinions 
neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what 
happened He constantly took an interest A sincere interest from the heart 
   Then about two days later the secretary of the Party Committee came 
not from our Party organization but from the First Trust which ours is part 
of Comrade Kerimov a very important figure in our town He made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if I sat down by
myself I couldnt get up or lie down again There was something wrong with my
lungs it was hard to breathe They examined me there several times there I 
lay were several doctors they all thought that    that it must just be 
from all the blows I dont know They didnt diagnose anything in particular
When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked    I made it a point of 
insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful 
There was no way something inside wasnt broken my ribs    Well they took 
me there and took xrays and said that everything was fine There were 
emergency medical workers on duty in the club The mother of one of Marinas 
friends was there She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Childrens Clinic 
They had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what I
needed at that moment I thought I said that I was having great difficulty
breathing I couldnt seem to get enough air something was wrong with me
They put tight bandages around my chest and waist Later I overheard some
people saying that I had been cut all over I think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut    But I
wasnt cut

They took us to the Khimik boarding house We lived there a long time Soon 
appeared representatives    They were agitating At first people would not 
talk to them and drove them off One of the Armenian women shouted We 
demand that Seidov come The response was Its Seidov who sent us Seidov 
is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers The woman said 
Well only see Seidovs daughter have her come here well do the same 
things to her that they did to our daughters and then well deal with you 
agitators And so on More of them said Have Seidov himself come This 
went on day in day out The agitators kept coming and coming this drove us 
out of our wits Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because 
they realized it was senseless to stay Everything got on our nerves The 
smell the small children There were children at the SK club children who 
had literally just come out of the Maternity Home What were they doing in a 
club that didnt even have running water all the time At first we had to pay 
to eat there They even overcharged us as it turned out On the second day 
someone told us that they would bring us food for free The children were ill
Everything stank there Well imagine about 3000 people in a small movie 
theater with seating for no more than 500 You couldnt sit or lie down it 
was impossible to even move The stench was awful Even the smallest infants 
took ill overnight there I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in 
Yerevan the infants They have to be washed they have to be bathed not to 
mention that we the adults were ill and needed care People were fainting 
right and left I just dont know everyone was crying everyone    Only 
the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together But the women 
were in a constant state of panic It seemed to everyone that they would come 
any minute and kill and stab It seemed clear that we had been gathered 
together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie 
theater and there wouldnt be a single Armenian left Then people went up to 
the attic I didnt see them I only heard them because I was lying down and 
couldnt get up I lay right on the stage we had some room there Apparently 
they caught two people with either oil or gas I think they wanted to burn the
theater Maybe someone saw them I didnt I was in no condition to open my 
eyes

Everyone was suspicious of everyone else They would ask Arent you an 
Azerbaijani I think I saw you somewhere I think youre an Azerbaijani They
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports relatives might be covering for each other Half of the people did
not have any documents There were people who had run out of their homes in 
nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like
they should have with their IDs

So on the 28th on Sunday I think the police did nothing to help us On
Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A They didnt 
spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody They killed
they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible They murdered 
the Melkumian family whom I knew my mother worked with them Their daughter
inlaw went to school with my older sister They were brutally murdered Only 
the two daughtersinlaw survived By a miracle one was able to save herself 
she ran away the neighbors wouldnt take her in so she ran about the 
building until she found refuge She was pregnant and had two small children 
This all continued on Monday in Block 41A on the 29th when the troops were 
already in the city

They murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire 
families They say they didnt even know for sure if the people were Armenians
or not I heard that the Lezgins suffered too Im not sure myself I didnt 
see any Lezgins who had been injured They burned cars so its very difficult 
now to say exactly who died and who didnt It was very difficult to identify 
the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned    its all very hard to imagine of course I heard 
that many people disappeared without a trace from the BTZ plant two people 
including a woman who worked the night shift Aunt Razmella who also lived in
Microdistrict 3

They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait In the evening people who 
had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait and people from Baku were 
going home from Sumgait and there were students too They were simply 
savagely murdered They were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did 
what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that 
hoard of brutally minded people They stopped the buses dragged the Armenians
out and killed them on the spot I didnt see it myself but I heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them Later it was hard to discern from 
the corpses well you cant call them corpses you had to figure out from the 
ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student Ira
G if Im not mistaken She was in the hospital a long time after that and 
she still cant figure out who saved her She was also brutally raped and 
beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses The fellow pulled her out of that 
whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and 
carried her to the city I still cant imagine how he managed to do that

I heard that from Engels Grigorian He knows her apparently Well a lot of 
people went to that hospital anyway She was in the hospital and singing a 
song in Armenian and they wrote the words down and I think he still has 
that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song 
the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape They 
couldnt find the guy who saved her He left her in someones apartment and
called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me
she couldnt remember anyones face

I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe I had 
talked with him once But I received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head I cant remember to this day who he was Then it seems I saw
the Secretary of the Directorates Party organization where Marina works She
goes to school and works she goes to night school at AZI and works by day at
the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration Im the 
Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met 
with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations We had joint 
meetings I know them all Ive even talked with them and he I know is from
Armenia An Azerbaijani but from Armenia It became obvious that many of 
those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia

They took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the
Procuracy because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case and I iden
tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize They
showed me the people who were in our apartment theyre working on our
case but I cant even recognize them although it was proved that they were
the ones theyre processing it somehow They tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were 
dragging me There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch 
me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that All these 
people all of them as much as Ive heard about them and seen them they were
all from Kafan

The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf Najaf Rzayev He was 
there when everything started It must have been him because I didnt 
recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him All the more since
I told him Listen you do something because you know me He turned away 
and went toward the bedroom where Marina was Well you couldnt see Marina 
anyway There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldnt make out 
anyone All of it flew right out of my head and then gradually I became 
myself again at the City Party Committee    There were military people 
there I told them what went on and they wrote it all down I told them his 
name On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization the one 
were part of came to see us his name is Najaf Rzayev I tell Mamma If
hes here despite the fact that I gave his name it means that either his 
alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think Im crazy not 
responsible for my words He said What did they do to you how awful 
myself I hid an Armenian family Then after some time goes by he comes back 
again and says something entirely different I wasnt at home my family and 
I went to Baku I said Marina what is he saying He said something totally
different before After that I didnt go to see our Procurator our case is 
being handled by a procurator from Voronezh Fedorov by name Fedorov told me 
that Rzayevs case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved 
What are they doing with Rzayev
Did he prove his alibi or not They just think that since I was hit in the 
head I cant say anything for sure whether it was him or not It will be an 
insult if he was in our apartment and doesnt have to pay for it but at the 
same time

Im afraid to say Im a hundred percent sure that it was he Because no mat
ter who I name they tell me no youre wrong he didnt do that that one
wasnt there All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind Who did what
exactly I cant say                                                     

When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but I didnt see it 
because I had my eyes closed all the time It seemed to me that I always got
it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it 
always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible When they were beating my 
face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out So I had my eyes closed 
they took me outside and started to beat me A young guy 22 held my arms he
works at the BTZ plant And right nearby across the road from us Block 41 
is where all this was going on Right across the road from us The BTZ 
dormitory is over there thats where he lives Now hes in custody they even
have proved as far as I know that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building One person in our 
building was killed it was that man

A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me He saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didnt come 
over he just looked and then went into the dormitory A while after it was 
all over people started making announcements in town saying that 
investigators had been summoned That guy went and told them everything Now 
theyve caught him everythings been proved Now evidently theyve been
beating him I dont know what theyre doing with them over there but he 
himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant Some young guy 
came to the plant and said Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the 
bus station on Saturday at ten That was it He said the ones who wanted to
went This was at the BTZ plant during the night shift probably late Friday
night It was at night they were at the sauna together And he said what do 
you mean do you understand what you are saying The others were silent 
probably in their hearts they were thinking Im going to go But they didnt
say anything to one another He said that he thought it important to to go 
because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan that they had 
killed their Azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of 
that That guy was also born in Kafan That is certain And Marina says that 
the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia too                                                             from

Ive participated in the investigation a couple of times Im satisfied with
them thus far They summoned us and asked about what happened and every word 
I said was recorded I met some guy there    By the way he was an 
Armenian I said that he was in our apartment but what he did I dont know 
His last name was Grigorian Eduard Grigorian He s from Sumgait from 
Microdistrict 1 He was sentenced I think to five years not his first time 
His mother is Russian I met with him at the KGB in Baku at the Azerbaijani 
KGB They took us there and showed me photographs There were so many 
photographs I think they even photographed those people who were caught at 
curfew and Ive got them all confused I say the face was about like this 
the guy in the white coat with the red clasps But he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a 
haystack Well This guy Grigorian I said he was in our apartment but he 
is so lightcomplected that he looks like a Lezgin I dont know what he did 
I cant remember Maybe he beat me or raped me But he was in our apartment 
At the KGB he started asking me pleading with me theres no need for this 
all this stuff look me in the eyes youre like a sister to me I took a look
at him and thought My God Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like 
you But they were satisfied with my responses because I said everything 
without great certainty I was there with Mamma Then Lyuda came in but when 
she came in she got sick immediately She wanted to kill him she crawled over
the table at him She recognized him When she came to Lyuda was lying on the
balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom We had 
all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters 
They stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things At that 
moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything Well seeing the 
faces hearing the voices    Two people were saying they could burn the 
apartment Another says why burn the apartment when Ive got three kids and 
no place to live So this guy was in temporary housing he didnt have 
anywhere to live he was from Sumgait They were sure that they would get the 
apartment Besides the neighbors were Azerbaijani Why should they burn the 
apartment they might burn Azerbaijanis Thats what they said How did they 
know there were Azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that
Armenians lived there We have a list of the residents for our part of the 
building our name is in there but how could they know that Azerbaijanis 
lived on the other side of the wall from us So they didnt set fire to our 
apartment

I dont know I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt 
when I was outside if someone had asked me what was happening I would
have said that a civil war was going on Well maybe not civil    but
probably civil because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at
a free horror film So a civil war was going on and only the Armenians were
being fought If it were a world war or something like that they would have
been fighting everyone But they only fought us Then I met some women from 
our building some Azerbaijanis They are crying they tell me Karina we 
saw all of it how could it happen Theyre asking me Well I just dont know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to 
me I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldnt have been 
able to take it or I would have tried to avert it like that one Azerbaijani 
woman did in front of our building A woman lives there an awful dissipated 
woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads Two 
Armenian families live there in her part of the building She came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse She 
came down to the entryway and said Youll come in this entryway over my dead
body So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway Some 
folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didnt 
even know what they were doing I dont think thats true They knew very well
what they were doing if they didnt even lift a hand against that woman They 
couldnt have cared less about her but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani 
stopped them

They were just beasts they had smoked so much When they came to our place 
they were all chewing something I noticed Everyone who came into the 
apartment was chewing something I think my God maybe I just think that 
Maybe Im losing my mind But no theyre all chewing something Maybe it is 
some kind of drug it must be because    At first glance they all seemed 
to be such normal people young cleanshaven looking exactly as if they had 
come to some sort of celebration But they were shouting something They
didnt talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there They 
screamed and screamed Yeah killing killing were killing the Armenians 
Only they didnt shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary Gurun 
literally means kill or destroy

Thats how it was Ill continue We hid in a captains apartment hes an
Azerbaijani his wife is a Tatar We were sitting in their apartment their 
kids were out in the yard Their kids knew a whole lot This was in our part 
of the building on the third floor When Mamma came to and couldnt find
Lyuda she took Papas hand this was while the looters were stealing things
but they didnt pay attention because they were stealing things Apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing Mamma found the
courage to   

A boy said to my mother Wheres the gold Mamma said he must have been 12 
to 14 years old He even looked Russian he was so fairskinned But the 
Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fairskinned I noticed they were all on the 
fair side He shouted they were all smashing things and he asks Mamma where 
the gold is We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers In a 
little black bag we kept everything in there Mamma doesnt really like to 
wear gold She probably never even wore those things from the time they were 
bought for her They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass Mamma
thinks that the gold saved us Because they threw themselves at the gold and 
Mamma grabbed Papa who was trying to breathe They had closed his mouth 
bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face    They had 
shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate Mamma grabbed him and 
tore all that stuff off    He had something in his mouth he was having 
trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood Mamma grabbed him and 
started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted 
to open their doors to them Mamma said that by accident completely by 
accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said halfawake 
Whats happened He sees that they are bloody Mamma said At least go and 
find out whats happening to my daughters even if theyve burned them or 
murdered them at least bring the corpses He went looking for us At that 
moment Lyuda was under the bed She says that after they left it seemed that 
someone was calling her name When he quietly called her she couldnt get out 
from under the bed She wanted to get out and was calling softly She thought 
she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to 
herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting When she got out from 
under the bed everyone was gone And again    She thought that she had lost
her mind Ill never leave here never To hell with it It just seems that 
way to me Ill come to eventually But then when everything had settled 
down stopped that mall brought Lyuda down and Igor carried me in from
outside Or first I was brought in then Lyuda I dont remember what order it
happened in

And Mamma said Listen theyre all running around down there shouting 
something or other and running toward the other building It had more or 
less calmed down where we were Whos dead whos alive we dont know I 
tried to call my girlfriend I had basically come to Mamma says Listen
lets go upstairs at least get a mattress or something We dont know how 
long well be here Maybe they didnt burn everything I dont get it all
women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe 
not everything was taken I tell Mamma Mamma what do you need any of that 
for To hell with it Were alive forget the rest of it all of it She
says No lets go get at least something Maybe well leave here spend the 
night at someone elses Mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son
Alik was standing on the lookout lIe was standing there to see if they were 
coming They only managed to run up there and grab something one time He 
shouts Come back theyre coming They didnt have enough time to get a 
lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another    Mamma got my 
knitting    Someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore
out of the hall    Someone took Fathers old coveralls The neighbor his 
wife Mamma and Papa    Marina went with them I was in no condition to 
leave Neither was Lyuda We just sat They ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs 
theyre dragging something again They were going toward the other building 
maybe over by the school or    There was an unfinished building over
there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished 
building they could gradually carry everything over there Then things more 
or less calmed down I tried to call my boss

Later there was more noise We were on the third floor in a onebedroom
apartment and a woman lives in the onebedroom place on the second floor
Asya Dallakian Shes an old woman retired She wasnt at home at that
time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and
her grandson is in the army She is only very rarely in town she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant They started
pounding on her door and broke it down She had two or three beds in there 
something like that shes a 60to 70yearold woman who really does not even 
live there Probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and 
mattresses and a television When her grandson came she bought a television 
They started wrecking everything I started getting sick again I think My 
God what is going on around here When will this end We turned off the 
lights and sat As it turns out the people who werent afraid the ones who 
knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights We didnt know but 
they didnt come to where we were all the same They all knew very well that 
he was a captain He went out and closed the door and we sat in his 
apartment His last name was Kasumov Hes an exserviceman retired works up 
at the fire station at some plant or other He went out and stood at his door
They tell him Comrade Captain dont worry we wont harm you youre one of
us He went upstairs and they say Arent you taking anything from this 
apartment He says I dont need anything And the women who were standing 
in the yard    we have a basement full of water    the women who were 
standing in the yard saw Those guys they left everything they stole on the 
first floor and ran upstairs again The women threw everything they had time 
to into the basement to save our property Some things were left dirty 
pillows two or three other things and a rug A guy came downstairs really 
mad and he says Wheres the rug I just put it right here They tell him 
Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school He ran off in that
direction

Oh I forgot the most important point When Igor picked me up in his arms 
there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on They 
just didnt tell me about it for a long time The wife of that military man 
she didnt want to kill my spirit I was already dead enough Later she told 
me that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them 
the ringleader apparently a young man said Wheres the girl who was here
And he became furious The woman tells him She came to     She didnt
know what to say Think something up Someone carried her off Then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family So the woman says She
came to and went to the basement Now our basement is full of water So the 
whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse They took 
flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been 
standing there for years and soot and fuel oil They climbed down in there 
to get me Then one of them said Theres so much water down there she 
probably walked and walked and then passed out and died She met her death in 
the basement Thats it we can leave no problem I didnt know that and 
when I was told I felt worse Two times worse A lot worse So they didnt 
just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me   

After that we of course didnt want to live in Sumgait any longer We really 
didnt want to go back to our apartment When we moved I went up there and 
started to quiver and shake all over because I started remembering it all 
Although the neighbors all sobbed it was all    so cheap    The people 
who sat in their apartments and didnt help us at a time like that I think 
that they could have helped I dont think that they were obligated to but 
they could have helped us Because that one woman was able to stop that whole 
brutal crowd by herself That means they could have too It would have been
enough foe one man or women to say What do you think youre doing Thats 
all That would have done it There were 60 apartments in our building Not 
one person said it When I was lying on the ground and all those people were 
standing on their balconies I didnt hear anyones voice no one said what are
you doing leave her alone    Mamma even told one of the neighbor women 
that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian They would have stood up for 
one of their own True they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway 
an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom The Azerbaijanis have a custom 
if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed 
to stop immediately The old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they
stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said If
you want to go on living youll disappear into your apartment So she left
That trick didnt work on them

Even the neighbors who helped us move told me OK fine calm down forget 
that it happened I said Id only forget it if I told them right then that it
had happened to their daughterand if that didnt have any effect on them 
then I would forget everything too Imagine that it happened to your sister 
And no one did anything Anything
