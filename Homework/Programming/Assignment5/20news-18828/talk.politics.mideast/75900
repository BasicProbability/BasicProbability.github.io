 I believe this is your most succinct post to date Since you have nothing
 to say you say nothing Its brilliant Did you think of this all by
 yourself

 Some people are so narrow minded they can see through a crack in a door with

 My opinions should be yours My employer has no opinions
 

An open letter to Marc Afifi


Dear Marc
	I believe that you are wrong about Mr Freeman  He has written in
a style that raises the level of posts on this board  If you just dont seem
to get it I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities
than of him  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions 
well
	Having said this I would like to ask in general for people on this 
board to realize that if they dont agree with the substance of posts then they should respond to the substance or lack of of the posts rather than attack
the author of the posts  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what heshe has written one can see that that person does not have the
ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post

Peace


Danny
