     A Four
    
     Two fasten his arms one shoots in the face
     and one writes up a false report
    

Making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything not
mentioning peace or agreement I also know several tens of jokes about arabs
palestinians but I DO NOT post them to Usenet Anywaynot to THIS newsgroup
since I dont think I will achieve any target but making other parts furiousand
this is NOT my target
If this is your targetwellthat tells a lot about you


 Can Nick Steel provide documentation for this alleged incident 

Did you really think he is talking about something realistic


 Harry

 You must be kidding this is not a single incident
 now This has become a daily life practice in Gazza
 if you mean the killing of children by armed soldiers

Yeahwellsometimeswhen cowards put their children and wives in the front line
so their enemy cannot do anythingwellmaybe in those casesyou have no better
thing to do to save your life than shooting And if parents want their
children aliveI think it would be better that before they get out to throw
stonesmolotov botllesor when they come to kill solidersto keep their children
in the houses


 If you are objecting the number of occupying israeli
  soldiers terrorists or  the way they do it  then
             
                         Look in the dictionary at the word terrorism It
			 says nu the use of threats of violenceand violence
			 esp for political purposes
			 It sounds more like your guys

 I caan assure you that they do worse than that Just as

Yeah WellI guess you were in thereand you know it all

 example  11 children were killed this month of Ramadhan
 two of them by military vehicules  An other similar
 incident by vehicule was the one of 25 Feb 4 Ramadhan
 where thee military truck on purpose hit a passenger
                             
                           Where from do you know that it was on purpose
			   PersonallyI didnt hear about this casealthough
			   I dont deny itBut how can ANYBODYbesides the
			   person itselfcan say it was on purpose

 car where the victims were a 5 year girl Safa Sail
 Bisharat
 and Saamud Riyad a 2 weeks old babygirl  the 23
 oldd Raajij Rouhy

YeahsureThe truck driver looked in the car with his Zionist Equipment of
Detecting Palestinian Childrenand then he thought to himselfHey there is a
5 year  and 2 weeks girls in the carWhy wont I make an accident and kill
the enemy Maximum I will die too in the crashBut what do I care

Actually if can remember correctly was it not reported and even on camera
some time during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon or when the itifada began
that CNN caught regular uniformed Israeli soldiers breaking the arms of
some Arab youngsters in a very professional and brutal manner someone
please give full details if they can remember This is one of the few

WellIt was about 3 years ago in the Intifada The fact that  you cant
remember the time prooves how much do you care about it I DO NOT think
that what the soliders did was correct But I will not agree that they were
breaking their armsI saw that filmandunlike in the USAit was broadcasted
entirely not long ago in a talk show and at the end the armbroken guys got
up and walked and used their arms very good They guy who did it was interviewed
and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take
his ordersand spitted in his face What ammount of truth exist in this
statement I cannot tell youbecause I wasnt there But the guy who did it was
in prisonif it makes you any good

occassions on which such a scene has been transmitted to the West and
in the USA  it caused uproar and was one of the factors that has significantly
changed the preception of the Israeli armys role in the mideast

Noit didnt The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle
eastIt is still the only human armyas much as an ARMY can be humanTo any
American who will claim the oppositeI can only remember the CNN broadcasting
of the American Solider who beat a Somalian boy It was very cruel to seeBut
I wont say because of this that the American army is cruel


So there is proof for you It is obvious that is a systematic policy of the
Israelis which must be occurring on a massive scale behind the scenes

Some kind of proof Obvious Where from If you say it is behind the scenes
how do you know about it
