Subject Re Israeli Expansionlust


In a previous article zbibbnrca Sam Zbib says

IMHO it does not really matter who started any individual battle within 
the ArabsIsreal war context The real question is whowhat  started the 
War Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab 
land  

Where the hell do you get off calling it Arab land  Jews have been
living there for a long time  Jews didnt just start arriving in 1900
theyve been living there for thousands of years except for periods when
they were expelled but they always returned home
