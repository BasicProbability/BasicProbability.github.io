Subject XSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide

In article C5LxEw9p0panixcom mpolypanixcom Michael S Polymenakos writes

 Maybe with the availability of anon servers some people are beginning to
speak out 

I sure hope so Because the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must 
be righted Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of 
Urartus massacred and exterminated its population and presented to 
the world all those left from the Urartus as the Armenian civilization

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly
exterminated 25 million Muslim women children and elderly people of 
Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the 
Ottoman Empire between 19141920

It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators
of the Nazis during World War II and that even today criminalNazi
members of the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate
racism hatred violence and terrorism among peoples 

And xSoviet Armenia continues its antiTurkish policy in the following 
ways

1 xSoviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility

2 xSoviet Armenia employing ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle and criminalNazi Armenians attempts to call into question the 
veracity of the Turkish Genocide

3 xSoviet Armenia has also implemented statesponsored terrorism through
the ASALASDPAARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish peoples vehement demands and protests

4 Using all its human financial and governmental resources xSoviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism bribery and other subversive methods nonTurkish supporters
of the Turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian

Using all the aforementioned methods the xSoviet Armenian government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue

Yet despite the efforts of the xSoviet Armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle 
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and 
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become 
supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks 
                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination
