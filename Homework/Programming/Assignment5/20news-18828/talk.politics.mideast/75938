Subject Himmlers speech on the extirpation of the Jewish race


 WASHINGTON  A stark reminder of the Holocausta speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to the extermination of the
Jewish racewent on display Friday at the National Archives
	The documents including handwritten notes by Himmler are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth archivists say
	The notes give them their authenticity said Robert Wolfe
a supervisory archivist for captured German records  He was
supposed to destroy them  Like a lot of bosses he didnt obey his
own rules
	The documents moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg Austria
	Himmler spoke on Oct4 1943 in Posen Poland to more than
100 German secret police generals  I also want to talk to you
quite frankly on a very grave matter  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly and yet we will never speak of it publicly
I mean the clearing out of the Jew the extermination of the Jewish
race  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written  Emphasis minerje
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
extermination is Ausrottung
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be extirpation
or tearing up by the roots
	In his handwritten notes Himmler used a euphemism
Judenevakuierung or evacuation of the Jews  But archives
officials said extermination is the word he actually
spokepreserved on an audiotape in the archives
	Himmler who oversaw Adolf Hitlers final solution of the
Jewish question committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945
	The National Archives exhibit on display through May 16 is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmlers handwritten notes a typed transcript from the speech and
an offical translation made for the Nuremberg war crimes trials
