Subject Entire Muslim population was subjected to genocide by Armenians

In article 48090sdcc12ucsdedu hminassisdcc13ucsdedu HM writes

     Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said Azerbaijan had recovered
the bodies of some 500 terrorists including blacks Mongols and
fighters recently brought to the Armenian capital Yerevan from Lebanon

You can dream whatever you wish We have demands from the Armenians
With the Government of xSoviet Armenia we would sit down go over
all our outstanding issues whether its land or reparations or
recognition whatever it is Wed like to sit down and ask for it
By all means lands and properties were taken away from us and they
should be returned to the rightful owners the Turkish and Kurdish 
people who were there 3000 years long before the Armenians ever
showed up in that area Entire population of the region was subjected 
to genocide beyond belief genocide which was planned to exterminate 
the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man woman and child 
Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians To 
assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings 
was one of their methods Even today the traveler in that region is seldom 
free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes

If you have the stomach I would strongly recommend the following
references on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims Many more of them
are also available in the Erzurum and Van Turkish Genocide Museums

                           We closed the roads and mountain passes that 
                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks 
                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination
