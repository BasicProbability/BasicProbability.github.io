Armenian Government what was your role in the murder of Orhan Gunduz and 
Kemal Arikan How many more Muslims will be slaughtered by SDPAORG as

	witness who gave a description of the murderer is shot down  He 
	survives but falls silent One of the most revolting triumphs in 
	the senseless mindless history of Armenian terrorism Such a murder 
	brings absolutely nothing  except an ego boost for the murderer 
	within the Armenian terrorist underworld which is already wallowing 
	in selfsatisfaction
 
Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak

Meeting The Armenian Reporter May 1 1986 pp 1  18

ATHENS Greece  An array of representatives of Greek political parties
including the ruling PASOK party and a host of political groups both
Armenian and nonArmenian joined to voice their solidarity with the 
Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday April 20 during
the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People And
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations at least here in Greece the Armenian
Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world

The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of
the Armenian Popular Movement a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of Armenians who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia
ASALA The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern
countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of ASALA

Voicing the support of PASOK the ruling party in Greece to the Armenian
people was Mr Charalambidi Michalis a member of the Central Committee of
the party and the Greek member of the Permanent Peoples Tribunal
Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement 
was Ara Sarkisian Significant was the address delivered by Mr Bassam 
AbuSalim on behalf of the Popular Front for the movements continued 
support of the Armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause 
pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be 
open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle Later Mr 
AbuSalim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that 
his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that
this policy will continue The doors of our camps are always open to 
Armenian freedom fighters he affirmed

Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of Prime Minister Papandreou who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet
two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of
the Christian Democratic party EDIK Center party two wings of the Communist
party representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations
a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities two Greek members of the
European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference Also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens

More than significant was the large number of messages received by the 
organizers including the following Palestinian National Revolutionary
Movement Fatah Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineGeneral
Command the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation
MovementFatah the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon Arab Socialist
Labor Party the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq and numerous other
international groups all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli
Palestinian conflict

                 SUPPORT FROM ARFRM

Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary
FederationRevolutionary Movement the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers The message clearly gave its support to the
Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will
continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are
to expose the antiArmenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag Bureau
The message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that
exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement
open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle

The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
Greek capital known as Neos Kosmos where there is a large Armenian presence
The headquarters are located in a twostory building which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves

 Source Adventures in the Near East 19181922 by A Rawlinson
 Jonathan Cape 30 Bedford Square London 1934 First published 1923 
 287 pages

DD Such a pile of garbage First off the above reference was first published
DD in 1924 NOT 1923 and has 353 pages NOT 287 Second upon checking page 
DD 178 we are asked to believe
 
VD No MrDavidian  
 
VD  It was first published IN 1923 I have the book on my desknow 
VD                         
 
VD  and furthermorethe book I have does not have 353 pages either as you
VD  claimed MrDavidianIt has 377 pagesAny question
  
Well it seems YOUR book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the 
ncrap posted by Mr 
 
 o boy   
 
 Please can you tell us why those quotes are crapbecause you do not 
 like thembecause they really existwhy
 
 As I said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic  
  
 You couldnt reject it
 

In addition the Authors Preface was written on January 15 1923 BUT THE BOOK
was published in 1924
 
 Here we go again
 In the book I have both the front page and the Authors preface give 
 the same year 1923 and 15 January 1923 respectively
 Anyone can check it at herhis libraryif not I can send you the copies of
 pages please ask by sct 
 
 
I really dont care what year it was first published1923 or 1924
What I care about is what the book writes about murders torturesetin
the given quotes by Serdar Argic and your denial of these quotesand your
groundless accussations etc 
 


 
DD I can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim
 
VD what is new
 
I will post a gif file but I am not going go through the effort to show there 
is some Turkish modified republication of the book like last time
 
 
 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923first publication
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934Serdar Argics Reference hasYou couldnt reject itbut now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around
 
 Lets see how you liefrom nonexisting quotes to republication
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceYou
 called Serdar Argic a liar
 I said to you NO MRDavidian there exactly existed such a quote
 I even gave the call number page numbersyou couldt reject it
 
 And now you are lying again and talking about modifiedrepublished book
without any proof how when where by whom etc
 by the way how is it possible to republish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924your claimI am sure that you have some pretty 
  well suited theories as usual
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and MrDavidians liesI also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use which are  
                 9496 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes218 and 215
              
     
 
 
It is not possible that s text has 287 pages mine has 353 and yours has
377
 
 Now are you claiming that there cant be such a reference by saying it is
 not possible If not what is your point
 
 Differences in the number of pages
 Mine was published in 1923Serdar Argics was in 1934
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year
 first published 
 And you tried to hide the whole point
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed torturedetc by Armeniansand those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist 
 It was the issue wasntit  
 
 you were not able to object itDoes it bother you anyway 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders by Armenians as a crap
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many craps in the 1993 
 
 Any question
