Lets not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered The
distinction is not trivial Murder happens to innocent people not people
whose line of work is to kill or be killed It just so happened that these
soldiers in the line of duty were killed by the opposition 

That still doesnt mean we should cheer their deaths  Policemen are also in 
the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed  
Should we be happy when they die  As I said before the question is not
whether or not you agree with the policies of Israel  You may wish for the
Israelis to cease occupation but dont rejoice in death
