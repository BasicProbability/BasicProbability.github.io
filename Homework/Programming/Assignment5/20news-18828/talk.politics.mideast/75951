What the hell do you know about Israeli policy  What gives you the fiat
to look into the minds of Israeli generals  Has this policy of intimidation
been published somewhere  For your information the actions taken by Arabs
specifically the PLO were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982  My
brain is full of shit  At least I dont look into the minds of others and 
make Israeli policy for them

I am not in the business of reading minds however in this case it would not
be necessary  Israelis top leaders in the past and present always come across
as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs  

How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or
burn half your conuntry  Would you talk nicely  Would you say please  You
wouldnt  The language of the middle east is power and force  Sorry  that
is the way it is now  If you arent strong you go down  Israel has to talk 
and act tough  Notice Israel talks and acts tough in battle but is willing
to talk peace

The way I see it Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons

 1 Arab governments are not really representative of their people currently
    most of their leaders are stupid andor not independent andor
    dictators

True  and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort
of monsters  Arab nonrecognition of Israel and support of war and terror
is also an important factor wouldnt you say

 2 Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising

What do you want Israel to do  They are negotating Im sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now  Thats not realistic dont
you realize that  A solution must be negotiated  It is on the table  Have
patience
