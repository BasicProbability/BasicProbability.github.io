 One of my biggest complaints about using the word fundamentalist
 is that at least in the USA people speak of muslime
 fundamentalists                                  muslim
 but nobody defines what a jewish or christan fundamentalist is
 I wonder what an equal definition would be
 any takers

Well I would go as far as saying that Naturei Karta are definitely
Jewish fundamentalists  Other ultraorthodox Jewish groups might very
well be though I am hesitant of making such a broad generalization
