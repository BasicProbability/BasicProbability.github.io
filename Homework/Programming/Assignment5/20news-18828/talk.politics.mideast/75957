FARID In support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of 
FARID Azerbaijan and its independence from Russian rule the Iranians which 
FARID includes millions of Azerbaijanis will have Armenia retreat from the 
FARID territory of Azerbaijan 

Oh they will This should prove quite interesting

FARID To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will 
FARID be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in 
FARID violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation 

Armenia is not counting on Iranian help As far as violations of international
laws which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and 
depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh

FARID If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan not 
FARID only there wont be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will 
FARID be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia 

And who do you speak for Rafsanjani

FARID The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy As for 
FARID scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power experts on present 
FARID and future military potentials of these people would not put much 
FARID stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long 

Well Farid your supposed experts are not expert The Russians have had
nonstop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828
Hmm that makes it 19931828  165 years 

Oh I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from 
Karabakh That will be a real good trick 

FARID Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb 
FARID and a reliable delivery system refer to recent news releases 
FARID regarding the potential of Iran 

So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by
forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians

FARID The moral of the story is that you dont go invading your neighbors 
FARID home Azerbaijan and flash Russias guns when questioned about it 

Oh but its just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor You are
a damn fool Farid

FARID Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a 
FARID few short years 

So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well 

FARID Peaceful resolution of the ArmenianAzerbaijani conflict is the only 
FARID way to go Armenia may soon find the fruits of Aggression very bitter 
FARID indeed

And the Armenians will take your peaceful dropping of an atomic bomb as
an example of Iranian Azeri benevolence You sir are a poor example of an 
Iranian Azeri 

Ha And to think I had a nice two day stay in Tabriz back in 1978
