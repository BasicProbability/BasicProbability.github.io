Hezbollah and other Lebanese Resistance fighters are skilled at precision
bombing of SLA and Israeli targets 

Its hard to beat a carbomb with a suicidal driver in getting 
right up to the target before blowing up  Even boobytraps and
radiocontrolled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers  
You have a point   

I find such methods to be far more
restrained and responsible 

Is this part of your Islamic valuesystem

than the Israeli method of shelling and bombing
villages with the hope that a Hezbollah member will be killed along with
the civilians murdered 

Had Israeli methods been anything like this then Iraq wouldnve been
nuked long ago entire Arab towns deported and executions performed by
the tens of thousands  The fact is though that Israeli methods
arent even 110000th as evil as those which are common and everyday
in Arab states

Soldiers are trained to die for their country Three IDF soldiers
did their duty the other day These men need not have died if their government
had kept them on Israeli soil 

Israeli soil  BradAli  Just wait until the Ayatollahs
thoughtpolice get wind of this  Its all Holy Muslim Soil tm
Have you forgotten  May Allah have mercy on you now
