	1 nehzate aazaadees member have many times been arrested
	and tortured and as we speak some of them are still in prison

	2 The above item confirms the long standing suspicion that 
	the only reason this regime has not destroyed nehzate
	aazaadee completely is just to show off and brag about the
	freedom of expression in Iran in its propaganda paper

	Get serious  If this regime had its way there would be 
	absolutely no freedom of expression anywhere not even in SCI  
						      

there really isnt as seen by the heavy usage of anonymous posting  
if iri sympathizers didnt roam around in sci anonposter would 
get used only occasionally as in the good old days
