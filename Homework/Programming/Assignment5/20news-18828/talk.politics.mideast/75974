IMHO it does not really matter who started any individual battle within 
the ArabsIsreal war context The real question is whowhat  started the 
War Does anyone have any doubts it was the creation of Israel on Arab 
land  
	Huh  A war was started when several armies invaded Israel
vowing to drive the Jews into the sea  Most Jews wanted to live in
peace and the Arabs who stayed in Israel were granted citizenship

 I am
surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by
the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive
state as a hostile action leading to war

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an
exclusive state  If the state was to be exclusive it would not have
400 000 arab citizens

	And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
action  When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing
to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce  It
is not a hostile action leading to war

As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace maybe
However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish
state where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of
the land  Living in peace is meaningless unless it means
living WITH someone else as equal For a native arab this 
does not leave many options

	Oh you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens  The
arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who
they vote for as the Jews

Those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what 
happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless
and ineffective minority
If I were wrong youd have Israel recall all the
palestinian refugees were talking millions After all
they are civilians 

	Huh  The people who left did so voluntarily  There is no
reason for Israel to let them in

Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it
had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid
flowing

	Israel got no western aid in 1948 nor in 1949 or 50It
still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained  And how
is granting citizenship a facade

	Tell me something Sam  What makes land arab

How shall I explain Its a contract between the man and the
land  Control isnt it The Ottomans ruled 400 years and
then left with barely a trace  The concept of Land identity
is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic West  It is
partly the concept of le sol natal native soil  I know
that jews had previous history in the region but none in
recent memory  Im talking everyday life not archeology

	Try again you tell me what its isnt but you fail to
establish what it is

	Also Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand
years  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel
There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 12001500
Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards  Does that
make the land Jewish
