Subject Re Fundamentalism  again

One of my biggest complaints about using the word fundamentalist
is that at least in the USA people speak of muslime
fundamentalists                                  muslim
but nobody defines what a jewish or christan fundamentalist is
I wonder what an equal definition would be
any takers

	The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to
refer to both Christians and Jews  Christian fundementalists are
often refered to in the context of antiabortion protests  The
American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in
Judea Samaria or Gaza and to any Jew who follows the torah
