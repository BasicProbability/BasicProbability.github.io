In article 1993Apr1412581321737ncsuedu hernlemchessncsuedu Brad Hernlem writes

 Lebanese resistance forces detonated a bomb under an Israeli occupation
 patrol in Lebanese territory two days ago Three soldiers were killed and
 two wounded In retaliation Israeli and Israelibacked forces wounded
 8 civilians by bombarding several Lebanese villages Ironically the Israeli
 government justifies its occupation in Lebanon by claiming that it is
 necessary to prevent such bombardments of Israeli villages

 Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance With every
 Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral
 bankruptcy of Israels occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli
 governments policy of reckless disregard for civilian life

Im sure the Federal Bureau of Investigation fbigov on the Internet is going
to love reading your incitement to murder
