Subject Clintons views on Jerusalem

I recently read that during Bill Clintons campaign he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israels capital  According to the article Mr Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency  However
during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of
State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties

Now I dont want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem  All I want to know is if anyone can 
authenticate Mr Clintons statements with dates places etc

Thank you

Ben
