  Well you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli 
  patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the retaliatory
  shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israelibacked forces My team
  you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the
  faces of the spectators in my teams viewing stands so to speak 
  
  I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
  in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda There are no a priori
  black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in 
  retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the
  Lebanese terrorists
  
  If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable But this is not the
  issue The issue is that you were cheering DEATH

 Dorin of all the criticism of my post expressed on tpm this one I accept
 I regret that aspect of my post It is my hope that the occupation will end and
 the accompanying loss of life but I believe that stiff resistance can help to 
 achieve that end Despite what some have said on tpm I think that there is 
 a point when losses are unacceptable The strategy drove US troops out of 
 Lebanon at least

Hi Brad

I have two comments  Regarding your hope that the occupation will end 
belive that stiff resistanceetc  how about an untried approach ie
peace and cooperation  I cant help but wonder what would happen if all
violence against Israelis stopped  Hopefully violence against Arabs
would stop at the same time  If a state of nonviolence could be 
maintained perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved ie
greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the
territories  

Of course given the current leadership of Israel your way may work
also  but if that leadership changes eg to someone with Ariel
Sharons mentality then I would predict a considerable loss of life
ie no winners

Secondly regarding your comment about the US troops responding
to stiff resistance  the analogy is not quite valid  The US
troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether  The Israelis
could not

Just my 02 worth no offense intended

Respectfully     

Ben
