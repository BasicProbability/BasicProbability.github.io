 A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
  by
 			  Elias Davidsson

 
 1      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
 for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
 and the other PalestinianArab
 
 2      To be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove
 that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli
 citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner
 although born in areas under current Isreali control is not
 entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return
 
 3      For the first child the grant will amount to 18000 For
 the second the third child 12000 for each child For each
 subsequent child the grant will amount to 6000 for each child


 I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as
 well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful
 discussion and enrichment

Maybe Im a bit oldfashioned but have you heard about something
called Love It used to play some role in peoples considerations
for getting married Of course I know some people who married 
fictitiously in order to get a green card but making a common
child for 18000 The power of AA is limited Your proposal is
indeed unconventional
