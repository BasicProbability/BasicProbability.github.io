 While you brought up the separate question of Israels unjustified
 policies and practices I am still unclear about your reaction to
 the practices and polocies reflected in the article above

Not a separate question Mr Clock It is deceiving to judge the 
resistance movement out of the context of the occupation

Alaa Zeineldine

When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became in parts of Lebanon an
Occupying Power itself these same practices were common against
nonPalestinean and Palestinean alike  They are simply Standard
Operating Procedures among Palestineans and have been for a very long
time  In fact the greatest bloodbath of Palestineans will happen
when they get selfrule  Can you possibly deny this 

When the PLO is the Occupier who are you NOW going to blame
