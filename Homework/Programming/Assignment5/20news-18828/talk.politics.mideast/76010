henrikLet me clearify Mr Turkish

henrik KNOW that SHE WILL NO  LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get 
henrik away with their FAMOUS tricks Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH 
henrik invasion of the Greek island of CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED 


Esin Terzioglu  Your ignorance is obvious from your posting 
Esin Terzioglu  1 Cyprus was an INDEPENDENT country with TurkishGreek 
		    inhabitants NOT a Greek island like your ignorant 
			posting claims
Esin Terzioglu  2 The name should be Cyprus in English
Esin Terzioglu  next time read and learn before you post 



Aside from spelling  why is that you TURKS DO NOT want to admit your
past MISTAKES  You know TURKISH INVASION of CYPRUS was a mistake and too
bad that UN DID NOT do anything about it You may ask  mistake 
Yes I would say Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS 

My response to the shooting down of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian
air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your 
Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for 3000 years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS 
BY STALIN are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending 
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT 
people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG23s and othe Russian aircraft 

At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH 
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again
