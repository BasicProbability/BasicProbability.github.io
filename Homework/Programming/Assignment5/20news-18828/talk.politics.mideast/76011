   First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an
intermarriage process and then says that it will be just a bunch
of fundamentalist Jews who will object  

Or does he simply mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 
fundamentalist

Its irritating when someone mislabels us as fundamentalists
isnt it  This sort of thing may help us understand why some muslims 
rather resent being put under this label
