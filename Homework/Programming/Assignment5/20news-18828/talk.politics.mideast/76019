 Ten questions to Israelis
 
 
 I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
 provide
  accurate answers to the following specific questions These are
 indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
 people around me                                      
 
 1      Is it true that the Israeli authorities dont recognize
 Israeli nationality  And that ID cards which Israeli citizens
 must carry at all times identify people as Jews or Arabs not as
 Israelis 


	Thats true Israeli ID cards do not identify people
	as Israelies Smart huh


 3      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons  If so
 could you provide any evidence 

	Yes Theres one warhead in my parents backyard in
	Beer Sheva thats only some 20 miles from Dimona
	you know Evidence I saw it

 
 4      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
 individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
 identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
 state secrets 

	Yes But unfortunately I cant give you more details
	Thats secret you see
