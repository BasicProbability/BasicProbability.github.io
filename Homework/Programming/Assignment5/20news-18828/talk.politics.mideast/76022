My response to the shooting down of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian
air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your 
Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for 3000 years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS 
BY STALIN are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending 
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT 
people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG23s and othe Russian aircraft 

At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH 
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again


Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan  It is Armenian
soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan
You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
only in that region  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
organized have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
repeatedly  

I dont wish to get into the Cyprus discussion  Turkey had the right to
intervene and it did  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
last for so long but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
for the ongoing standoff in the region  

Lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia  I vote yes for it
After all it is now free
