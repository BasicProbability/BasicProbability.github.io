henrik  My response to the shooting down of a Turkish airplane over the 
henrik  Armenian air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the 
henrik  person from your Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to 
henrik  drag ARMENIA into the KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan The 
henrik  KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik  years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN are 
henrik  the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending 
henrik  themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION Agression that has NO MERCY 
henrik  for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG23s and 
henrik  othe Russian aircraft 

henrik  At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik  KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL 
henrik  NEVER OCCUR again

DA Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan  It is Armenian
DA soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan

    Well this is your opinion  

    Turkish Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE However 
    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIAs involvement if 
    KARABAKHIArmenians had had HEAVY losses


DA You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
DA only in that region  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
DA organized have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
DA repeatedly  

	Read what  The New York Times  that is publishing antiarmenian
	articles Nop I have my resources Look everyone knows how aggressive
        TurksAzeris have been in the past Armenians ARE NOT gona sit
	around and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS 

DA It seems to me that the Armenians are better organized have more success 
DA militarily and shell Azeri towns repeatedly  

	Buch of nonsence CRAP and you know it Who the hell you think
        you are talking to  Azeris are FIGHTING LOCAL ARMENIANS in 
	NagarnoKarabakh You tell me who has more MIGs  Freedom fighters
        in NagarnoKarabakh or Azerbaijan 

	Again I will say it for the last time ARMENIA is NOT involved
        in this WAR and you guys WANT to bring this up in order to cover 
        up the Turkish involvment in the Karabakh Go ahead  REPEAT as 
	much as you want 

DA I dont wish to get into the Cyprus discussion  Turkey had the right to
DA intervene and it did  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
DA last for so long but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
DA on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
DA for the ongoing standoff in the region  

	Not a chance  You CAN NOT convince me based on your REASONSthat 
	your GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS 

DA Lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia  I vote yes for it
DA After all it is now free  

	Well I am NOT in the position to agree or disadree with you
