h 	The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS
h        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their 
h        territorium
	
HE	Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE	Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
HE	are their homeland Cant you see the
HE	the  Great Armenia dream in this

Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh to the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean so if you use the term Greater Armenia use it with care

HE    With facist methods like
HE	killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the 
HE	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees trying to
HE	escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
HE	by the Armenians 

It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh 
by removing the Armenians When the president of Azerbaijan Elchibey came to 
power last year he announced he would be be swimming in Lake Sevan in 
Armeniaxn by July Well he was wrong If Elchibey is going to shell the 
Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam his people will pay the price If Elchibey 
is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price If 
Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of 
Kelbajar his people will pay the price 

It also seems other nonAzeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they
are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation Just 
look at the situation with the Lezgians

About the Kurdswhat Kurds According to the Azerbaijani government there 
are no Kurds in Azerbaijan Cant they make up their minds Oh I see there 
are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds And anyway this 60 
Kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in 
Baku modified in Ankara Other examples of this are Armenia has no border 
with Iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of Armenian military 
conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by 
somebody unknown from Armenian into Azeri Turkish submitted by an unnamed 
special correspondent to the NY Times from Baku Real accurate

h       However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane 
h       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
h       that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
h       carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA

No Henrik these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked

HE	Dont speak about things you dont know 8 American Cargo planes
HE	were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
HE	announced that they were going to search these cargo 
HE	planes 3 of these planes returned to its base in Germany
HE	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
HE	of the other 3 planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
HE	humanitarian aid

Your facts in error Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey 
have been either searched rerouted or confiscated Some American planes
were searched others were rerouted others were untouched Rail shipments 
were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey
for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia Wheat was
confiscated other shipments were exchanged with crap and dirt then
shipped to Armenia US planes dont have to use Turkish air bases The US
uses these bases to bomb Iraq Anyway US planes can fly over Georgia which
they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish 
chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed 
anything other than a paranoid Turkish military 

HE	Search Turkish planes You dont know what you are talking about
HE	since its content is announced to be weapons 

Well big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan
from Turkey yet Demirel and others say no No wonder you are so confused

HE	Turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons
HE	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE	it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
HE	since its content is announced to be weapons 

You are correct all Turkish planes should be simply shot down Nice slow
moving air transports
