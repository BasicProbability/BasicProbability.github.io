henrik  Country Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
henrik  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan 

BM Gimme a break  CAPITAL letters or NOT the above is pure nonsense  It
BM seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities
			
henrik	Again Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves What do
henrik	want them to do Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them

News reports Ive seen say otherwise both location and motives wise  
CAPS dont change facts

BM while hoping that Turkey will stay out  Stop and think for a moment
BM will you  Armenia doesnt need anyone to drag her into the conflict it
BM is a part of it  

henrik   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged 
henrik   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHIArmenians

So  Should I at this point break into caps and start talking about 
DEFENSE etc  I dont know how fully engaged Turkey iswas though

henrik The KARABAKHIARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik years CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN are the 
henrik ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT They are defending 
henrik themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION 

BM Huh  You didnt expect Azeris to be friendly to forces fighting with them
BM  within their borders  

henrik Well history is SAD Remember those are relocated Azeris into 
henrik the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime

So I hear  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact

henrik At last I hope that the US insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER 
henrik OCCUR again

BM Youre not playing with a full deck are you  Where would Turkey invade

henrik It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped
henrik into Armenia if SHE could

Why would Turkey do that  Do you not realize that this is a local clash
that Turkey never wished to see happen  Turkey has other plans for region
like economic revival cooperation etc  Good stuff in other words  Id
be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET
rather than who killed whom in what way which I detest doing and wouldnt 
do  

BM Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with scg in the header
BM in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun  

henrik	   Absolutely NOT  I am merely trying to emphasize that in many
henrik	   cases HISTORY repeats itself 

Even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would
be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in 74  If thered been
a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the
time everybody would have stayed home with their families  I have no
wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel but I suspect what Ive said is not
only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved

BM Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes 
BM she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM the parties to the negotiating table  Thats hard to do when Armenians 
BM are attacking Azeri towns

henrik	   So let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying Turkey
henrik	   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT NOT 

So what do you think we want  War death and destruction  

henrik	   I will believe it when I see it

No if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it

henrik  Now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
henrikto your HEAD  Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yourseffat chance
	
This kind of childish rhetoric doesnt help anthing

henrik  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU  All the
henrik  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN I mean
henrik  BURNING people ALIVE 

Now some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff
perpetrated by Armenians  One should rehash stuff like this often to
keep the hatred alive right

BM Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
BMfutility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
BM leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis thats 
BM going to cause incessant skirmishes  

henrik	   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic They are 
henrik	   NOT asking much They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY 
henrik	   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN 

Well they obviously arent getting anywhere with their current methods
of asking not very peaceful Id say

BM Think of 10 or 20 years down the line  both of the newly independent 
BM countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe 
BM the other out   These people will be neighbors would it not be better 
BM to keep the bad blood between them minimal

henrik	   Dont get me WRONG I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
henrik	   conflict But until Azeris realize that the Armenians in
henrik	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion

I dont know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans
Peace isnt whats happening right now furthermore whats happening
right now isnt condusive to peace  You can spend days and nights 
raving about how right the Armenian position is and Im sure
therell be others whod be happy to talk to you by arguing the other
side  If entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace
than they should sit down and talk about a compromise  Armenia isnt
strong enough to exercise the we think were right and we have the 
bombs so well do whatever we want so there style of foreign 
relations  Yes you can type Stalin in caps and give one sided
atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to 
the other side  You personally can choose not to do that of course
this being just USENET  The people in power shouldnt be so childish


BM If you belong to the Armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes
BM your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of 
BM their blood and future 

henrik	   Again you are taking different TURNS Armenia HAS no intension
henrik	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan The Armenians in KARABAKH
henrik	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET

Azeris would disagree with you on this and the maps Ive seen support
what theyd be saying  It doesnt seem likely that a solution will be
reached in this manner  

BM Its easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
BM craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled  The Armenians
BM in Armenia and NK will be there with the same people you seem to hate 
BM as their neighbors for maybe 3000 years more  The sooner theres peace in
BM the region the better it is for them and everyone else  Id push for
BM compromise if I were you instead of hitting the capslock and spreading
BM inflammatory halftruths

henrik   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative I am absolutely
henrik   for it 

It didnt look it when I read your posting  It would seem to me 
that if you can spew misinformation about a boogeyman you can also
talk about how one might avoid the nastiness  Fair

henrik But in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself
henrik you will be WIPED out Such as the case in the era of 191520 of
henrik The Armenian Massacres

You dont realize I can say the same thing about The Turkish Massacres
Yes boys and girls lets always talk about how bad and nasty things were
Lets do that so were overwhelmed by anger and lets do that so our
kids will also be hateful  Sounds crazy doesnt it  Dont do it then

BM
