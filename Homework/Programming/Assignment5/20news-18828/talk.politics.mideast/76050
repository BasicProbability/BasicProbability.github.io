 I was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering
 Like I said Im not an Arab but if I was say a Lebanese you bet
 I would defende my homeland against any invader by any means
                                       
The Syrians  Iranian agents  Or just Israeli invaders

            I dont even agree with some of my opinions           or die  
   


I did say any invader didnt I  What do you want from me perhaps a neural
net design with all countries involved in Lebanon as its nodes   You are
in Cognitive and Neural Systems

If thats the case I would put different weights for each country in my
net
