    Well this is your opinion  


Of course it is  

    Turkish Azeris can BARK all they WANT since the ABOVE is UNTRUE However 
    I am sure YOU GUYS would have NEVER brought up ARMENIAs involvement if 
    KARABAKHIArmenians had had HEAVY losses


And this is your opinion  It is not any more valid due to repeated
capital letters and words such as untrue never etc  

	Read what  The New York Times  that is publishing antiarmenian
	articles Nop I have my resources Look everyone knows how aggressive
        TurksAzeris have been in the past Armenians ARE NOT gona sit
	around and watch FIRE WORKS by AZERIS taught by TURKS 

So Armenians are justified in aggression since supposedly Turks have
been aggressive in the past  I dont follow your logic  

DA I dont wish to get into the Cyprus discussion  Turkey had the right to

	Not a chance  You CAN NOT convince me based on your REASONSthat 
	your GOVERNMENT did the RIGHT thing to invade CYPRUS 

I have said that I dont wish to get into Cyprus discussion and did not
give any reasons for Turkeys involvement  I also am not trying to
convince you of anything seeing no reason to waste any time 

DA Lastly why is there not a socculturearmenia  I vote yes for it
DA After all it is now free  

	Well I am NOT in the position to agree or disadree with you

	

I am serious  Lets get socculturearmenia started and have some peace
of mind
