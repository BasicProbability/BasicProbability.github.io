In ReSyrias Expansion the author writes that the UN thought
Zionism was Racism and that they were wrong  They were correct
the first time Zionism is Racism and thankfully the McGill Daily
the student newspaper at McGill was proud enough to print an article
saying so  If you want a copy send me mail

I know this paper well and see it for the exercise in selective morality 
and judgement it is Until such time as it recognizes that any religiously
based government is racist exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy
of separate but equal secondclass treatment of minorities it will 
continue to be known for its bias If Jewish nationalism is racism so is 
Islam anywhere where people are allotted different rights according to 
race religion or culture is racist
