Subject Ten questions about Israel

I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
provide
 accurate answers to the following specific questions These are
indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
people around me

  questions omitted  

Elias Davidsson Iceland email   eliasismenntis

Funny you should mention it but Ive heard these questions time
and again also  Why just the other day a couple neoNazis by
UCLA were passing out literature like this
Cheers
Steve
