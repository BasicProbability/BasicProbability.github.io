DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN

   Born 1940
   Foreman

   Resident at Building 367 Apartment 9
   Block 14
   Sumgait Azerbaijan


During the first days of the events the 27th and the 28th of February I
was away on a business trip On the 10th I had got my crew done the paper
work and left for the Zhdanov District Thats in Azerbaijan near the
Nagorno Karabagh region

After the 14th rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh specifically
in Stepanakert an uprising had taken place They said uprising in
Azerbaijani but I dont think it was really an uprising just a 
demonstration After that the unrest started Several Armenians living in the 
Zhdanov District were injured How were they injured They were beaten even 
women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here 
and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate After that I felt uneasy There
were some conversations about Armenians among the local population the
Armenians had done this the Armenians had done that Right there at the site
I was attacked a couple of times by kids Well true the guys from my crew 
wouldnt let them come at me with cables and knives After that I felt really 
bad I didnt know where to go I up and called home And my children tell me
Theres unrest everywhere be careful Well I had a project going on I told
the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on 
and said I wanted to take my crew off the site They wouldnt allow it they 
said Nothings going to happen to you weve entrusted the matter to the 
police weve warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you 
Well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he 
knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened This
man didnt leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and 
afterward he spent the night with us too

I sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me The situation is
very tense be careful

We finished the job at the site and I left for Sumgait first thing on the
morning of the 29th When we left the guys warned me they told me that I
shouldnt tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian I took someone elses
business travel documents in the name of Zardali and hid my own I hid it 
and my passport in my socks We set out for Baku Our guys were on the bus 
they sat behind and I sat up front In Baku they had come to me and said that
they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case As it turns out 
they knew what was happening in Sumgait

I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is
closed there is no way to get there That the city is closed off and the 
buses arent running Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two
minutes And suddenlyno buses Well we tried to get there via private
drivers One man an Azerbaijani said Lets go find some other way to get
there They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to
take us to Sumgait

He took us there But the others had said I wouldnt go if you gave me a
thousand rubles Why Because theyre burning the city and killing the
Armenians There isnt an Armenian left Well I got hold of myself so I could
still stand up So we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we 
set off for Sumgait On the way the driver says In fact there arent any
Armenians left They burned them all beat them all and stabbed them Well 
I was silent The whole way20odd milesI was silent The driver asks me 
How old are you old man He wants to know if Im being that quiet not 
saying anything maybe it means Im an Armenian How old are you he asks 
me I say Im 47 Im 47 too but I call you old man I say It 
depends on God each persons life in this world is different I look much
older than my years thats why he called me old man Well after that he was
silent too

Were approaching the city I look and see tanks all around and a cordon
Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand Well he
was waving his hand we all start waving our hands Im sitting there with
them I start waving my hand too I realized that this was a sign that meant
there were no Armenians with us

I look at the citythere is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the 
street you know and theres no traffic Well probably I was scared They
stopped our car People were standing on the sidewalks They have armature 
shafts and stones    And they stopped us   

Along the way the driver tells us how they know whos an Armenian and whos 
not The Armenians usually    For example Im an Armenian but I speak 
their language very well Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for 
nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct The 
pronunciations are different Anyone who says pundukh even if theyre not 
Armenian they immediately take out and start to slash Another one says 
There was a car there with five people inside it he says They started 
hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire And they didnt let the
people out he says they wouldnt let them get out of the car I only saw 
the car but the driver says that he saw everything Well he often drives from
Baku to Sumgait and back   

When they stop us we all get out of the car I look and theres a short guy
his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in
the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one Were
Azerbaijani they tell him no Armenians here He did come up to me when 
we were pulling our things out and says Maybe youre an Armenian old man 
But in Azerbaijani I say You should be ashamed of yourself And    he 
left Turned and left That was all that happened What was I to do I had 
to    the city was on fire but I had to steal my children out of my own 
home

They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street thats where the Kavkaz store 
and three large 12story buildings are Thats the beginning of downtown I 
saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained I 
couldnt figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets Later I was told it 
was a Zhiguli And the people in there were completely incinerated Nothing 
remained of them not even any traces That driver had told me about it and I
saw the car myself The car was there The skeleton a metallic carcass About
30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store

I see a military transport an armored personnel carrier The hatches are
closed And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the
crowd is And I hear shots not automatic fire its true but pistol shots
Several shots There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier 
Someone in the crowd was shooting Apparently they either wanted to kill the 
soldiers or get a machine gun or something At that point there was only one 
armored personnel carrier And all the tanks were outside the city cordoning 
off Sumgait

I walked on I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant I can tell by 
their gait that theyre not bandits theyre just people walking home I
joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us
and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see
But I avoided the large groups because Im a local and might be quickly 
recognized I tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer
people Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2 which is across from our block
I cant get into our block but I walked where there were fewer people so as 
to get around Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking 
behind him And hes shouting into a megaphone Comrades the Armenian
Azerbaijani war has begun

The police have megaphones like that So theyre talking and walking around 
the second microdistrict I see that theyre coming my way and turn off 
behind a building I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings 
and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every
corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges What they were 
doing I cant say because I couldnt get up close to them I was afraid But 
the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least
find out if my children were alive or not
