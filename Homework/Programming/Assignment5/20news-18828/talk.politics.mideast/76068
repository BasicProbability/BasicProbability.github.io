 Henrik and Hilmi writes



henrik  The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their 
henrik  RIGHTS to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are 
henrik  INVADING their homeland



HE     Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE     Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
HE     are their homeland Cant you see the
HE     the  Great Armenia dream in this With facist methods like
HE     killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the
HE     blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees trying to
HE     escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
HE     by the Armenians



NagornoKarabakh is in Azerbaijan not Armenia Armenians have lived in Nagorno
Karabakh ever since there were Armenians Armenians used to live in the areas
between Armenia and NagornoKarabakh and this area is being used to invade 
Nagorno Karabakh Armenians are defending themselves If Azeris are dying
because of a policy of attacking Armenians then something is wrong with this 
policy		


 	Attacking Who is attacking who Even the country you live inUSA have condemned
	Armenia for its attacking And you start to say that the attackers
	are the Azeris
 	
	Armenians have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Armenians

	
	Azeris have lived in Nagorno Karabakh ever since there were Azeris
	Dont come with nonsence there is no reason to attack a people
	just because a man called Gorbatjov and co gave the freedom to the people
	in this area


If I recall correctly it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land
in the first place not the Armenians

	

	Its easy for people like you to blame history The were a lot of 
        Indians living in USA There is no reason for these 
	Indians to attack the American
	people and sayIt was the fault of the government of Germany and Great 
	Britain because they made people come to our place Armenians lived in
	harmony with the Azeris until Gorbatjov and co gave freedom to the people
	in Karabag then the Armenians started to kill rape and torture the Azeris not only
	in Karabag but also noe in Azerbadjan

henrik  However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
henrik  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
henrik  that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
henrik  carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA



HE     Dont speak about things you dont know 8 US Cargo planes
HE     were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
HE     announced that they were going to search these cargo
HE     planes 3 of these planes returned to its base in Germany
HE     5 of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
HE     of the other 3 planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
HE     humanitarian aid


What story are you talking about Planes from the US have been sending
aid into Armenian for two years I would not like to guess about what were in
the 3 planes in your story I would like to find out



HE     Search Turkish planes You dont know what you are talking about
HE     Turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons
HE     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE     it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
HE     since its content is announced to be weapons

	Its too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia	
 		
	  Thats what i dont want you couldnt imagine the result of a war
	  So France Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan 
	  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without 
	  saying it thats no secret any more


	  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted
	  Do they think that they shall move from its neigbours when the war
 	  is over The neighbour around will be there and Armenia must 	 
	  live in harmony with these if they dont want a stoneage country
	  for thats whats will happen Armenia if the wars continues
	
	  Look The President of Turkey Turgut Ozal died and  Petrosyan
	  the Armenian Presindent is now in Turkey for the funeral Is it because
	  he liked him Sure NOT because Armenia needs its neighbours and must
	  live with these But Armenia cant stop this war with continued ordertaking
	  from states like France and USA With other words if you love your people
	  you must think twice

	  And i wonder Shoot down turkish planes WITH WHAT ohhh i forgot
	  the Armenians cant find food but there are a lot of arms from the mentioned
	  countries
