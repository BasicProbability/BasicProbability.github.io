It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my postingI recieved a couple of letters toosome has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern worldThose who contest this statement present the figures of the World War IIHowever we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop ittoday is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILLIt
seems to be that what we lack is the will

The idea of the US or any other nation taking action ie military
intervention in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who 
advocate such action After the belligerants are subdued it would require
an occupation force for one or two generations If you will stop and
think about it you will realize that these people have never forgotten
a single slight or injury they have imbibed hatred with their mothers
milk If we stop the fighting seize and destroy all weapons they will
simply go back to killing each other with clubs And the price for this
futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to
die A price I am unwilling to even consider

Second point of difference which makes it different from the holocastsp  is that at that time international community
didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event

There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust All of the Jewish people
that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate To be wary of
others most certainly but not to hate And except for the Warsaw
uprising they were unarmed and even in Warsaw badly outgunned
It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone elses muscles
Suppose we do this thing what will you tell the parents wives children
lovers of those we are sending to die That they gave their lives in some noble cause Noble cause separating some mad dogs who will turn on them

Well I will offer you some muscle Suppose we tell them that they have
one week this will give foreign nationals time to leave to cease
their bloodshed At the end of that week bring in the Tomahawk firing
ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities Perhaps
when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden
attack of brains Send in missiles by all means but do not send in
troops

today inspite of all the mightthe international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which

By all means lift the embargo

is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bullyHence indirecltly and possibly
unintentionally mankind has sided with the killersAnd thisI think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world

Which killers Do you honestly believe they are all on one side
