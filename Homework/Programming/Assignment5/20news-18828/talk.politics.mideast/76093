Subject Re Clintons views on Jerusalem

bf3833pyuxeccbellcorecom feigenbaumbenjamin writes

I recently read that during Bill Clintons campaign he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israels capital  According to the article Mr Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency  However
during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of
State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties

Now I dont want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem  All I want to know is if anyone can 
authenticate Mr Clintons statements with dates places etc

From a recent interview in Middle East Insight magazine
Clinton said that he supports moving the US Embassy to
Jerusalem but would not do so at this time because it
would interrupt the peace talks
