First of all I have to reiterate that your terminology in describing
the events of 1974 are extremely misleading Cyprus is NOT occupied
by Turkish forces it was invited by Turkish Cypriots and intervened

  OhI seeI didnt realize this

  I think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic and your
  reasons for thinking the way you do You should then distribute them
  amongst the worlds population You see I dont think there are many
  people who are aware of this fact Thank you for telling us the truth

  BTW I would start by sending your flyers to each of the UN officials
	   Also after you have distributed your flyers you might consider
       hiding You see I think that once more people read what you think
       they will have to lock you up in a mental institute and dont think
       they will ever let you out
 
  It is a strange strange world you live in I feel sorry for you
