I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that
totally destroys Begins whitewash  I have no particular desire
to post it yet again

You apparently think you are some sort of oneman judge and jury who
can declare total victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause  But youve picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged quotations can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin massacre

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology
At the most basic level you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
quotations that support your preset opinions

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your quotations have an axe to grind and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you quote  For
example Meir Pail whom you cite was indeed a general a scholar
and a war hero  But that doesnt mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold  In fact and here your lack of experience
shows Pail is such a fanatic embittered leftist that much of his
antiIsrael blathering forget about antiIrgun blathering would be
considered something like treason in nonIsrael contexts  But of
course you dont consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
quotation that you can use to attack Israel

Benny Morris of Hashomer Hatzair represents himself as a scholar
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun  Dont be fooled
Its just the old Zionist ideological catfight surfacing as an
attack on the then Likud government  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence
you will see his indictment to be pure hot air  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence  Unfortunately for him because his book parades itself as
scholarly he is forced to put footnotes  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing

The Deir Yassin massacre never took place as the propagandists
tell it any more than the Sabra and Shatila massacres Do you get
the feeling people like to blame the Jews for massacres even if
they have to make them up  It must sound spicy  Even some Jews
like to do it for reasons of their own

Please dont confuse any of you Deir Yassin massacre stuff
with facts or scholarship  You should stick to Begins version
unless you find something serious to contradict it
