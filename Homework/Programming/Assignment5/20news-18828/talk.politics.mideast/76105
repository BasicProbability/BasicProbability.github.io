Subject Re Israeli Terrorism

If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a Hamas Mujahid with an antitank missile
then Im almost sure that the terrorist zionists would not have been able
to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile

maybe the missile didnt hit directly such that his body
gets desintegrated  of course destroying 10 houses to
kill someone is not a surgical operation or is it
