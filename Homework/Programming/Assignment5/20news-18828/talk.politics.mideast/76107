Ive heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they dont read about
itRemember the Treaty of Sevresas a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWIThe Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie GreeksArmeniansKurdsI must say TurkKurd relations are 
improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to Turkeys neighbours
The Turks blatantly rejected this treatythe Germans grudgingly accepted 
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
German peopleThe Greeks who had an army therewere there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after 
the Greek forces were were destroyed at SmyrnaWhen this occurred incidently
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the 
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed theyre way up the sides of the ships

It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading I think
that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres First thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the 
Republic of Turkey The new independence movement which by the way is not the same as the Young Turks naturally rejected it out of hand to say that we 
should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler Second the Sevres treaty was even 
worse than Versailles It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence 
zones had the capital occupied the economy under Allied control the army di
minished to nothing but a police force in short a country in name only Id
wonder if you would like to live under such conditions And for the record I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour Before evacuating the 
city the Greek forces burned it down so it serves them right
As for being fooled by Allied promises that too is your fault You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well
