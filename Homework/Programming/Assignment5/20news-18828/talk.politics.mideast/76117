Subject ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES

Dear friends

I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee As part of
the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a
questionnaire to colect data for my research project The study intends to
determine which techniques if any have been used to teach music for the deaf

If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to
help me with this project your help would be very much appreciated 

If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter feel yourself
welcome I have been working in this area for a while in Brazil  by the way
I am Brazilian  and also in US and I am very pleased with the results

I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences Thank you for
or time and consideration
