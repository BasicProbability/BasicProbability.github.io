Subject Re ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES Henrik




The student of regional killings alias Davidian not the Davidian religios sect writes


Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh to the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean so if you use the term Greater Armenia use it with care


	Finally you said what you dream about Mediterranean That was new
	The area will be greater after some years like your holocaust numbers




It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh 
by removing the Armenians When the president of Azerbaijan Elchibey came to 
power last year he announced he would be be swimming in Lake Sevan in 
Armeniaxn by July
		
	Ist July in USA now Here in Sweden its April and still cold
	Or have you changed your calendar


Well he was wrong If Elchibey is going to shell the 
Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam his people will pay the price If Elchibey 
						    
is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price If 
						    
Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of 
Kelbajar his people will pay the price 
			    


	NOTHING OF THE MENTIONED IS TRUE BUT LET SAY ITs TRUE
	
	SHALL THE AZERI WOMEN AND CHILDREN GOING TO PAY THE PRICE WITH
						    
	BEING RAPED KILLED AND TORTURED BY THE ARMENIANS
	
	HAVE YOU HEARDED SOMETHING CALLED GENEVA CONVENTION
	YOU FACIST



	Ohhh i forgot this is how Armenians fight nobody has forgot
	you killings rapings and torture against the Kurds and Turks once
	upon a time
      
       

And anyway this 60 
Kurd refugee story as have other stories are simple fabrications sourced in 
Baku modified in Ankara Other examples of this are Armenia has no border 
with Iran and the ridiculous story of the intercepting of Armenian military 
conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by 
somebody unknown from Armenian into Azeri Turkish submitted by an unnamed 
special correspondent to the NY Times from Baku Real accurate

Ohhhh so swedish RedCross workers do lie they too What ever you say
regional killer if you dont like the person then shoot him thats your policyl


HE	Search Turkish planes You dont know what you are talking about
HE	since its content is announced to be weapons 				i	 
										i
Well big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan	i
from Turkey yet Demirel and others say no No wonder you are so confused	i
										i
										i
	Confused								i
	You facist when you delete text dont change it i wrote		i
										i
        Search Turkish planes You dont know what you are talking about	i
        Turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons  i
        to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan		
        it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons	
        since its content is announced to be weapons   

	If there is one thats confused then thats you We have the right and we do
	to give weapons to the Azeris since Armenians started the fight in Azerbadjan
 

You are correct all Turkish planes should be simply shot down Nice slow
moving air transports

	Shoot down with what Armenian bread and butter Or the arms and personel 
	of the Russian army
