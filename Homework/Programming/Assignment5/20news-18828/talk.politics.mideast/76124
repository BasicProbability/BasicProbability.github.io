DEPOSITION OF YURI VAGARSHAKOVICH MUSAELIAN

   Born 1953
   Line Electrician
   Sumgait Streetcar and Trolleybus Administration

   Resident at Building 421 Apartment 29
   Block 14 Narimanov Street
   Sumgait Azerbaijan


I spent almost all of February doing overhaul The 27th was a short day at
work we worked until eleven or eleventhirty and left for home I decided
to go for a short walk I went to Primorsky Park I walked past the Eternal
Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there When I had
walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes
behind me I turned my head toward the sound It was a light blue GAZ24
Volga I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the 
car A man and a woman get out The man is expensively dressed in a suit
and the woman has a raincoat on She doesnt have anything on her head and 
her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavyset woman Theyre 40 to 
45 years old They get something out of the trunk The people start to help
them I become curious just what are they pulling out of there

When I got up close I heard them turn something on I didnt see what it was 
but it was probably a tape recorder They put it on the ground near the 
Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle
around it I ask Whats going on Someone tells me Come listen Well
they were Azerbaijanis I had asked in Azerbaijani I hear appeals Brother
Muslims our time has come     and something else along that line I
didnt understand what it was all about I walked around the group trying to 
get a look at the owner of the tape recorder But the circle drew in tighter 
New people started coming from various directions five here seven there And
the comments started Right we should slaughter the Armenians and Theres
no need to be afraid all of Moscow is behind us I even heard that All 
Moscow is behind us Well I watched and listened in and realized that this 
was no joke I quietly left and went home

Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh 
that there were demonstrations there Well people were saying all kinds of 
things but I didnt have any idea what was really going on

My wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunts house in Baku 
I didnt say anything to my wife We sat and drank tea Sometime around two
oclock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and 
shouting I looked out the window and saw a crowd The crowd is moving slowly
like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a 
demonstration and move slowly

My wife asks whats going on out there I say I dont know I put on some
outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about In the crowd
people are shouting Down with the Armenians and Death to the Armenians I
waited for the entire crowd to pass At first they went down Narimanov Street 
on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee then they turned 
and went against the trafficits one way theredown the Street of the 26 
Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line I went home and told my wife there 
was a demonstration going on In fact I thought that we were having the same 
kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh Aside 
from the things they were shouting I was surprised that there were only young
people in the crowd And they were minors under draft age

My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but I was kind of
uneasy and said No lets stay at home instead An hour went by or maybe 
an hour and a half Well I wasnt keeping track of the time I cant say
exactly how long it was I look and see another crowd on Narimanov but now on
the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the Rossiya movie theater

I put outside clothes on and went out again Theres noise an uproar outside
and the crowd has grown There are more people And whereas the first time 
there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more 
aggressive No I think somethings wrong here this isnt any demonstration
They would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run 
again I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street I 
followed them I was thinking Id just watch and see Who knew where this was 
leading We came out on Lenin Square At the square the SK club is on one 
side and the City Party Committee is on the other I went toward the square 
and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out There 
was some sort of a rally going on I go closer and hear exclamations appeals
I heard both antiArmenian and antiSoviet appeals We dont need 
perestroika we want to go on living like we have been Now what did they 
mean by living like we have been The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else 
But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense 
of others Speculation theft and cheating go on all the time And not just 
in Azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but Ive never seen it 
anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan

Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians 
apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out True I didnt 
hear them say kill them over the microphone I only heard beat them and 
drive them out I stayed at the square a few minutes longer First one then
another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd Off
to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and 
I think they were MVD Ministry of Internal Affairs or State Security KGB
There were also uniformed policemen there but I didnt see any of them try 
to pacify the crowd New people kept coming up onto the stage

Well I had finally decided that this could end badly This was no
demonstration and I had to protect my family

I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck It was next
to the City Party Committee on Narimanov Street it stood next to the tai
lors shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels I see that some
thing is being unloaded crates of some sort I decided to go look because
after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons
in there They pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the City 
Party Committee but toward the SK club And when I went right up to them I 
saw that they were cases of vodka There were two people handing down the 
cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people 15 
to 20 They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried 
off by two people Two people one case of vodka And there was a man standing
right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe 
about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller It was anasha 
When I passed next to that person he stood with his side to me There was 
about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him He 
has a package in his hand and hes pulling out anasha and handing it out I 
have never smoked it myself Once I tried it for fun but Ive seen a lot of 
people smoke it Ive seen it many times and I know what it is I strolled 
around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there

Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling more warlike shouting 
I turned around and saw them running Well Ill just keep on going like I am 
I thought When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags 
And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the 
street Hes a young guy 21 or 22 years old He was carrying a red flag 
which had Ermeni oryum written on it in Azerbaijani that means Death to 
Armenians That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us I dont really
know what his name is but I know his father very well His fathers name is
Rafik he used to be a cook and then became head chef He used to have a dark
blue Zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06 His 
family as I said lived on the same courtyard as we did Our building was on 
Narimanov Street and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars 
their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the 
left Now Rafiks little brother lives there and he Rafik I heard got a 
new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict In a word his son 
was carrying a flag that said Death to Armenians I was surprised because 
before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being 
done not by people from Sumgait but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan

Well anyway I went home My wife was upset I told her Its OK itll pass 
theyre young kids theyve just gotten all whooped up Naturally I didnt 
want her to get overly upset After a while a new surge of crowd went by And 
this time they were breaking glass I could hear it breaking but I couldnt 
see where Well I think here we go the machines in motion They werent 
handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing I didnt see people drinking 
and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadnt unloaded the vodka and 
hashish to put in a store window

So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one 
would stop them now they werent even trying although Ill say it again 
the police were there I saw them And its not just that the police werent 
breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time 
True at the time I couldnt even imagine that under our government our much
vaunted leadershipand Im not afraid to say these words so many people 
died So many women were abused and how many abominations there wereI 
couldnt imagine that under our muchvaunted authorities and if I were to be 
specific I would say under the muchtouted authorities in our city of 
Sumgait I couldnt imagine that such things could take place

When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son Lets go upstairs 
We went to our neighbors the Grigorians on the fourth floor And in the 
evening when those crowds started going past again I went outside once more
I stopped at The Corner a place called that right next to the bazaar I 
look and see a crowd on the run And there a few yards from the entrance to 
the bazaar are three respectablelooking men of around say 50 years old 
The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed 
toward the bazaar And then the whole crowd as though it were one person 
wheeled and raced toward the bazaar And not a soul went past those three as 
though it were off limits Well everything got all churned up there was more 
noise and the glass was flying again

We spent the night at the neighbors My apartment was on the first floor
there was really no way to defend yourself there

In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town 
On the way I saw someone hunched up still I never found out who it was or 
what happened to him There were 10 to 15 people standing near him I got the 
bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying 
there hunched up sort of enclosing him because of the way they were standing
you couldnt even see him

That was on the morning of February 28 Everyone knows the rest
