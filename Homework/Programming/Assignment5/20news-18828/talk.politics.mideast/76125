Subject US WANTS IRAN TO END TERRORISM LINKS 

	WASHINGTON UPI  A senior State Department official on Tuesday
ruled out any softening of US attitudes toward Iraq but said relations
with Irans Islamic regime could improve substantially if that
government disassociates itself from international terrorism
	Despite the namecalling and the harsh rhetoric from across the
Gulf despite all this we do not take a position of permanent hostility
towards the Islamic Republic of Iran David Mack deputy assistant
secretary for Near Eastern Affairs said
	The primary US objection is Irans international behaviour
which includes extending support of violence to disrupt the Arab
Israeli peace process and its rapid buildup of dangerous weapons
	Mack said Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but
first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area
	Mack spoke at the USGCC business conference aimed at promoting
GulfAmerican trade He said the Middle East will be an item very high
on the agenda of the US administration
	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren
Christopers visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere
else in the world Mack said He added that the US has no longterm
plan to station troops in the Gulf
	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to
pressure Iraq to comply with all the UN Security resolutions
	As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect
compliance Mack told delegates
