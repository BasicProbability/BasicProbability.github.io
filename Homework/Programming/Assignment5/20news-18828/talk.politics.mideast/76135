  In ReSyrias Expansion the author writes that the UN thought
  Zionism was Racism and that they were wrong  They were correct
  the first time Zionism is Racism and thankfully the McGill Daily
  the student newspaper at McGill was proud enough to print an article
  saying so  If you want a copy send me mail
  
 Was the article about zionism or about something else The majority
 of people I heard emitting this ignorant statement do not really
 know what zionism is They have just associated it with what they think
 they know about the political situation in the middle east 
 
 So Steve Lets here what IS zionism

  Assuming that you mean hear you werent listening he just
  told you Zionism is Racism  This is a tautological statement
