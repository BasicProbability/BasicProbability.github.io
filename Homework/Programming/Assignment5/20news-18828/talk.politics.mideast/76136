OY If you are really interested I can provide you with a number of references
OY on the issue  Just send me EMail for that  

	You think I am that STUPID to ask you for REFERENCES   NOT 
	I have many GREEK friends that I could ask for the INFO if I
	needed I have already read many articles and DO NOT need
	your help Boy how generous 


There is a very narrow margin of stupidity between accepting my references and
those of the Greeks and you just said youd rather do the latter Thats fine
with me I was sincere in my offer but this saves me the effort It doesnt
take a halfbrained man to go to any library and check out a bunch of sources
of decent objectivity Just ask a good friend for help 


Stay on these roads
