PS My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics It has to do with
the search for peace which would enable justice I dont consider that
justice is done when nonJews who fled or were expelled in 19481967
are not permitted to return to their homeland 

How about Jews who were expelled from their homelands in Iraq Syria
Jordan Algeria etc  Dont they deserve justice too

This can at best be called
pragmatism a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong It can
never be called justice 

Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel but never
against the Arab states even when they are so much more guilty of the
accusations you make  Is it because you now call yourself a
Palestinean 

And peace without justice will never be peace

This is why the landforpeace formula is so foolish  Landforland
or peaceforpeace seems much more just except that it would cost the
Arabs something and so is not under consideration  

Lets not forget that about half of Israels population are refugees
from Arab countries  Somehow THEIR land now being occupied by Arab
states and THEIR homes now being livedin by Arab people are not
included in any negotiations  Is this your prescription for peace 

It is my conviction that the situation in which a state through the
law attempts to discourage mixed marriages as Israel does is not
normal Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than
Western democracies such as the United States in which Jews are free to
marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands 

Again youve somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab
states are much more restrictive on these points  In fact the
officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes
them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely

American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed
Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW

There are many states in which Christians can live happily many which
have official religions and Christian majorities and Christianbased
laws  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states  There is only
1 one Jewish state  Do you have a problem with this  Is this one
Jewish state too many  There are others who might agree with you you
know 

I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views
and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional infantile
outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect
Judaism are uncivilized Such behaviour is not good for Judaism

Have you just arrived on tpm recently  Again the supporters of the
Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of
emotional infantile outbursts which have weakened their positions
dramatically  Somehow your criticisms are very onesided and
simpleminded 

PS Hows the Fund coming along
