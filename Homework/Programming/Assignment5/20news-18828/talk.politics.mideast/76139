Subject Re THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY SOLD 400 TONES OF ARMENIAN BONES IN 1924

On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging Turkish protofascist state In their names we demand justice

In April 1915 the Turkish government began a systematically executed 
depopulation of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a 
genocidal extermination This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey The 
result 15 million murdered 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered This genocide ended nearly 3000 years of Armenian civilization
on those lands Today the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands Todays Turkish
governmental policy is to rewrite the history of the era to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people In 
the face of refutation ad nauseam the Turkish Historical Society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred This policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains unredressed and unpunished A crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the 
successful genocide of the Armenians
