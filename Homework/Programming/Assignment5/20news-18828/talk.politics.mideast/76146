Well im not sure about the story nad it did seem biased What
I disagree with is your statement that the US Media is out to
ruin Israels reputation That is rediculous The US media is
the most proisraeli media in the world Having lived in Europe
I realize that incidences such as the one described in the
letter have occured The US media as a whole seem to try to
ignore them The US is subsidizing Israels existance and the
Europeans are not at least not to the same degree So I think
that might be a reason they report more clearly on the
atrocities
	What is a shame is that in Austria daily reports of
the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing
received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt
go away After all look how the Jews are treating other races
when they got power It is unfortunate

Well said Mr Beyer
