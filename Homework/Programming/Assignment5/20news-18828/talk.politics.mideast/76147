  BTW with Bosnias large Moslem population why have nations like 
  Turkey Saudi Arabia Syria Egypt and others with either money 
  or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered 
  to help out Bosnia   

Obviously you really dont know

They have spoken out cf Secy of State Christophers recent trip to the ME
they have provided millions in aid and they have participated in the airlifts
to Sarajevo  They would supply military aid if the UN would lift the embargo 
on arms sales 

  The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said
  a thing or two but thats all I see no great enthusism from any 
  of those places to get their hands dirty    Why does the US always
  get stuck with this stuff


See above  Kuwait has directly participated in the airlift of food to
Sarajevo

  Besides theres no case that can be made for US military involvement
  there that doesnt apply equally well to say Liberia Angola or
  it appears with the Khmer Rouges new campaign Cambodia   Nonwhites
  dont count

Hmmsome might say Kuwaitis are nonwhite Ooops I forgot Kuwaitis are
oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they dont count
