Subject Final Solution for Gaza 

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto

fete Since this word both formally and commonly refers to
positivejoyous events your misuse of it here is rather unsettling
 
they repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto 
and attempt to starve the Gazans

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are
abusive towards the PalestiniansGazans Given that however there 
is no comparison between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza  

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice 

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure 
Ironically international law recognizes each of these focusses
that of the occupied and the occupier even though they are 
inherently in conflict

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
selfdetermination it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings

Israel certainly cannot and should not continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents There is however a third 
alternative the creation and implementation of a jewish dhimmi
system with GazansPalestinians as benignly protected citizens
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islams policies towards its minorities
 
Whether they have some Final Solution up their sleeve 

It is a race then Between Israels antiPalestinianGazan
Final Solution and the Arab Worlds antiIsraeljewish
Final Solution Do you favor one neither 

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human civil and
political rights to which they are entitled as human beings

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel
and ArabPalestinian final solution intentions exist isnt it
important that BOTH Israeli and PalestinianGazan rights
be secured
