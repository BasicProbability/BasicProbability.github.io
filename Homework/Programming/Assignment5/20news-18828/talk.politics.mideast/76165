 Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely onesided and
 selectively naive

Oooh now THAT hurts  I will not suffer you through more naive
and onesided views of mine   Please skip my articles in the future
Oh Wise Tim and have a good day

What is the point in throwing out onesided viewpoints which means
ignoring that the other sides perspective and experience HAS ANY 
LEGITIMACY while assuming that your side possesses no faults and 
bears no responbility for ANY of the negative impacts of a particular 
event Isnt the former onesided Isnt the latter naive If you feel 
that my opinion is wrong then please tell me how Strategic withdrawal 
under the cover of a snide remark seems to be the favored tactic on this
net but doesnt accomplish anything
