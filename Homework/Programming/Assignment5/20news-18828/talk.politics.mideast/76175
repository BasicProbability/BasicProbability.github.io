Subject Re Israels Expansion II


   The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust
is insulting and completely false  Any person making such a rude
and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust or also
ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an antisemite

   To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
of 6000000 Jews is racist in and of itself
