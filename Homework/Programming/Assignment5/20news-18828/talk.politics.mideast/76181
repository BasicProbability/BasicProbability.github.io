   How many of you readers know anything about Jews living in the
Arab countries  How many of you know if Jews still live in these
countries  How many of you know what the circumstances of Arabic
Jews leaving their homelands were  Just curious




I thought there are no jews live in Arab countries didnt hey move
all to Palestine  Only the happy jews did not move

Would you tell me which Arab country is prohipiting the Jews from
migrating to Palestine

the last arab country was syria but not all of them
migrated due to the jewish state economical and 
securital dilemma
