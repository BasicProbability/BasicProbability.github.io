The following flyer was distributed at AIPACs 34th annual Policy Conference

Because when were not in Israel were told to go back where we came from and
when we come back to Israel were told to go back to where we came from and 
when were vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford
to be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can
afford to because Jews are so rich and when we dont buy something its because
were cheap and because when we are poor were called dirty Jew and ignorant
and when were not were called called rich Jew and JAP and when we are visibly
organized its because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and when were not it
is because there is a secret Jewish conspiracy and because were told were not
a people and when we say we are were still told that were not and when we
marry our own people were called racist and we dont were contaminating 
someone elses race and because were under fire from the Left and from the 
Right and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because
there are nonwhites who hate us for being white  and because antisemitic 
incidents are rising every year but were told that antisemitism doesnt 
exist or that were paranoid and because were told to shut up about the 
Holocaust and yet Holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are
obnoxious were called JAPs and when we are nice were told we dont act
Jewish and because antisemitism is now worldwide and because our people is
not yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are
we free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of
the Jewish National Liberation Movement ZIONISM
