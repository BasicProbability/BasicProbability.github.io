I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
reported accurately on what was happening in Germany It is
interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda

If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda then 
consider the Washington Posts handling of American events to be propoganda
too  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion  I
wouldnt compare it to Nazi propoganda either  Unless you want to provide
some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism I suggest you 
keep your mouth shut  Im sick and tired of all you antisemites comparing
Israel to the Nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare Israel to the Nazis
you are an antisemite because you know damn well it isnt true and you are
just trying to discredit Israel
