Subject Re Israeli Terrorism

In article 1993Apr242036206531VirginiaEDU ab4zVirginiaEDU Andi Beyer writes
I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
reported accurately on what was happening in Germany It is
interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda

Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or 
Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn 
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another The only way 
to determine that is to try and get beyond the writers political
agenda whether it is on or against our side
