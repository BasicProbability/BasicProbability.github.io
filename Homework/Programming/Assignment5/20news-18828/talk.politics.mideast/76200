article  I have no partisan interests  I would just like to know
what conversations between TerPetrosyan and Demirel sound like  

Very simple

XSoviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
 against 25 million Muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
 reparations to the Turks and Kurds

After all your criminal grandparents exterminated 25 million Muslim
people between 1914 and 1920

To which I say
Hear hear  Motion seconded

You must be a new Arromdian You are counting on ASALASDPAARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you No wonder you are in 
such a mess That criminal idiot and its forgednonexistent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu Cosar Akgun Uludamar Akman Oflazer 
and hundreds of people Moreover ASALASDPAARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people This racist barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist xSoviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide 

Now where shall I begin

AP I am asking you to show me one example in which mutlucoras or any other
AP Turk was proven to lieI can show tens of lies and fabrications of
AP Davidian like changing quote  even changing name of a book Anna

The obvious ridiculous Armenians murdered 3 million Moslems is the most
outragious and unsubstantiated charge of all You are obviously new on this 
net so read the following sample  not one but three proven lies in one
day

In article 1990Aug51421595773cbnewsdattcom the usenet scribe for the 
Turkish Historical Society hbmcbnewsdattcom hasanbmutlu continues to
revise the history of the Armenian people Lets witness the operational
definition of a revisionist yalanci or liar in Turkish

Yalanci According to Leo1
Yalanci
Yalanci The situation is clear On one side we have peaceloving Turks
Yalanci and on the other side peaceloving Armenians both sides minding
Yalanci their own affairs Then all was submerged in blood and fire Indeed
Yalanci the war was actually being waged between the Committee of 
Yalanci Dashnaktsutiun and the Society of Ittihad and Terakki  a cruel and 
Yalanci savage war in defense of party political interests The Dashnaks 
Yalanci incited revolts which relied on Russian bayonets for their success
Yalanci 
Yalanci 1 L Kuper Genocide Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century
Yalanci     New York 1981 p 157

This text is available not only in most bookstores but in many libraries On
page 157 we find a discussion of related atrocities which is title of the
chapter The topic on this page concerns itself with submissions to the Sub
Commission on Prevention of Discrimination of Minorities of the Commission on
Human Rights of the United Nations with respect to the massacres in Cambodia
There is no mention of Turks nor Armenians as claimed above

				  

Vay sarsak vay yobaz vay yalanci Vay Turk milletinin yuz karasi Mutlu vay

The depth of foolishness the Turkish Historical Society engages in while
covering up the Turkish genocide of the Armenians is only surpassed by the 
ridiculous historical material publicly displayed

David Davidian dbdurartuSDPAorg   The life of a people is a sea and  

Receiving this message I checked the reference LKuperGenocide and
what I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian saidThe book
was like voice of Armenian revolutionists and although I read the whole book
I could not find the original quota
But there was one more thing to checkThe original posting of MutluI found 
the original article of MutluIt is as follows

 According to Leo1

The situation is clear On one side we have peaceloving Turks and on
 the other side peaceloving Armenians both sides minding their own 
 affairs Then all was submerged in blood and fire Indeed the war was
 actually being waged between the Committee of Dashnaktsutiun and the
 Society of Ittihad and Terakki  a cruel and savage war in defense of party
 political interests The Dashnaks incited revolts which relied on Russian
 bayonets for their success

    p 157
    

QUATO IS THE SAME REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT 

DAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU
JUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR

Davidian thank you for writing the page number correctly

You are the biggest liar I have ever seenThis example showed me that tomorrow
you can lie again and you may try to make me a liar this timeSo I decided
not to read your articles and not to write answers to youI also advise
all the netters to do the sameWe can not prevent your lies but at least
we may save time by not dealing with your lies

And for the following line
Vay sarsak vay yobaz vay yalanci Vay Turk milletinin yuz karasi Mutlu vay

I also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you
I hope you will be drowned in your lies

 Source Adventures in the Near East 19181922 by A Rawlinson
 Jonathan Cape 30 Bedford Square London 1934 First published 1923 
 287 pages

DD Such a pile of garbage First off the above reference was first published
DD in 1924 NOT 1923 and has 353 pages NOT 287 Second upon checking page 
DD 178 we are asked to believe
 
VD No MrDavidian  
 
VD  It was first published IN 1923 I have the book on my desknow 
VD                         
 
VD  and furthermorethe book I have does not have 353 pages either as you
VD  claimed MrDavidianIt has 377 pagesAny question
  
Well it seems YOUR book has its total page numbers closer to mine than the 
ncrap posted by Mr 
 
 o boy   
 
 Please can you tell us why those quotes are crapbecause you do not 
 like thembecause they really existwhy
 
 As I said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic  
  
 You couldnt reject it
 

In addition the Authors Preface was written on January 15 1923 BUT THE BOOK
was published in 1924
 
 Here we go again
 In the book I have both the front page and the Authors preface give 
 the same year 1923 and 15 January 1923 respectively
 Anyone can check it at herhis libraryif not I can send you the copies of
 pages please ask by sct 
 
 
I really dont care what year it was first published1923 or 1924
What I care about is what the book writes about murders torturesetin
the given quotes by Serdar Argic and your denial of these quotesand your
groundless accussations etc 
 


 
DD I can provide gif postings if required to verify my claim
 
VD what is new
 
I will post a gif file but I am not going go through the effort to show there 
is some Turkish modified republication of the book like last time
 
 
 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923first publication
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934Serdar Argics Reference hasYou couldnt reject itbut now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around
 
 Lets see how you liefrom nonexisting quotes to republication
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given referenceYou
 called Serdar Argic a liar
 I said to you NO MRDavidian there exactly existed such a quote
 I even gave the call number page numbersyou couldt reject it
 
 And now you are lying again and talking about modifiedrepublished book
without any proof how when where by whom etc
 by the way how is it possible to republish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924your claimI am sure that you have some pretty 
  well suited theories as usual
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and MrDavidians liesI also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use which are  
                 9496 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes218 and 215
              
     
 
 
It is not possible that s text has 287 pages mine has 353 and yours has
377
 
 Now are you claiming that there cant be such a reference by saying it is
 not possible If not what is your point
 
 Differences in the number of pages
 Mine was published in 1923Serdar Argics was in 1934
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publicationsetc etc does it give you an idea
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book hasor the year
 first published 
 And you tried to hide the whole point
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed torturedetc by Armeniansand those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist 
 It was the issue wasntit  
 
 you were not able to object itDoes it bother you anyway 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders by Armenians as a crap
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many craps in the 1993 
 
 Any question

   Hmm  Turks sure know how to keep track of deaths but they seem to
lose count around 15 million

Well apparently we have another son of Dro the Butcher to contend with 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a fact

I will dissect articlebyarticle paragraphbyparagraph linebyline 
liebylie revisionbyrevision written by those on this net who plan 
to prove that the Armenian genocide of 25 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic unredressed genocide We are neither in 
xSoviet Union nor in some similar ultranationalist fascist dictatorship 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest Also feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALASDPAARF terrorists
the Armenian pseudoscholars or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 25 million Turkish men
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide You and 
those like you will not get away with the genocides coverup

Not a chance
