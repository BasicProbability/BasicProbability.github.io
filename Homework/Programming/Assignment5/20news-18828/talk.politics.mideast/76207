Congratulations to the brave men of the Lebanese resistance With every
Israeli son that you place in the grave you are underlining the moral
bankruptcy of Israels occupation and drawing attention to the Israeli
governments policy of reckless disregard for civilian life


	Apparently the Hizbollah were encouraged by Brads cheers
	good job Brad Someone forgot to tell them though that 
	Brad asks them to place only Israeli sons in the grave 
	not daughters Paraphrasing a bit with every rocket that 
	the Hizbollah fires on the Galilee they justify Israels 
	holding to the security zone
