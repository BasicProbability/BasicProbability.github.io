I understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it
is its right to annex it I cant fully understand why it has
to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated
before the holocaust the Final Solution by Hitler What I
totally dont get is why the US has to subsidize the
existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights
				Just wondering

Seems that youre more just misinformed than just wondering

The comparison youre making is not just totally off base but
offensive to all sane people
