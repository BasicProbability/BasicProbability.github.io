   THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE

                         by Theodore J OKeefe

HARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT within clear view of the Jefferson
Memorial an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial
has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of
America a costly and dangerous mistake  On ground where no monument yet
marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all
races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation sits today a
massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false
version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II of nonAmerican
members of a minority sectarian group  Now in the deceptive guise of
tolerance the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda
campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer
in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America

After reading the first paragraph a quick scan confirmed my first
impression this is a bunch of revisionist and antisemitic hogwash

The NY Times reported on April 18 1993 that the museum was built
through private contributions on Federal land  Your hatemongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact intellectual content
and social value  Down the toilet it goes
