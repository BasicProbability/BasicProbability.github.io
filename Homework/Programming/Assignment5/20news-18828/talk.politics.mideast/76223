    The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust
 is insulting and completely false  Any person making such a rude
 and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust or also
 ignorant of the situation in the mideast or is an antisemite
 
    To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
 of 6000000 Jews is racist in and of itself
 
First of all I never said the Holocaust I said before the
Holocaust Im not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more
about Nazi Germany than most people maybe including you 
	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people
names when they disagree with your position Opposing the
atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies
as antisemitism If you think name calling is a valid form of
argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more
often
	I dont think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
not appreciated
