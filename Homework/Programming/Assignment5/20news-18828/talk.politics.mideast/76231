Are you aware that there is an arms embargo on all of what iswas
Yugoslavia including Bosnia which guarantees massive military
superiority of Serbian forces and does not allow the Bosnians to
try to defend themselves 
Should we sell weapons to all sides or just the losing one then
 
Ending an embargo does not we must sell anything at all

Right  Well probably end up giving them weapons

If the Europeans want to sell weapons to one or both sides they are welcome
as far as Im concerned
 
You seem to oppose ending the embargo  You know it is difficult for Europeans
to sell weapons when there is an embargo in place

During WWII the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite
German occupation  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides
sponsoring peace conferences they would have no problem putting any kind of
weapon they wanted into Bosnia

I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law
forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia including via third
parties  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active
role would be too great  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in
the outcome of the war

I do not automatically accept the argument that Bosnia is any worse than
other recent civil wars say Vietnam for instance  The difference is it is
happening to white people inside Europe with lots of TV coverage
 
But if this was the reason and if furthermore both sides are equal wouldnt
all us racist Americans be favoring the good Christians Serbs instead
of the nonChristians we really seem to favor

Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press  And thats
about all we have to go on isnt it  

And I wish youd quit hurling words like racist around  There are many levels
at which people react to what they see  At the most fundamental level you
do not have to consciously recognize the racial element  you simply tend to
empathize more with people who are like yourself  As far preferring
Christian over Moslem I am an atheist myself and I think youll agree that
in the US the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of
religion nor give it a particularly important place in their world view
