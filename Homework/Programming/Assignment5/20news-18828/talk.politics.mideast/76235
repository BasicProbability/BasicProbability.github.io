DG THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM A COSTLY AND DANGEROUS MISTAKE
DG by Theodore J OKeefe
DG HARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT within clear view of the Jefferson
DG Memorial an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial
DG has arisen on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of
DG America a costly and dangerous mistake  On ground where no monument yet
DG marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all
DG races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation sits today a
DG massive and costly edifice devoted above all to a contentious and false
DG version of the ordeal in Europe during World War II of nonAmerican
DG members of a minority sectarian group  Now in the deceptive guise of
DG tolerance the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda
DG campaign financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer
DG in the interests of Israel and its adherents in America

JAKE After reading the first paragraph a quick scan confirmed my first
JAKE impression this is a bunch of revisionist and antisemitic hogwash

Jake Im really disappointed in you It took you a whole paragraph
to see that it was bunch of revisionist and antisemitic hogwash 

The article title THE US HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL MUSEUM A COSTLY AND 
DANGEROUS MISTAKE should have been enough
