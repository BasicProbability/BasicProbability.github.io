   Im surprised that you dont consider the acquisition of land by
   the Jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive
   state as a hostile action leading to war

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state not an
 exclusive state  If the state was to be exclusive it would not have
 400 000 arab citizens

Could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of 
Israel right after it was formed 


 	And no I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
 action  When someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing
 to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce  It
 is not a hostile action leading to war

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity
Palestinians are no exception Perhaps you heard about
antitrust in the business world

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions Basic ANTITRUST law says
that while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori  Clearly
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality Being a multiethnic 
multireligious society accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different just another religion Plus they paid fair
market value etc They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy Im not a conspiracy theorist
myself but this one is hard to dismiss


Right now Im just going to address this point
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land
It didnt buy it from the Palestinians themselves because
for the most part they were tenant farmers fallahin
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon
The JNF offered a premium deal so the owners took advantage of
it   Its called commerce  The owners however made no 
provisions for those who had worked for them basically shafting 
them by selling the land right out from under them
They are to blame not the Jews
