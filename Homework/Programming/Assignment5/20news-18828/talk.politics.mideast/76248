 First of all I never said the Holocaust I said before the
 Holocaust Im not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more
 about Nazi Germany than most people maybe including you 

Uh Oh  The first sign of an argument without meritthe stating of ones 
qualifications in an area  If you know something about Nazi Germany 
show it  If you dont shut up  Simple as that

 	I dont think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
 justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
 attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
 not appreciated

ALL Jews suffered during WWII not just our beloved who perished or were 
tortured  We ALL suffered  Second the namecalling was directed against
YOU not civillibertarians in general  Your namedropping of a fancy
sounding political term is yet another attempt to cite qualifications 
in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument  Go 
back to the minors junior
