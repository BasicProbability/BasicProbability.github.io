  BTW with Bosnias large Moslem population why have nations like 
  Turkey Saudi Arabia Syria Egypt and others with either money 
  or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered 
  to help out Bosnia   

Obviously you really dont know

They have spoken out cf Secy of State Christophers recent trip to the ME

  Note the clause more forcibly above     My point is that they have
  made a few proforma perfunctory remarks and sent in a few C130s and
  so forth but its clearly not something theyre losing much sleep over
  Theyre just going through the motions while Moslems are being ethnically
  cleansed out of what used to be Yugoslavia   The US has been speaking
  out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world
  forums


  Besides theres no case that can be made for US military involvement
  there that doesnt apply equally well to say Liberia Angola or
  it appears with the Khmer Rouges new campaign Cambodia   Nonwhites
  dont count

Hmmsome might say Kuwaitis are nonwhite Ooops I forgot Kuwaitis are
oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they dont count

  Precisely   Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification
  for US involvement in the Gulf  oil and geopolitics were  If the 
  the Kuwaitis didnt have oil and assuming Iraq still saw fit to 
  invade them I doubt you would have seen Operation Desert Storm
