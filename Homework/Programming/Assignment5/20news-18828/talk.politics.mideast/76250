	I dont know where you guys are from but in America
such attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are
not appreciated Here we let everyone speak their mind
regardless of how we feel about it Take your fascistic
repressive ideals back to where you came from


Hey tough guy freedom necessitates responsibility and
no freedom is absolute  
BTW to anyone who defends Arafat read on

Open fire on the new Jewish immigrants be they from the Soviet
Union Ethiopia or anywhere elseI give you my instructions to
use violence against the immigrants  I willjail anyone who
refuses to do this
				Yassir Arafat AlMuharar 41090
