    Besides theres no case that can be made for US military involvement
    there that doesnt apply equally well to say Liberia Angola or
    it appears with the Khmer Rouges new campaign Cambodia   Nonwhites
    dont count

  Hmmsome might say Kuwaitis are nonwhite Ooops I forgot Kuwaitis are
  oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they dont count

and lets not forget Somalia which is about as far from white as it
gets

  And why are we in Somalia   When right across the Gulf of Aden are
  some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet  Why does the 
  US always become the point man for this stuff   I dont mind us
  helping out but what invariably happens is that everybody expects
  us to do most of the work and take most of the risks even when these
  events are occuring in other peoples back yards and they have the
  resources to deal with them quite well thank you  I mean its 
  not like either Serbia or Somalia represent some overwhelming
  military force that their neighbors cant handle  Nor are the 
  logistics a big deal  its a lot bigger logistical challenge 
  to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia than from 
  Saudi Arabia harder to go from Texas to Serbia than Turkey or 
  Austria to Serbia
