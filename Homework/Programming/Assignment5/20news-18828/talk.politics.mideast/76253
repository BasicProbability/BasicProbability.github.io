  First of all I never said the Holocaust I said before the
  Holocaust Im not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more
  about Nazi Germany than most people maybe including you 
 
 Uh Oh  The first sign of an argument without meritthe stating of ones 
 qualifications in an area  If you know something about Nazi Germany 
 show it  If you dont shut up  Simple as that
 
  	I dont think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
  justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
  attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
  not appreciated
 
 ALL Jews suffered during WWII not just our beloved who perished or were 
 tortured  We ALL suffered  Second the namecalling was directed against
 YOU not civillibertarians in general  Your namedropping of a fancy
 sounding political term is yet another attempt to cite qualifications 
 in order to obfuscate your glaring unpreparedness for this argument  Go 
 back to the minors junior
	All humans suffered emotionally some Jews and many
others suffered physically It is sad that people like you are
so blinded by emotions that they cant see the facts Thanks
for calling me names it only assures me of what kind of
ignorant people I am dealing with I included your letter since
I thought it demonstrated my point more than anything I could
write
