Subject Re Israeli Terrorism

In article 1rd7eo1a4usenetINSCWRUEdu Anas Omran writes

ANAS There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
ANAS on the situation in the OT  But as most people used to see on TV the
ANAS Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the OT  The Israelis 
ANAS used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters  
ANAS So this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine
ANAS They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in 
ANAS Palestine

Bring me one case where Israeli Soldiers deliberately killed a neutral 
reporter  This is another one of your wet dreams

Unlike many countries Israel does allow reporters in and out of the OT 
That is what the problem is If Israel were a country like China then 
nothing would transpire from what is happening in the OT But there
seems to be a proliferation of journalists in Israel always trying to show
how evil the Israeli monster is Arab countries dont allow journalists 
anywhere we have yet to hear about the massacres of Kurds the destruction
and annihilation of Hama the killings of moslem fundamentalists in mosques
in Egypt and Algeria etc Why is it we only get state reports How accurate
are they
Anas go give a lesson of freedom of speech to your Arab bretheren before
telling us what to do
