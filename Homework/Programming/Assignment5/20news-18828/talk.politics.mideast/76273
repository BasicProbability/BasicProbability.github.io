Subject Hamza does it again

Hamza answers one of my articles

TO If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a Hamas Mujahid with an antitank
TO missile then Im almost sure that the terrorist zionists would not
TO have been able to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the
TO missile

Hamza maybe the missile didnt hit directly such that his body
Hamza gets desintegrated  of course destroying 10 houses to
Hamza kill someone is not a surgical operation or is it

Well done Hamza You edited my answer to Anas Omran took everything out
of context and then replied to it the way you wanted
Now I really understand why the peace process is not making any progress

You guys aint listening just babbling away to your same old rhetoric
