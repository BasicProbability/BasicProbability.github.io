Esin Terzioglu  Your ignorance is obvious from your posting 
Esin Terzioglu  1 Cyprus was an INDEPENDENT country with TurkishGreek 
		    inhabitants NOT a Greek island like your ignorant 
			posting claims
Esin Terzioglu  2 The name should be Cyprus in English
Esin Terzioglu  next time read and learn before you post 



Aside from spelling  why is that you TURKS DO NOT want to admit your
past MISTAKES  You know TURKISH INVASION of CYPRUS was a mistake and too
bad that UN DID NOT do anything about it You may ask  mistake 
Yes I would say Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS 


The Greeks did try to invade Cyprus just before the Turkish intervention They
failed Just for your info
