 I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
 reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
 reported accurately on what was happening in Germany It is
 interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda
 
 Since one is also unlikely to get the truth from either Arab or 
 Palestinian news outlets where do we go to understand to learn 
 Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another The only way 
 to determine that is to try and get beyond the writers political
 agenda whether it is on or against our side

To Andi

I have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources If you
want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news
directly from the source EVERY news source is inherently biased to some
extent and for various reasons both intentional and otherwise However 
the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the truth and to discern 
the bias 

Go read or listen to some Israeli media You will learn more news and more
opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so Then you can form your own
opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views dont 
change
