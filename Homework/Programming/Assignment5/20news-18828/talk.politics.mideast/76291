 Problem 1
 
 My father told me the following story During the famous wars between the 
 Armenians and the Persians prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary 
 heroic deeds Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops 
 The first time he struck down half of the Persian army The second time 
 pursuing the Persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers The third 
 time he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army The Persians who were 
 still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to Nakhichevan And so from 
 this remainder find how many Persian soldiers there were before the  
massacre
 

Answer a11214111280  a  1760


I thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the
remaining Persian troops on the second round and then 111 of those remaining
on the third round  This would mean

Answer a1  121  141  111  280    a  821333
