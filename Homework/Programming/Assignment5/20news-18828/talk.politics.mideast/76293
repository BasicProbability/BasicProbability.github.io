A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson
Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal

1      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
and the other PalestinianArab

5      The emergence of a considerable number of mixed
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society The existence of a strong mixed stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the

    Sounds just like a racial theory that Hitler outlined in Mein Kampf

Someone else said something similar  I will not comment on the
value or lack of value of Eliass proposal  I just want to say
that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine  They were NOT
like Eliass idea they were more like the opposite  

Nazis believed in racial purity not racial assimilation  An 
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies  According to 
Nazi theoreticians Gypsies were an Aryan race  They were persecuted
and in huge numbers murdered because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but mongrels formed from the pure Gypsy 
race and other undesirable races  This was the key difference between 
the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies by the way  It is also 
true that towards the end of WWII even the purist Gypsies were 
hunted down as the theory was forgotten
