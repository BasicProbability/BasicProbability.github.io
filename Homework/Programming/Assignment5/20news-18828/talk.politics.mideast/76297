Subject Re Clintons views on Jerusalem

 I recently read that during Bill Clintons campaign he stated
 that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
 Israels capital  According to the article Mr Clinton
 reaffirmed this after winning the presidency  However
 during recent talks with President Mubarak Secretary of
 State Christopher stated that the status of Jerusalem
 will be a final matter of discussion between the parties
 
 Now I dont want to start a big discussion over the status
 of Jerusalem  All I want to know is if anyone can 
 authenticate Mr Clintons statements with dates places etc
 

This would be one of the results of US backed  PEACE process

 Thank you
