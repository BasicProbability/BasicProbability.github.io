through private contributions on Federal land  Your hatemongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact intellectual content
and social value  Down the toilet it goes


And we all know what an unbiased source the NYT is when it comes to things
concerning Israel

Neither the Times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to
recognize the statement that these private funds were all tax exmpt  In
otherwords American taxpayers put up at least 30 of the money  And
finalyy how does Federal land mitigate the offensiveness of this alien
monument dedicated to perpetuating pitty and the continual flow of tax money
to a foreign entity

That Federal land and tax money could have been used to commerate
Americans or better yet to house homeless Americans

The donations are tax deductible like any donations to a nonprofit
organization  Ive donated money to a group restoring streetcars
and it was tax deductible  Why dont you contribute to a group
helping the homeless if you so concerned
