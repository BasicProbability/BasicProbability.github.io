  Well Panos Mr Tamamidis the way you put it it is only the Turks
  who bear the responsibility of the things happening today That is hard to
  believe for somebody trying to be objective
  When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
  blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides
  What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway
  Do you think it was your right to be there

Ive heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they dont read about
itRemember the Treaty of Sevresas a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWIThe Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie GreeksArmeniansKurdsI must say TurkKurd relations are 
improving slightly with time and not pose a threat to Turkeys neighbours
The Turks blatantly rejected this treatythe Germans grudgingly accepted 
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
German peopleThe Greeks who had an army therewere there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak alliesthis was after 
the Greek forces were were destroyed at SmyrnaWhen this occurred incidently
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the 
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed theyre way up the sides of the ships
Libertaeegalitaefraternatae
 
 There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 1923
 Someone had to protect them If not us who
 
  I am not saying that conflicts started with that It is only
  not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering
  It is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise
  I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
  visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey I thought it
  was a positive attempt to make the relations better
  
 Compromise on what the invasion of Cyprus the involment of Turkey in
 Greek politics the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial
 waters as stated by international law the properties of the Greeks of 
 Konstantinople the ownership of the islands in the Greek lakesorry Aegean
 
 There are some things on which there can not be a compromise
 
 
  The Greeks I mentioned who wouldnt talk to me are educated
  people They have never met me but they know I am bad person
  because I am from Turkey Politics is not my business and it is
  not the business of most of the Turks When it comes to individuals 
  why the hatred
 
 Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
 indirecly is a bad person
 It is not your nationality that makes you bad it is your support of the
 actions of your goverment that make you bad
 People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
 are You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
 as a such you must pay the price
 
  So that makes me think that there is some kind of
  brainwashing going on in Greece After all why would an educated person 
  treat every person from a nation the same way can you tell me about your 
  history books and things you learn about GreekTurkish
  encounters during your schooling 
  take it easy

  Achtung baby
 
 You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks Just talk to
 Greeks Arabs Slavs Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under
 Turkish occupation
 They will talk to you about murdersrapesdistruction
 
 You do not learn about Turks from history books you learn about them from
 people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness
 
 Napoleon


Well Napoleon It is your kind of people who are preventing peace 
on the world First of all you didnt answer the question I asked
at the end of my posting And then you told me some bullshit
throughout your posting which had no positive point about the issue
filled with hatred and filled with emotions Why am I doing this
Forget it I dont think you are worth it to discuss the issue
