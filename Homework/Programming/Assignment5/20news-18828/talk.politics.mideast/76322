Eh  Could you please give me details about an event where a Neutral
Observer was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier

Actually Im still trying to understand the selfjustifying rationale
behind the recent murder of Ian Feinberg  in Gaza

	Hate to be simple minded about this Tim but I think its
really very simple  He was a dirty Jew  And the only good Jew in
some peoples mind is a dead Jew  Thats what 40 years of propaganda
that fails to discriminate between Jew and Zionist will do  Thats
what 20 years of statements like the ones Ive appended will do to
someones mind  They make people sick  They drag down political
discourse to the point where killing your opponent is an honorable way
to resolve a dispute

	What else can come of such demagogery  Peace

Arafat on political pluralism

	Any Palestinian leader who suggests ending the intifada
	exposes himself to the bullets of his own people and
	endangers his life  The PLO will know how to deal with
	him

Arafat on the massacre at Tienamin Square

	  on behalf of the Arab Palestinian People their
        leadership and myself  I take this opportunity to express
        extreme gratification that you were able to restore normal order
        after the recent incidents in Peoples China

Yassir Arafat humanitarian

       Open fire on the new Jewish immigrants   be they from the
       Soviet Union Ethiopia or anywhere else  It would be a disgrace if
       we did not lift a finger while herds of immigrants settle our
       territory  I want you to shoot  It makes no difference if they
       live in Jaffa or Jericho  I give you explicit orders to open fire
       Do everything to stop the flow of immigration
	 Yassir Arafat Al Muharar Lebanese weekly April 10 1990

Yassir Arafat on genocide

	When the Arabs set off their volcano there will only be Arabs in
	this part of the world  Our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated
