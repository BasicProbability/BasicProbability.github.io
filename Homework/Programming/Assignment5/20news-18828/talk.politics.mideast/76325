Subject Re Final Solution for Gaza 

In article 1483500354igcapcorg Center for Policy Research cprigcapcorg writes


The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some 700000 people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

Anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking
hisher sources does not deserve to be believed  The Gaza strip does
not possess the highest population density in the world  In fact it
isnt even close  Just one example will serve to illustrate the folly
of this statement  the city of Hong Kong has nearly ten times the
population of the Gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area  The
centers of numerous cities also possess comparable if not far higher
population densities  Examples include Manhattan Island NY City Sao
Paolo Ciudad de Mexico Bombay 

Need I go on  The rest of Mr Davidssons message is no closer to the
truth than this oftrepeated statement is
