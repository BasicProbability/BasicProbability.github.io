There is one big difference between Israel and the Arabs Christians in this
respect

Israel allows freedom of religion

Avi
   For your information Islam permits freedom of religion  there is
no compulsion in religion  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
ie are nonJews recognized in Judaism  Just wondering

	In Islam there is no compulsion just a tax on dhimini  In
Judaism nonJews are allowed to do as they wish and there is no
effort made to convert them

If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors we sure
wouldnt waste them on members of Congress   John Perry Barlow
