	Other people have commented on most of this swill I figured
Id add a few comments of my own

The Gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks

	Hong Kong and Cairo both have higher population densities

The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza some 700000 people by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel

	There is no fundamental right to work in another country  And
the closing of the strip is not a punishment it is a security measure
to stop people from stabbing Israelis


The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance

	Dozens minus one since one of them was stabbed to death a few
days ago

wouldnt waste them on members of Congress   John Perry Barlow
