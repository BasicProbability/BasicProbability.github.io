    Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto 
    
 
    While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto they
    repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
    attempt to starve the Gazans
 
    
 
 The Jews in the Warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and
 their families from being sent to Nazi gas chambers Groups like Hamas
 and the Islamic Jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all
 Jews into the sea Perhaps we should persuade Jewish people to help
   
 these wnderful freedom fighters attain this ultimate goal
 
 Maybe the freedom fighters will choose to spare the cooperative Jews
 Is that what you are counting on Elias  the pity of murderers
 
 You say your mother was Jewish How ashamed she must be of her son I
 am sorry Mrs Davidsson

       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA 

I am sick and tired of this DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA sentance attributed
to Islamic movements and the PLO it simply cant be proven as part of their
plan 

This has been discussed before by several people on this net  The
statement is attributable either to Hajj Amin alHusseini former Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem  and the leader of the Palestinian death squads
during the 1948 war or to one of his chief henchmen  

It was not coined by Bnai Brith or for that matter any Jewish
organization
