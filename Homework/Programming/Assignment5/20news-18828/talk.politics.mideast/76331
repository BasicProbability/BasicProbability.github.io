Zionism and the Holocaust
 by Haim Bresheeth

The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history
of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
antisemitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet
of antiSemitism namely that Jews cannot live with non Jews

	Wrong  Zionism acknowledges the fact that antiSemites
exist and prevent Jews from living in peace  That does not mean we
agree that Jews are all greedy that Jews kill Christian Children
commited deicide or anything else  We acknowledge that there are
morons out there who do believe these things
