I only want to say that I agree with Noam on this point
and I hope that all sides stop targeting civilians

Absolutely Im sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased
if the fighters military guerilla whatever would just take their

At that point we will all breath a sigh of relief and cheer for
our side in the struggle
