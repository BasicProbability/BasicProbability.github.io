I am sick and tired of this DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA sentance
attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO it simply cant be proven
as part of their plan

	Ok Ill admit it  I cant find a quote with my meager online
resources  but i did find this little gem

	When the Arabs set off their volcano there will only be Arabs in
	this part of the world  Our people will continue to fuel the torch
	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
	occupied homeland is liberated
	 Yasser Arafat AP 31279

	So Ahmed is right  There was nothing about driving Jews into
the sea just a bit of ethnic cleansing and a river of blood

	Is this an improvement
