 I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
 reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
 reported accurately on what was happening in Germany It is
 interesting that you are basing the truth on Israeli propaganda
 
 If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda then 
 consider the Washington Posts handling of American events to be propoganda
 too  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion  I
 wouldnt compare it to Nazi propoganda either  Unless you want to provide
 some evidence of Israeli inaccuracies or parallels to Nazism I suggest you 
 keep your mouth shut  Im sick and tired of all you antisemites comparing
 Israel to the Nazis and yes in my opinion if you compare Israel to the Nazis
 you are an antisemite because you know damn well it isnt true and you are
 just trying to discredit Israel

You know ed  Youre right  Andi shouldnt be comparing
Israel to the Nazis  The Israelis are much worse than the
Nazis ever were anyway  The Nazis did a lot of good for
Germany and they would have succeeded if it werent for the
damn Jews  The Holocaust never happened anyway  Ample
evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard Dept of History
and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU have shown that the
Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel
