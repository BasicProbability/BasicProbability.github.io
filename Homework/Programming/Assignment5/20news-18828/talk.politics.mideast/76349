Eh  Could you please give me details about an event where a Neutral
Observer was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier


There are many cases but I do not remeber names  The Isralis shot and killed
a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada

I believe that most of the world has seen pictures of Israeli soldiers who
were breaking the cameras of the reporters kicking reporters out confiscating
cassettes and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going
to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports
