  I think the Israeli press might be a tad bit biased in
  reporting the events I doubt the Propaganda machine of Goering
                                                            

   and later as somebody informed you about your gross mistake you
   write in

  First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and
                                              
  not Goering Airforce who ran the Nazi propaganda machine

   instead of Joseph GOEBBELS And you dare to say that you
   know more about Nazi Germany than most people maybe including us  
   Im sure you learned the history of Nazi Germany AND Austria from
   your family  
  
 	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people
 names when they disagree with your position Opposing the
 atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies
 as antisemitism If you think name calling is a valid form of
 argument in intellectual circles you need to get out more
 often
 
  Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German
  Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance high intellect
  low humanity none and antisemitism average I respect anybody
  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a
  civilized manner I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel
  andor its politics is an antisemite except he uses antisemitic
  vocabularyterminologydemagogy Israel is not a perfect country and
  its politicians also commits errors even some of them are corrupt
  like politicians in any other country but they carry a huge burden
  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens and that is really not an
  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect
  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country and its
  Jewish citizens plus the socalled collaborators arabs that wanted to
  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours of the map As I said
  Israel is not a perfect country but it is the ONLY democracy in the
  whole MiddleEast and the only country in the world where Jews from
  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries
  they are living
  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on nonJewish
  nations and its governments as soon as there are more or les big
  socialeconomicalpolitical problems in any country the first ones
  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews and later the other
  minorities of the country
  
 I dont think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
                     
 justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government Any
 attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself antisemetic is
 not appreciated

  This is really outrageous 6000000 murdered Jews besides the
  thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another and the rest
  of the living ones mourning for all of them  I dont know what you
  call a Civil Libertarian never heard about them but I know only
  one thing if all of them think like you do it then Civil Libertarians
  is a new denomination for Antisemites May other Civil Libertarians come
  to word to this group so that we can learn if ABeyer and me are right
  that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites or that Im wrong and he is
  missusing that word
  BTW I couldnt care less for what Andi Beyer appreciates
