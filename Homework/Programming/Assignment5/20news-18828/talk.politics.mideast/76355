Subject Re Freedom In USA


In a previous article jaa12cunixacccolumbiaedu John A Absood says

It is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom
of racism and violent deragatory

It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial 
distinction

I couldnt agree more  Canada has an antihate law which exists to punish
those who wilfully spread false propaganda lies for the purpose of 
putting down another group  This is actually the law that David Irving
will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust
Its too bad that this useless Centre for Policy Research isnt in Canada
Itd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace
