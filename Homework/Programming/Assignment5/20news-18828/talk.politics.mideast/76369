    Unlike the PLOs almost exclusive focus on civilian targets the
100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April 10 1948 targeted the village for its military importance
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem which the Arabs had

Since Facts and Myths doesnt even know where Deir Yassin was
why should we pay any attention to the rest of what it says

blockaded and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem

    Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to
paint The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about
250 In 1983 however Eric Silver of The Guardian Britain
interviewed a survivor Mophammed Sammour who testified that 116 out
of a population of 8001000 were killed About three days after the
massacre Sammour explained representatives of each of the five
clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found alive We went through the
names  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure
was wrong

This account from Eric Silver is the only valid point that MF makes
You can find it together with other evidence and analysis in 
Silvers biography of Begin  Also in Silvers book you will find
documentary evidence that nearly everything else in MFs account
is pure bullshit

    Unlike the PLOs deliberate attacks on civilians the killing of
civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated The attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left
unharmed After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the Jewish troops some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately Independent observers told The Guardian
that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women

This is pretty disgusting  The Guardian was told of one or two
feeble old men who dressed in womens clothing in a pathetic 
attempt to escape death  See Silvers book
