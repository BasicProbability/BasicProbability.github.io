   Eh  Could you please give me details about an event where a Neutral
   Observer was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier
   

   There are many cases but I do not remeber names  The Isralis shot and killed
   a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada


Not exactly the same but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte who was the UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of
independence  He was killed by the Israelis  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a ceasefire which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel compared to continued war
