Subject Re Freedom In USA

 Freedom of speech does not mean that others are compelled to give one
 the means to speak publicly  Some systems have regulations
 prohibiting the dissemination of racist and bigoted messages from
 accounts they issue
 
 Apparently thats not the case with virginiaedu since you are still
 posting

First of all Im still baffled what you possibly could have
found racist in my argument for freedom of speach I did not
mention names nationalities countries let alone races 
	You are right in that Virginiaedu does not have a
thought police like Israelnysernetorg seems to I didnt know
that you guys are getting a privelege by the Israelis by
getting the means to speak publicly Virginiaedu lets EVERY
student regardless of their opinion to speak their mind 
	Virginiaedu is true to its founding father Thomas
Jefferson the author of the bill of rights in allowing freedom
of speach Sorry you guys in israel have a hard time with the
concept
