I am born in Palestine now Israel I have family there The lack of
peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life

Bullshit  Youve been in Iceland for the past 30 years  You told us
so yourself  It had something to do with not wanting to suffer the
fate of your mother who has lived with Jews for a long time or
somesuch  Sounded awful

I am concerned by Palestine Israel because I want peace to come to
it Peace AND justice 

Are you as concerned about peace and justice in Palestine Jordan

Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical The first
party has a state and the other has none The first is an occupier and
the second the occupied 

Lets say that Israel grants the PLO EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR
That Israel goes back to the 1967 borders  What will the Palestinean
Arabs in TelAviv call themselves  The Palestineans in West
Jerusalem  In Haifa  Will they still claim to be occupied

Or do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs
much as the Arabs did to their Jews

Indeed there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in
the ME  And most of this lack of symmetry does NOT favor Israel
