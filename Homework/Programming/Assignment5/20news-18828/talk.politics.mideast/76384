  ALL Jews suffered during WWII not just our beloved who perished or were 
  tortured  We ALL suffered  
 
 	All humans suffered emotionally some Jews and many
 others suffered physically 
 
 Im just waiting for Andi to tell us that African Americans should
 start paying compensation to White Americans who suffered from being 
 slave owners
 
	Do you have a problem with the language I said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
victims of Holocaust I wasnt implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims Neither was I implying any
wrongdoing on the part of the Jews as the cause for the
Holocaust What is wrong with you guys Regardless of what one 
says you keep hearing what you want to hear
