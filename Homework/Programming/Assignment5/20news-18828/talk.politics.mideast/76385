	Virginiaedu is true to its founding father Thomas
Jefferson the author of the bill of rights in allowing freedom
of speach Sorry you guys in israel have a hard time with the
concept

Jefferson was not the author of the Bill of Rights  My history
books arent here but Jefferson might have been in the group
that did not think that enumerating rights was necessary
Cheers
Steve
