EP This has been discussed before by several people on this net  The
EP statement is attributable either to Hajj Amin alHusseini former Grand
EP Mufti of Jerusalem  and the leader of the Palestinian death squads
EP during the 1948 war or to one of his chief henchmen  

 In Russia General Dro the Butcher the architect of the Turkish
 genocide in WWI was working closely with the German Secret 
 Service He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired
 important intelligence about the Soviets His experience with
 the Turkish genocide in xSoviet Armenia made him an invaluable 
 source for the Germans2

What a fool For the above to be true which it is not the WWI Russian
General Dro must have worked from his grave to assist xSoviet Armenia
Soviet Armenia became exSoviet Armenia in 1991 and Dro died in 1958 Then
Dro would have to travel back in time while dead from 1991 to WWII to help
Nazi Germany
