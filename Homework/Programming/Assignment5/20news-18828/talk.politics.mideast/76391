       Oh yes I just remembered While they were raping me they      
        repeated quite frequently Let the Armenian women have babies  
        for us Muslim babies let them bear Azerbaijanis for the       
        struggle against the Armenians Then they said Those         
        Muslims can carry on our holy cause Heroes They repeated     
        it very often

Im thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in
Armenia now We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fatesthe
price was too great Now after the Sumgait tragedy we the victims divide
our lives into before and after We talk like that that was before the
war Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole
epoch a fate No matter how many years go by no matter how long we live
it will never be forgotten On the contrary some of the moments become even 
sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now
   They say that you can see more with distance and we can see those
inhuman events with more clarity now    we more acutely perceive our
losses and everything that happened

Nineteen eightyeight was a leap year Everyone fears a leap year and wants it
to pass as quickly as possible Yet we never thought that that leap year would
be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian those who lost someone and 
those who didnt

That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you 
could already smell danger in the air But we didnt think that the danger was
near and possible so we didnt take any steps to save ourselves At least as
my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children 
My parents themselves are not that old 52 and 53 years But then they thought
that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us

In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28 around five in the
afternoon I call it a tragedy and I repeat it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived When I recall how they broke down our door my skin
crawls even now among Armenians among people who wish me only well I feel
like its all starting over again I remember how that mob broke into our 
apartment    My parents were standing in the hall My father had an axe in 
his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors Our door was rarely 
locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by Were known as a 
hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people 
who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis Jews or Russians We had friends
of many nationalities even a Turkmen woman

My parents were in the hall my father with an axe I remember him telling my 
mother Run to the kitchen for a knife But Mother was detached pale as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer To be honest I never 
expected it of her shes afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark A 
girlfriend was at the house that day a Russian girl Lyuda and Mamma said 
No matter what happens no matter what they do to us youre not to come out 
of the bedroom Were going to tell them that were alone in the apartment

We went into the bedroom There were four of us Marina and the Russian girl 
crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and
Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another The idea that 
perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside 
me Im an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately I wanted to
embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second And maybe Karina 
was thinking the same thing but shes quite reserved We didnt have time to 
say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout 
There was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from
excited voices I couldnt figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack But when Mamma shouted the second time
Karina ran out of the bedroom I ran after her I had wanted to hold her back
but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us 
immediately The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me at 
least so as to save Marina and her friend The mob was shouting all of their 
eyes were shining all red like from insomnia At first about 40 people burst
in but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldnt see They 
came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other 
room He didnt utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but Mamma 
snatched the axe from behind and said Tell them not to touch the children 
Tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children She
said this to Father in Armenian

There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in They 
understood Armenian perfectly The local Azerbaijanis dont know Armenian 
they dont need to speak it And one of them responded in Armenian You and 
your children both    were going to do the same thing to you and your 
children that you Armenians did in Kafan They killed our women our girls 
our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses     and 
so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you This whole time
some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us They 
were mostly young people under 30 At first there werent any older people 
among them And all of their faces were unfamiliar Sumgait is a small town 
all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me Im 
a teacher

So they dragged my father into the other room They twisted his arms and took 
him in there no they didnt take him in there they dragged him in there
because he was already unable to walk They closed the door to that room all 
but a crack We couldnt see what was happening to Father what they were 
doing to him Then a young man about 26 years old started to tear off 
Mammas sarafan and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani Im old enough to 
be your mother What are you doing He struck her Now hes being held 
Mamma identified him I hope hes convicted Then they went after Karina 
whos been talking to them like a Komsomol leader as though she were trying 
to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their 
consciousness She told them that what they were doing was wrong that they 
mustnt do it She said Come on lets straighten this out without 
emotions What do you want Who are you Why did you come here What did we 
ever do to you Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come 
into our home but then the ones in the backmore of them kept coming and 
comingsaid What are you talking to them for You should kill them We 
came here to kill them

They pushed Karina struck her and she fell down They beat her but she 
didnt cry out Even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating What
did we do to you What did we do to you And even later when she came to 
she said Mamma what did we do to them Why did they do that to us

That group was prepared I know this because I noticed that some of them only 
broke up furniture and others only dealt with us I remember that when they 
were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off I felt neither pain 
nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina All I could do 
was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they
did to her Thats why I felt no pain Later when they carried Karina off 
they beat her savagely    Its really amazing that she not only lived but 
didnt lose her mind  She is very beautiful and they did everything they 
could to destroy her beauty Mostly they beat her face with their fists 
kicking her using anything they could find

Mamma Karina and I were all in one room And again I didnt feel any pain 
just didnt feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they 
did Then one of those creeps said that there wasnt enough room in the
apartment They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the 
corners so there would be more room Then someone suggested Lets take her 
outside

Those beasts were in Heaven They did what they would do every day if they 
werent afraid of the authorities Those were their true colors At the time 
I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they werent 
afraid of what would happen to them

When they carried Karina out and beat Mammaher face was completely covered 
with bloodthats when I started to feel the pain I blacked out several 
times from the pain but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though 
I were recording it all on film I think Im a kind person by nature but Im 
vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and I dont deserve it I hold 
a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain And every time 
I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me Id remember them 
and Ill remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me 
forget you have to forget you have to go on living

At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something and 
despite the fact that I hurt all overI had been beaten terriblyI found
the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures I realized that I had
to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering 
to an end I pushed one of them away he was a real horse I remember now that
hes being held too As though they were all waiting for it they seized me
and took me out onto the balcony I had long hair and it was stuck all over
me One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up
with their hands I was up in the air As though for the last time I took a 
really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside I 
suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet And suddenly 
I felt myself flying I couldnt figure out if I was really flying or if I 
just imagined it When I came to I thought now Im going to smash on the 
ground And when it didnt happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was 
still lying on the floor And since I didnt scream didnt beg them at all
they became all the more wild like wolves They started to trample me with
their feet Shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe
cially put them on Then I lost consciousness

I came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it 
Some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment I didnt 
need any of those things I was sure that none of us would survive and I had 
even forgotten about Marina and if none of us was alive it wasnt worth 
living

There was a moment when the pain was especially great I withstood inhuman 
pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come 
because I had showed myself to be so tenacious I started to strangle myself 
and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to
put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat The 
person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well 
because he was the oldest in the group He looked around 48 I know that he 
has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person 
one who would never do such a thing Something came over him then you see 
even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized 
although of course he knew that Id never forgive him Something like that 
I can never forgive I have never injured anyone with my behavior with my 
words or with my deeds I have always put myself in the other persons shoes
but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely I shall never 
forget it

I wanted to do myself in then because I had nothing to lose because no one 
could protect me My father who tried to do something against that hoard of 
beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldnt be able to do anything
I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive

And Ira Melkumian my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of timesher brother tried to save her and couldnt so he tried to 
kill her his very own sister He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an 
end to her suffering When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into 
the other room her brother knew what awaited her I dont know which one it 
was Edik or Igor Both of them were in the room from which the axe was 
thrown But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her 
and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all 
the deaths of those days in Sumgait I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians landing His name is Makhaddin he knows my family a 
little He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku
how we were feeling and if we needed anything Hes a good person He said 
You should praise God that you all survived But what I saw with my own eyes
I a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life I he
says nearly lost my mind that day I had never seen the likes of it and 
think I never shall again The door to his apartment was open and he saw 
everything One of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken 
the father and mother out of the apartment Igor Edik and Ira remained He 
saw Ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven
people He told us about it and said he would never forget it He heard the 
brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that 
they were powerless to do anything But all the same they tried to 
do something The guy who got hit with the axe lived                                                                           I     I

After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and 
Lyuda out of the bedroom I was in such a state that I couldnt even 
remember my sisters name I wanted to cry Marina out to her but could
not I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldnt
for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was And thus
I saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had
told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both
there by chance that they werent Armenians Lyudas a Russian you can tell 
right away and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that
she was an Azerbaijani And I almost gave her away and doomed her Im glad 
that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health    
although her spirit was murdered   

At some point I came to and saw Igor Igor Agayev my acquaintance in that 
mob He lives in the neighboring building For some reason I remembered his 
name maybe I sensed my defense in him I called out to him in Russian Igor
help But he turned away and went into the bedroom Just then they were 
taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom Igor said he knew Marina and 
Lyuda that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani and he took both of them to the 
neighbors

And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment 
something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me
 
Then they were striking me very hardwe have an Indian vase a metal one 
they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked outthey took me out 
onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window They were already 
sure that I was dead because I didnt react at all to the new blows Someone 
said Shes already dead lets throw her out When they carried me out onto
the balcony for the second time when I was about to die the second time I 
heard someone say in Azerbaijani Dont kill her I know her shes a 
teacher I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but I cant remember
whose voice it was It wasnt Igor because he speaks Azerbaijani with an 
accent his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home He speaks
Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does I remember when they carried me in and
threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and 	I having opened my 
eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold I had 
been beaten so much that I didnt have the strength to remember him I only 
remember that this person was older and he had a high position Unfortunately 
I cant remember anything more

What should I say about Igor He didnt treat me badly I had heard a lot 
about him that he wasnt that good a person that he sometimes drank too
much Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan He knew that 
women usually like bravery in a man Especially if a man was in Afghanistan
if he was wounded then its about eighty percent sure that he will be treated
very sympathetically with respect Later I found out that he had served in 
Ufa and was injured but thats not in Afghanistan of course I found that 
all out later

Among the people who were in our apartment my Karina also saw the Secretary 
of the Party organization I dont know his last name his first name is 
Najaf he is an Armenianborn Azerbaijani But later Karina wasnt so sure
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she 
didnt want to endanger him She said He was there and a little while 
later Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else 
No it seems like it was he I am sure it was he because when he came to see 
us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something 
entirely different The investigators havent summoned him yet He came to see
us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time He brought 
groceries and flowers this was right before March 8th he almost started 
crying he was so upset to see our condition I dont know if he was putting 
us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned 
him to the Procuracy he said that he had been in Baku he wasnt in Sumgait 
The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is 
right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment I dont know how the 
investigators are now treating him At one point I wondered and asked and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment Couldnt he have gone 
to Baku and arranged an alibi Im not ruling out that possibility

Ill now return to our apartment Mamma had come to You could say that she 
bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married her 
wedding band and her watch were gold She bought her own and her husbands 
lives with them She gave the gold to a 14year old boy Vadim Vorobyev A 
Russian boy he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly Hes an orphan who was raised by
his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street He goes to a 
special school one for mentally handicapped children But Ill say thisIm 
a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinionthat
boy is not at all mentally handicapped Hes healthy he can think just fine 
and analyze too    policemen should be so lucky And hes cunning too 
After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album

He beat Mamma and demanded gold saying Lady if you give us all the gold 
and money in your apartment well let you live And Mamma told them where 
the gold was He brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and 
everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other 
over and taking the gold from one another Im surprised they didnt kill one 
another right then

Mamma was still in control of herself She had been beaten up her face was
black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she 
ran into the other room Father was lying there tied up with a gag in his
mouth and a pillow over his face There was a broken table on top of the pil
low Mamma grabbed Father and he couldnt walk like me he was half dead 
halfway into the other world He couldnt comprehend anything couldnt see 
and was covered with black and blue Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth 
it was some sort of cloth I think it was a slipcover from an armchair

The bandits were still in our apartment even in the room Mamma pulled Father 
out of led him out of carried him out of We had two armchairs in that room
a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen Three people 
were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants 
everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee
serviceMamma saw them out of the corner of her eye She said I was afraid 
to turn around I just seized Father and started pulling him but at the 
threshold I couldnt hold him up he fell down and I picked him up again and 
dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors Mamma remembered one of the 
criminals the one who had watched her with his face halfturned toward her 
out of one eye She says I realized that my death would come from that 
person I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing
Later they caught that scoundrel Meanwhile Mamma grabbed Father and left

I was alone Igor had taken Marina away Mamma and Father were gone Karina 
was already outside I didnt know what they were doing to her I was left all
alone and at that moment    I became someone else do you understand Even
though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room nor Marina and
Lyuda under the bed could save me all the same I somehow managed to hold out
I went on fighting them I bit someone I remember and I scratched another 
But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were the ones 
I had observed the ones who beat Karina what kind of people they were the 
ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that I was about to die and 
that all of that would die with me

At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building I 
didnt know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that
we were from the same microdistrict When I saw him I said Neighbor is that
you In so doing I placed myself in great danger He realized that if I lived
I would remember him Thats when he grabbed the axe The axe that had been 
taken from my father I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery When he 
started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room 
The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbors axe froze in 
the air Everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the 
presence of a general Everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities 
or not He said Enough lets go to the third entryway In the third 
entryway they killed Uncle Shurik Aleksandr Gambarian This confirms once 
again that they had prepared in advance Almost all of them left with him as 
they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they 
found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had 
already taken the other

Four people remained in the room soldiers who didnt obey their general They
had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over
those 2 to 3 hours but I had never seen those three One of them Kuliyev I 
identified him later a native of the Sisian District of Armenia an 
Azerbaijani had moved to Azerbaijan a year before He told me in Armenian
Sister dont be afraid Ill drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here
Thats just what he said those Azerbaijanis as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred Ill drive
them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut because theyll be coming back from Apartment 41 
Thats when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41 Before that the 
person in the Eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened 
to the general said that they were going to the third entryway

Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l couldnt do it by myself 
Marinas old fur coat was lying on the floor He threw it over my shoulders I
was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer 
He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut 
But the door was lying on the floor in the hall

I went out onto the balcony There were broken windows and flowers and dirt 
from flowerpots were scattered on the floor It was impossible to find 
anything He told me Well fine I wont leave you here Would any of the 
neighbors let you in Theyll be back they wont calm down they know youre 
alive He told me all this in Armenian

Then he returned to the others and said What are you waiting for Leave 
They said Ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her 
yourself No we want to do it to He urged them on but gently not 
coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just
boys not old enough to be drafted He led them out of the room and went
down to the third floor with them himself and said Leave Whats the mat
ter arent you men Go fight with the men What do you want of her And
he came back upstairs They wanted to come up after him and he realized that 
he couldnt hold them off forever Then he asked me where he could hide me I 
told him at the neighbors on the fourth floor Apartment 10 we were on really
good terms with them

We knocked on the door and he explained in Azerbaijani The neighbor woman 
opened the door and immediately said Im an Azerbaijani He said I know 
Let her sit at your place a while Dont open the door to anyone no one knows
about this I wont tell anyone Let her stay at your place She says Fine
have her come in I went in She cried a bit and gave me some stockings I 
had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders I burst into 
tears Even though I was wearing Marinas old fur coat its a short one a 
halflength I was cold all the same I asked Do you know where my family 
is what happened to them She says No I dont know anything Im afraid 
to go out of the apartment now theyre so wild that they dont look to see 
whos Azerbaijani and whos Armenian Kuliyev left Ten minutes later my 
neighbor says You know Lyuda I dont want to lose my life because of you 
or my son and his wife Go stay with someone else During the butchery in our
apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouthI had pearl
earrings onand ripped it out tearing the earlobe The other earring was 
still there When Im nervous I fix my hair constantly and then when I 
touched my ear I noticed that I had one earring on I took it out and gave it
to her She took the earring but she led me out of the apartment

I went out and didnt know where to go I heard someone going upstairs I 
dont know who it was but assumed it was them With tremendous difficulty I 
end up to our apartment I wanted to die in my own home I go into the 
apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor 
I had to do something I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had 
hidden and saw that the bed was overturned Instead of hiding I squatted near 
some broken Christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing 
Then they came in Someone said that there were still some things to take I 
think that someone pushed me under the bed I lay on the floor and there were
broken ornaments on it under my head and legs I got all cut up but I lay 
there without moving My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town 
could hear it There were no lights on Maybe thats what saved me They were 
burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle They started
picking out the clothes that could still be worn They took Fathers sport 
jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head They pulled on the
one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out I almost cried out 
And again I realized I wasnt getting out of there alive and I started to 
strangle myself again I took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on 
my mouth so as not to wheeze so that I would die and they would only find me
afterward They were throwing the burned matches under the bed and I got 
burned but I withstood it Something inside of me held on someones hand was
protecting me to the end I knew that I was going to die but I didnt know 
how I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment but if 
I found out that one of my family had died I would die for sure because I 
had never been so close to death and couldnt imagine how you could go on 
living without your mother or father or without your sister Marina I 
thought was still alive she went to Lyudas place or someone is hiding her 
I tried to think that Igor wouldnt let them be killed He served in 
Afghanistan he should protect her

While I was strangling myself I said my goodbyes to everyone And then I
thought how could Marina survive alone If they killed all of us how would 
she live all by herself There were six people in the room They talked among 
themselves and smoked One talked about his daughter saying that there was no
childrens footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter 
Another said that he liked the apartmentrecently we had done a really good 
job fixing everything upand that he would live there after everything was 
all over They started to argue A third one says How come you get it I 
have four children and there are three rooms here thats just what I need 
All these years Ive been living in Godawful places Another one says 
Neither of you gets it Well set fire to it and leave Then someone said 
that Azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their
place And they to my good fortune didnt set fire to the apartment and
left

Oh yes I just remembered While they were raping me they repeated quite 
frequently Let the Armenian women have babies for us Muslim babies let 
them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians Then they 
said Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause Heroes They repeated it 
very often
