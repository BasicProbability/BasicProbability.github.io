Eh  Could you please give me details about an event where a Neutral
Observer was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier


There are many cases but I do not remeber names  The Isralis shot and killed
a UN observer in Gaza in the first half of Intifada

That doesnt answer my question  Can you give a proof that it is an official
policy of any Israeli government to kill neutral observers or UN personel
or others like them

I wasnt sure that your original statement was wrong and was prepared to
recieve proofs that you are right  since I dont follow the events closely
Your last response made me pretty damn sure that at least YOU cant give such
a proof  and you made your original statement without much ground to put it
on

I believe that most of the world has seen pictures of Israeli soldiers who
were breaking the cameras of the reporters kicking reporters out
confiscating
cassettes and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going
to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports

Even if its true and in this case Id take it without asking you to prove it
it is still far from killing reporters  Also whenever that happened Ill bet
it happened as individual actions by certain soldiers and not as a policy of
the government  eg see the Hawara case where a colonel was sentenced for
giving orders to kick Arabs  as far as I remember

Bye
