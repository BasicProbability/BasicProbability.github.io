   You know ed  Youre right  Andi shouldnt be comparing
   Israel to the Nazis  The Israelis are much worse than the
   Nazis ever were anyway  The Nazis did a lot of good for
   Germany and they would have succeeded if it werent for the
   damn Jews  The Holocaust never happened anyway  Ample
   evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard Dept of History
   and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU have shown that the
   Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
   sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel

   Just kidding

Be careful rj3s When people start finding humour in the Holocaust
they often run the danger of exposing themselves for the hateful
refuse that they really are
