 Noam



I only want to say that I agree with Noam on this point
and I hope that all sides stop targeting civilians

Basil 

Absolutely Im sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased
if the fighters military guerilla whatever would just take their
argument elsewhere find an unpopulated area somewhere and slug it out  
At that point we will all breath a sigh of relief and cheer for
our side in the struggle

Ah but when you fire at armed folks they have this nasty habit of
firing back A simple terrorist could get hurt that way
