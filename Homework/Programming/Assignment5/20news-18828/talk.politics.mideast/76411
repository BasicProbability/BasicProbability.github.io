    Besides theres no case that can be made for US military involvement
    there that doesnt apply equally well to say Liberia Angola or
    it appears with the Khmer Rouges new campaign Cambodia   Nonwhites
    dont count

  Hmmsome might say Kuwaitis are nonwhite Ooops I forgot Kuwaitis are
  oil rich loaded with petrodollars etc so they dont count

and lets not forget Somalia which is about as far from white as it
gets

Not according to reports I have read It seems that the Somalis think
of our African American Marines in less than complimentary terms using
gestures that signify a word I refuse to use Seems that even when you
try to help people they still insult you


Thats two in a row care to try for more
