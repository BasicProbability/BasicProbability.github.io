what he wrote He wrote

Happy 45 birth day of Israel

and I worte

 
 HAMID Anybody has any information about the number of the people have been 
 HAMID killed by Israel  during these 44 HAPPY YEAR
 
 Not sure  But the number of Israelis killed defending Israel is a little more
 than 17000 in the last 45 years and 61000 injured
 

Is this means that  the number of the people have been killed by Israel are so
high that you can not keep the track of or this is also a part of Zionism 
ideology that you dont need to keep  the track of the people you kill 
Just kill
