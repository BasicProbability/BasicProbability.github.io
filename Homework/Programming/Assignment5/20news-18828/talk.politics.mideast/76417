Subject PBS Frontline documentary  Memory of the camps

Yesterday I watched an outstanding documentary on PBS prepared for Frontline
by the documentary consortia  It is called Memory of the camps and shows some
uncensored pictures taken immediately after the liberation of BergenBelsen
and other death camps
  
I recommend it to everybody  Check with your PBS station for rebroadcast
IT IS A MUST SEE documentary  
   
In the Seatle Vancouver area KSTS9 will rebroadcast the documentary
on Monday 0130 am
You can also order a copy from PBS Video 18003287271  The cost is 5995
