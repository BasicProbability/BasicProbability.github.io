  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism
OK youve already disqualified yourself who ever you are from
being objective

  You all are an insult to you race
assuming you are also semitic

Jews are a people with a common cultural heritage religion and history
We are not a race


	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 1930s and 1940s  The Hirgun and other branch 
off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers

You dont see a difference between killing British soldiers who were
preventing Jews who tried to escape the Nazis from entering the
British mandate and Arab terrorist who kill civilian men women and
children


I mention this not because Im anti semitic Im part
Jewish

Thats ridiculuous on atleast two counts  First of all even if you identify
yourself as completely Jewish that doesnt rule out the possibility that youre
a selfhating antisemite  One can always find Jews who are uncomfortable with
their identities since they only want Jews to be cowering victims and are
willing to speak up for their enemies  Secondly the strength or weakness of
your arguments does not depend on your identity
