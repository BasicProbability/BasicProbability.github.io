Jack Schmidling arfgenesisMCSCOM writes

	That Federal land and tax money could have been
	used to commerate Americans or better yet to house
	homeless Americans

jimspecialixcom Jim Maurer responds

	Why dont you contribute to a group helping the
	homeless if you so concerned


In article 1r7o4dkjdgenesisMCSCOM
Jack Schmidling arfgenesisMCSCOM reveals the true depths
of his cynicism

	I do did contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but
	when interest rates plumetted I just paid it off

	The problem is I couldnt convince Congress to move
	my home to a nicer location on Federal land


In other words Mr Schmidling could care less for the plight
of the homeless but is not above using them to score points
for his agenda
