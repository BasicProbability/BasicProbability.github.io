You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology

Thats true  I try to learn from people who know more than me
not from useless farts

And anyone who doesnt agree with you is by your own definitions a
useless fart  Just like any text that disputes your own findings
is always described as flawed or biased  In other words you
trumpet the things you like and dismiss those that might embarass you
Weve seen you play these games here for a long time

One thing is for sure When it comes to useless farts you sure know 
what youre talking about
