In article 1483500355igcapcorg cprigcapcorg Center for Policy Research writes

The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history
of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
antisemitism is impossible Zionism agrees with the basic tenet
of antiSemitism namely that Jews cannot live with non Jews

Thats why the Zionists decided that Zion must be Gentilerein
What  They didnt  You mean to tell me that the early Zionists
actually granted CITIZENSHIP in the Jewish state to Christian and
Muslim people too  

It seems Elias that your first point to note is wrong so the rest
of your posting isnt worth much either
