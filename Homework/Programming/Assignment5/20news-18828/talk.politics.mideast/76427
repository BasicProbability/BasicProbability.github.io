The Israeli Lefts inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War  Because of the
Palestinians popular solidarity with Iraq Yossi Sarid 
currently Minister of the Environment  made his infamous
statement You look for me  ie Iam not making any more
efforts to speak with you From Yossi Sarids point of view
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party Similarly
MERETZ MK Deddi Tzuker recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
governments and his partys lack of action for human rights and
peace responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government From the Leftists
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government regardless of what it does

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there 

When someone starts criticizing the Leftists for not being Leftist
enough we get a pretty clear idea of what they believe to be normal
I hope that your not still calling yourself fair and unbiased Elias
