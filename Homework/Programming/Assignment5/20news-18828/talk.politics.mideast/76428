 In a previous article friedenbsapphireegrmsuedu Gedaliah Friedenberg says

 
 For all those interested I would like to inform all that Binyamin Netanyahu
 leader of the Israeli Likud party will be interviewed on CNN tonight on
 Larry King Live


 didnt this guy go crying on the zionist tv confessing
 that he committed adultary and was cheating on his wife

 a typical jew leader huh

 Yes  He is  Actually the typical MuslimArab leader hides the fact that he
 commited adultery by choosing a camel over his husband or a small male child
 whichever is more readily availible

But the irony is that the Jewish population has no problem in electing
a leader who has CONFESSED  to having an extra marrital affair

This is a first

What else do you expect  Israel is trying to portray itself
as the great democracy  One requirement is to have a leader
who previously had an extramarital affair eg Bill Clinton
It helps if your wife says its OK
