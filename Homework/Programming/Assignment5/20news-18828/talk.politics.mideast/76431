Subject Re Freedom In USA

In article 1993Apr270056198351VirginiaEDU ab4zVirginiaEDU Andi Beyer writes

     This is actually the law that David Irving
    will hopefully be found guilty under due to his denial of the Holocaust
    Its too bad that this useless Centre for Policy Research isnt in Canada
    Itd set a nice precedent to how the law applies in Cyberspace

	   Well canada is wrong If it was in the US the ACLU would have
   made sure that such repressive laws are found unconstitutional
   Do you think the Church didnt find Galileos perception of the
   universe offensive


Bull shit There is no reason in the world why we cant say that
taking views analogous to the KKKs or some such organization is
wrong There is no reason why some morality may not be legislated As
it is we do not allow theft or murder or rape Why should we allow
hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence
