Can someone elaborate a little on what this Libertarian movement is I
am not going to draw conclusions from a small sample but so far I
recall two selfdescribed Libertarians posting here Both seems to be

1 Incredibly ignorant
2 Incredibly arrogant
3 All they want is to get people angry
4 Posses a lousy sense of humor
5 write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical
   connection between topics
6 Describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable although everything
   in their posters points to the opposite
7 Very childish

	The Libertarians believe in getting the government off the
backs of the people so that the free market can solve problems

	Libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state an end to
government subsidies of all sorts  The basic idea is that the
government is way too big and way too expensive and should be shrunk
down to a reasonable size

	They also believe in a complete end to foreign aid including
the stationing of American troops overseas  We can not and should not
be policing the world


	I agree that the people who come into this group and describe
themselves as Libertarians seem to posses the charictaristics you
describe but heck were not all like this  Im a libertarian and
Ive got a great sense of humor
