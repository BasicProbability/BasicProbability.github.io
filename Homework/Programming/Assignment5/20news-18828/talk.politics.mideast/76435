 	All humans suffered emotionally some Jews and many
 others suffered physically 


	Do you have a problem with the language I said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
victims of Holocaust I wasnt implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims

	Quite a few people couldnt have cared less about what
happened to the Jews of Europe  If they had cared they would have
done something

What is wrong with you guys Regardless of what one 
says you keep hearing what you want to hear 

	Maybe its because many of us who have been on usenet for
several years remember tripe like this being posted



For all those interested I would like to inform all that Binyamin Netanyahu
leader of the Israeli Likud party will be interviewed on CNN tonight on
Larry King Live  

didnt this guy go crying on the zionist tv confessing
that he committed adultary and was cheating on his wife

a typical jew leader huh

	This was posted fairly recently  There has been much more
racist stuff in the past  Why are we expected to listen to it and
remain calm  I dont think that listening to racist or antisemetic
slurs is an incitement to calm debate

	Perhaps you dont mean to be coming off as highly offensive
However the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have
an irrational dislike for Israel and Jews  Perhaps if you took a
close look at what youve posted thought a bit about the combatative
tone youve used you would see why people are reacting the way they
are
