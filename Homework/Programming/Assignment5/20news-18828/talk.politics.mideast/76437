Rabin We Must Concentrate on Qualitative Changes in Israeli
Society
 
Todays AL HAMISHMAR quotes Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabins
Independence Day interview yesterday on Israel Television Rabin
said that enforcing Jewish sovereignty over the entire Land of
Israel would lead to the establishment of a binational state I
would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation Dor
Tashach the generation that had the great privilege of determining
the fate of the people and founding the Jewish state had been
lost  Rabin added We must stop dreaming of settlements ie in
the Territories and focus on qualitative and substantive changes
in Israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its
own labor The Prime Minister concluded saying that he would like
to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during
his governments term
