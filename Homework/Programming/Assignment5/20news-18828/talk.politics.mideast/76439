Subject Re Happy Birthday Israel

In article 390jcpltyoJCPLCOJP ohayonjcpltyoJCPLCOJP Tsiel Ohayon writes

Does anybody know how many Jews Arabs Christians and others have died 
in terrorist attacks and wars over these 45 years due to Arab rhetoric and 
rejectionism The number is probably close to 100000 at least

All these lives wasted because the ARABS did not accept the PARTITION PLAN 
in 1947

Well over 100000 in Lebanon alone
1000000  2000000 in the IranIraq conflict even if Iranians
arent Arabs strictly speaking  They seem to hate the Zionists at
least as much as anyone else in the neighborhood  Is there some
correlation perhaps between hating Israel and killing off your own
people
