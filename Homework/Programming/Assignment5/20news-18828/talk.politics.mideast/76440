Peace Talks Resume Today Israel to Offer Palestinians New
			   Proposals
 
Israel Radio KOL YISRAEL reports on todays resumption in
Washington of the bilateral peace talks following a recess which
lasted over four months According to the report Israel is
expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the
authority of the Palestinian Executive Council general elections
control over land and human rights issues in the Territories
Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control
of more land than previously offered 

According to the radio
report one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians
control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands as
well as broad authority on water issues Israel will seek to
promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of
strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the
peace negotiations According to Israel Radio the Israeli
delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer
greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council
allowing it certain legislative capabilities without making it a
symbol for Palestinian sovereignty US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering
tonight It will be the first such event since the Madrid
conference Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks
Edward Djerejian said that tonights gathering is meant to
demonstrate the US active role in the peace process
 
I hope I hope that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues
and concerns related to this peace process We have differing opinions
certainly on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope
that resolution of the tensions and conflict will happen

As we run to the defense of our side there is no need to constantly 
involve ourselves in namecalling All of us are regularly confused by
the others reactive posting because they spend most of the post
applying labels and presenting slogans than in just presenting their
honest views Thenwhen we react we do the same thing


Do you as I do agree that this sort of peace process is needed
What about the particular points mentioned in the article Is what
Israel is supposedly going to propose good Does it go too far
Not far enough

If you dont agree that a peace process is needed what is
