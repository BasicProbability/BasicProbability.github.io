Subject Re Freedom In USA


 
 Bull shit There is no reason in the world why we cant say that
 taking views analogous to the KKKs or some such organization is
 wrong There is no reason why some morality may not be legislated As
 it is we do not allow theft or murder or rape Why should we allow
 hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence
 
 Harry
 	Actually Youre wrong as well The KKK is allowed to
march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected
Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year 
	Morality should not be legilated in a free country like
the US 
	Ill post something on TJ and Uva under Uva for those
Hoos bashers
