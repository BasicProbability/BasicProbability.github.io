 	A few things about the University It is more fun than some may
 admit Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked
 one of Playboys top party schools But we do study and more
 importantly learn a lot The overall UVa drug use is actually
 lower than the average college in the US 
 	There is no hate law on the books even though they The
 forces of PC tried to have one last year by the way a similar
 law at the University of Wisconsin  was found unconstitutional
 last year There is a law
 against relationship of professors with their students or
 advisees that just passed 
 	Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia
 statute for religious freedomthe basis for the first ten
 amendments though he is not given full credit for righting
                                                      
 the bill of rights So someone who picked on me for that is
 right 
 	By the way were the man in everything Sports
 academics and partying Im sure a lot of other schools are
 good at what they do as well so dont start mailing me junk
 Im happy where I am and maybe Ill go to one of yalls medical
 schools in a couple of years
	Oh my god My spelling and grammer suck I guess I need some
sleep I said righting instead of writing Whats the chance
of that Thank god I caught it before everyone started picking
on it I hope I didnt cause MrJefferson too much shame
