Well over 100000 in Lebanon alone
1000000  2000000 in the IranIraq conflict even if Iranians
arent Arabs strictly speaking  They seem to hate the Zionists at
least as much as anyone else in the neighborhood  Is there some
correlation perhaps between hating Israel and killing off your own
people


Perhaps Iranians are not Arabs even notsostrictlyspeaking
