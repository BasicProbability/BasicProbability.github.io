    Bull shit There is no reason in the world why we cant say that
    taking views analogous to the KKKs or some such organization is
    wrong There is no reason why some morality may not be legislated As
    it is we do not allow theft or murder or rape Why should we allow
    hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence

	   Actually Youre wrong as well The KKK is allowed to
   march and any attempts to curtail their freedom is rejected
   Actually I believe the ACLU won a case for them last year 
	   Morality should not be legilated in a free country like
   the US 

Yes That seems to be the problem Even Germany now has laws for its
military where soldiers are required to disobey orders if they
believe the orders are morally incorrect

Naziism is prohibited in Canada Germany others How pray tell is
Canda any less free than the US

	   Ill post something on TJ and Uva under Uva for those
   Hoos bashers
