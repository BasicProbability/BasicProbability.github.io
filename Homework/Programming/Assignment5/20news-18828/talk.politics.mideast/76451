	The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since
no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the
lebenese border No trials no hearing just expulsion based on
guilt due to race 

Not due to race  Due to membership in an organization which
publically proclaimed it would destroy the state which expelled them
 and furthermore kill a large segment of the citizens of that state
based on race
