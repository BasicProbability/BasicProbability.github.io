	A few things about the University 

Why There is no need to go into this

It is more fun than some may
admit Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked
one of Playboys top party schools 

especially this rivetting piece of information

But we do study and more
importantly learn a lot The overall UVa drug use is actually
lower than the average college in the US 
	There is no hate law on the books even though they The
forces of PC tried to have one last year by the way a similar
law at the University of Wisconsin  was found unconstitutional
last year 

As I remember someone did ask if UV had a speach code But really
there is no need for this brief survey course 

There is a law against relationship of professors with their students 
or advisees that just passed
 
	Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia
statute for religious freedomthe basis for the first ten
amendments though he is not given full credit for righting
the bill of rights So someone who picked on me for that is
right 
	By the way were the man in everything Sports
academics and partying 

How wonderful for you

Im sure a lot of other schools are
good at what they do as well so dont start mailing me junk
Im happy where I am and maybe Ill go to one of yalls medical
schools in a couple of years
