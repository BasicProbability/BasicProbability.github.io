  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism 

You obviously havent read his postings clearly

The only
ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
are the Israelophiles  

Israelophiles  Is this anything like Israelists  Youre treading on
thin ice here

You all are an insult to you race

Now youre falling through the ice  Barfie  We have a playmate for
you 

	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 1930s and 1940s  The Hirgun and other branch 
off militant groups did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs  

There is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism
The former primarily targets enemy soldiers  The latter primarily
targets civilians and not necessarily enemy civilans at that

These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers 

Innocent British soldiers  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers
THe British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become
the recognized Jewish homeland  The British  to their eternal shame
and damnation  were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees civilians
back to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler

By comparison Palestinean fighters primarily target tourists
schoolchildren babies worshippers shoppers moviegoers and other
such threatening people  Early Zionist fighters did no such things

Your comparison is ignorant and odious

	I mention this not because Im anti semitic Im part
Jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the
Israelites pisses me off so  

Does it bug you that the Israelites they used to be
Israelophiles happen to be right

Im not as critical of the
Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
Jews  

Are you kidding  Palestinean Arabs  who comprise a tiny proportion 
of the worlds refugee population who have almost no justifiable
claim to the territory that they desire who have acted as criminals
in the international community for decades  are being treated like
the most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence even after
their ignominious support for Saddam in Desert Storm  How many other
world leaders have addressed the UN with a machinegun in hand
receiving a standing ovation

It s a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
German and European anti semitism

You are now parrotting some of the weakest arguments of the
terrorists apologists  Congratulations
