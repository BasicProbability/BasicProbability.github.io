Tell them to stay home  Sorry terrible attempt at homour there

Alternative Hell I dont know Butits perfectly possible to have
objections to a particular policy while feeling that there is no 
alternative choice

Sealing off the Gaza Strip has the interesting sideeffect of
demonstrating the nonviability of Gaza as an independent state
Where are all of these people going to go to find work if they are
separated from Israel  If they complain about having to show id cards
on the way to work how will they feel about showing passports on the
way to work

Throughout the years of the IsraelArabPalestinian conflict the internal
Palestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the
lower tiers of the economy Given the major kinds of positions required
by the Israeli and the Palestinian economy there are essentially two
different ones existing side by side arent holding down many of the 
skilled positions So when Gaza has to operate on its own there are 
few residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management
