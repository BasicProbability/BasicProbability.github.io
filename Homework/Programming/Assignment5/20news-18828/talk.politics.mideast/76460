Subject Re Final Solution for Gaza 


There are basically three alternatives for Gaza

1  To throw the Jews to the sea that is basically to make them leave
   the MiddleEast and go back to where they came from russia Europe USA etc
2  To throw the Gazans into the sea in accordance with Yitzhak Rabins
     wish and that of many Zionists
3  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair I
   dont attempt to say just settlement which would allow each person
   to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality

I personnaly opt for the third alternative How about you folks
