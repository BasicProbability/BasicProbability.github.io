Subject Re Final Solution for Gaza 

In article 1483500366igcapcorg Center for Policy Research cprigcapcorg writes

There are basically three alternatives for Gaza

4 Annex Gaza to Egypt
5 Annex Gaza to Israel
6 Maintain the status quo
7 Partition Gaza into a Jewish and an Arab state

	I dont necisarily support any of these I just felt like
pointing out there are way more than three solutions  Next time
maybe well see some research into them
