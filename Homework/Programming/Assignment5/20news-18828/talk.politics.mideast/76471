organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda  Furthermore
you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing 
to the WTC bombing in which ArabAmericans had no involvement

	Huh  Mohamed Salimeh was perhaps a Korean  How do you claim
arabamericans had no involvement in the WTC bombing

	Ok his involvement is alleged by the FBI which doesnt seem
to reliable these days  But honestly there is a pile of evidence
pointing to them and it seems those 5 were involved

	This does not mean that all arabamericans were involved nor
should they be blamed for it but denying that there were some
arabamericans involved sounds sorta silly to me
