 	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its
 gross violation of human rights
 
 	The UN has also failed to condemn gross violations of human
 rights in many other places around the globe and in the middle east
 thus leading many people to conclude that the UN is biased in whom in
 chooses to condemn
 
 	A short incomplete list of things the UN didnt even consider
 condemning

	Wow if you were the only source of news around the
world it would seem that Israel is being treated unfairly

	Ok you dont like what I have to say  Would you care to
demonstrate how the above list or any expanded version of it you
chose to post demonstrates fairness in the actions of the UN wrt
Israel

luckily that is not the case I suggest reading european
papers rather than Israeli propaganda Arab papers wouldnt
hurt either to see the propaganda of the other side

	You make the odd assumption that I read Israeli papers not
European ones  My main source of news is the Economist a London
based magazine

	Also I do on rare occaisons read Arab papers but its hard
to find English language papers from Arab countries here

 Anyway
you are an example of what happens when people chose what to
read Dont get me wrong it is perfectly within your rights
Just dont go off acting like youre objective

	Have I ever claimed to be objective  I pointed out with a 27
item list that Israel is condemned for actions that other nations are
not condemned for  You go off and attack me for reading only Israeli
newspapers

	If youd like to debate this please do  If youd like to
make ad hominum attacks feel free to do that too  But try not to
mask one as another
