  	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its
  gross violation of human rights
  
  	The UN has also failed to condemn gross violations of human
  rights in many other places around the globe and in the middle east
  thus leading many people to conclude that the UN is biased in whom in
  chooses to condemn

  condemning

 	Wow if you were the only source of news around the
 world it would seem that Israel is being treated unfairly
 luckily that is not the case I suggest reading european
 papers rather than Israeli propaganda Arab papers wouldnt
 hurt either to see the propaganda of the other side Anyway
 you are an example of what happens when people chose what to
 read Dont get me wrong it is perfectly within your rights
 Just dont go off acting like youre objective
 
 Im unclear here Are you saying that these events DID NOT occurr
 As you know the UN neither condemned nor expressed outrage at any
 of the events listed I retained those that reflected policies
 of murder and abuse Is that an irrelevent fact to you
 
 While I do expect Israels abusive policies to be condemned
 where appropriate are you saying that you do not notice any
 degree of selective morality on the UNs part Do you also
 find it convenient and easy to blithely ignor particular abhorrant
 acts simply because the perpetrators dont happen to be on your
 bad guys list

	I have to say I think this is the first time there has
been something posted that opposed me without making personal
insults Congradulations tim I think the other people answered
you on most of the factual partsesp about the internal
conflicts policy 
	Israel very often gets away with more
than most other nations Due to US vetos While I am not
familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi
Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the
pilgrims were iranian Yes the UN is biased but mostly in
favor of the US and its allies Including Israel Saudi Arabia
and Pakistan and against Outlaw countries like iran and more
recently Iraq Far be it from me to support the repressive
governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel
for things they do wrong Again the reason some condemnations
dont occur lies in the race or country of the victims The
gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and
since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation
resulted The palestinians killed by arab countries involved
another case of who cares It seems that until very recently no
one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere including
in Israel and the occupied territories
	Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults
