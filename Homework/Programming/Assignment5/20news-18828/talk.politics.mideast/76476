Subject Stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Great Wall of China

In the following report Turkey Eyes Regional Role ANKARA Turkey AP
April 27 1993 we find in the last paragraph

Turanist Although Premier Suleyman Demirel criticized Ozals often
Turanist brash calls for more Turkish influence he also has spoken
Turanist of a swath of Turkic peoples stretching from the Adriatic
Turanist Sea to the Great Wall of China

Who does Demirel think he is fooling It seems at both ends of his envisioned 
panTurkic Empire  the Balkans and the Caucasus  Turkeys fascist boasts
are being preempted

I would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their Grey Wolf Teeth and
attempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China Turkey will have cried wolf
just once too much
