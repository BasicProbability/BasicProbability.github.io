Subject About this Center for Policy Research


   I have read numerous posts over a period of several months by
this antiIsrael fanatic hiding in the shadow of the respectable
sounding name of the Center for Policy Research  Obviously it
is no research center of any kind unless researching published
documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so  

   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising
in itself  That is simply part of the propaganda process  I was
curious if anyone knew who this antiIsrael fanatic hiding behind
his phoney research center name is  Is he an Arab  Is he some
typical antisemite hiding behind a veneer of antizionism  Is
he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldnt make it
there and is now taking his failure out on Israel  

   Lets shed some light on this clown once and for all  It will
help put his nonsense in the proper perspective  And the readers
of this group who are more interested in fact than in antiIsrael
hyperbola can ignore this junk
