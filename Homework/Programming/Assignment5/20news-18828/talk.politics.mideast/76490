A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson

The following proposal is based on the following assumptions

1      Fundamental human rights such as the right to life to
education to establish a family and have children to human
dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc are
more important to human existence that the rights of states

2      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail

3      Between the collectivities defining themselves as
JewishIsraeli and PalestinianArab however labelled an
unresolved conflict exists

4      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of
people It moreover poisons relations between communities peoples
and nations

5      Each year the United States expends billions of dollars
in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties

6      Attempts to solve the IsraeliArab conflict by traditional
political means have failed

7      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two
distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the
land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible

8      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake
of peace and justice When people love they share

Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal

1      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
and the other PalestinianArab

2      To be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove
that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli
citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner
although born in areas under current Isreali control is not
entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return

3      For the first child the grant will amount to 18000 For
the second the third child 12000 for each child For each
subsequent child the grant will amount to 6000 for each child


4      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which
have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the
IsraeliArab conflict including the US Government Jewish and
Christian organizations in the US  and a great number of
governments and international organizations

5      The emergence of a considerable number of mixed
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society The existence of a strong mixed stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the
MiddleEast in a graceful manner

Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced I will
attempt to identify some of these

1      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected
forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional However
it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is
recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the
perverse effects of segregation and discrimination International
law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at
reducing racial discrimination and segregation

2      It may be objected that the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it is
a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous
colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed
struggle This objection is based on the assumption that the
enemy is not Zionism as ideology and practice but
IsraeliJewish society and its members which will have to be
defeated This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill
the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental
human rights over collective rights see above

3      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of
financial incentives to encourage mixed marriages From their
point of view the continued existence of a specific Jewish People
overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of
human rights  The President of the World Jewish Congress Edgar
Bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he
gave to Der Spiegel a German magazine He called the increasing
assimilation of Jews in the world a calamity comparable in its
effects only with the Holocaust This objection has no merit
either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see
above

4      It may objected that only a few people in
IsraelPalestine would request such grants and that it would thus
not serve its purpose To this objection one might respond that
although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect
of such a proposal the existence of such a Fund would help mixed
couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and
encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist
attitudes

5      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to
bring about substantial demographic changes This objection has
merits However it must be remembered that huge sums more than
3 billion are expended each year by the United States government
and by US organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the
MiddleEast through armaments A mere fraction of these sums would
suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable
climate towards the existence of mixed marriages in
IsraelPalestine thus encouraging the emergence of a
nonsegregated society in that worntorn land

I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as
well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful
discussion and enrichment
