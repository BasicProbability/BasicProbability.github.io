  It is NOT a terrorist camp as you and the Israelis like 
  to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
  in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc
  SOME young men usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
  the Lebanese resistance  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
  know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
  suspect who they are and what they are up to  These young men are
  supported financially by Iran most of the time  They sneak arms and
  ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
  for Israeli patrols  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
  by these traps Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
  of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians  
  
  This a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups
  to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the
  opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or
  in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search Certainly the
  people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the
  innocent civilians into harms way
  
  Are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover Israel
  should totally back down Sothe easiest way to get away with attacking
  another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
  innocent lives
 
 Tell me Tim what are these guerillas doing wrong Assuming that they are using
 civilians for cover are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country If the
 buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel is it not working Why is it 
 further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages Why not just
 kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone You see there is more to
 the shelling of the villages it is called RETALIATION GETTING BACK
 GETTING EVEN It doesnt make sense to shell the villages The least
 it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of
 civilians

  Please clarify your standards for rules of engagement  As I
  understand it Israelis are at all times and under all
  circumstances fair targets  Their opponents are legitimate
  targets only when Mirandized or some such

  Im sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant apriori
  that Israelis are the Black Hats and that therefore killing
  them is automatically a Good Thing Go Hezbollah  The
  corollary is that the Hezbollah are the White Hats and that
  whatever they do is a Good Thing and the Israelis only prove
  themselves to be Bad Guys by attacking them

  This sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan I know who cheers
  when one of the players on His Team uses his stick to permanently
  rearrange an opponents face and curses the ref for penalizing
  His Side  Of course when its different when the roles are
  reversed
