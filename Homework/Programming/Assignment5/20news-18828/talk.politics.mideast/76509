    Q How many occupying israeli soldiers terrorists does it
       take to kill a 5 year old native child
   
    A Four
   
    Two fasten his arms one shoots in the face
    and one writes up a false report
   
    

Can Nick Steel provide documentation for this alleged incident 

Probably nothes just singing someone elses opera Hes good too perhaps he should get The Best Supporting Singer

I can give you a QA account that is well documented just go back and reread some of the articles that appeared after this joke

Q How many antisemites does it take to come up with another antiIsraeli
   provocation on the net

A Just one Hell fabricate a lie and many more will applaud

I would much prefer if Mr Steel would refrain from this kind of jokes in the 
future Theyre not just offensive They also have a very negative effect on 
the state of things between Jews and Arabs So thanks for nothing clown
