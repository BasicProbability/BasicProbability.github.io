A unconventional proposal for peace in the MiddleEast
 by
			  Elias Davidsson

Of all the stupid postings youve brought here recently it is
illuminating that you chose to put your own name on perhaps the
stupidest of them

The following proposal is based on the following assumptions

1      Fundamental human rights such as the right to life to
education to establish a family and have children to human
dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc are
more important to human existence that the rights of states

Does this mean that you are calling for the dismantling of the Arab
states 

2      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail

Apparently your answer is yes

6      Attempts to solve the IsraeliArab conflict by traditional
political means have failed

Attempts to solve these problem by traditional military means and
nontraditional terrorist means has also failed  But that wont stop
them from trying again  After all it IS a Holy War you know 

7      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two
distinct ethnicalreligious communitiespeoples which claim the
land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible

No just solution possible  How very encouraging

Having stated my assumptions I will now state my proposal

You mean that it gets even funnier

1      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is IsraeliJew
and the other PalestinianArab

3      For the first child the grant will amount to 18000 For
the second the third child 12000 for each child For each
subsequent child the grant will amount to 6000 for each child

4      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which
have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the
IsraeliArab conflict 

No the Fund should be financed by the Center for Policy Research  It
IS a major organization isnt it  Isnt it

5      The emergence of a considerable number of mixed
marriages in IsraelPalestine all of whom would have relatives on
both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society 

Yeah just like marriages among Arabs has strengthened their
societies 

The existence of a strong mixed stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the
MiddleEast in a graceful manner

The world could do with a bit less Middle Eastern grace

Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced I will
attempt to identify some of these

Boy youre a oneman band  Listen if youd like to Followup on your
own postings and debate with yourself just tell us and well leave
you alone
