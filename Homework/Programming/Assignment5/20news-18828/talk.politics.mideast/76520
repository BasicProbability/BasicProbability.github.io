 According to Exodus there were 600000 Jews that marched out of Egypt
 
 This is only the number of adult males  The total number of Jewish
 slaves leaving Egypt was much larger
 
 The number which could have arrived to the Holy Lands must have been
 substantially less ude to the harsh desert and the killings between the
 Jewish tribes on the way

 Typical Arabic thinking  If we are guilty of something so is
 everyone else  Unfortunately for you Nabil Jewish tribes are not
 nearly as susceptible to the fratricidal murdering that is still so
 common among Arabs in the Middle East  There were no  killings
 between the Jewish tribes on the way

I dont like this comment about Typical thinking You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideologicalreligious colors The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land Thats why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well
