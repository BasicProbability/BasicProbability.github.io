   Please clarify your standards for rules of engagement  As I

   targets only when Mirandized or some such
 
   Im sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant apriori
   that Israelis are the Black Hats and that therefore killing
   them is automatically a Good Thing Go Hezbollah  The
   corollary is that the Hezbollah are the White Hats and that
   whatever they do is a Good Thing and the Israelis only prove
   themselves to be Bad Guys by attacking them
 
   This sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan I know who cheers
   when one of the players on His Team uses his stick to permanently
   rearrange an opponents face and curses the ref for penalizing
   His Side  Of course when its different when the roles are
   reversed

Well you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli 
patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the retaliatory
shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israelibacked forces My team
you see was playing fair while the opposing team was rearranging the
faces of the spectators in my teams viewing stands so to speak 

I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda There are no a priori
black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in 
retaliation to pinpoint attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the
Lebanese terrorists
