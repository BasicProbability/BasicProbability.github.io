	The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their RIGHTS
        to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are INVADING their 
        territorium
	

	Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
	Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
	are their homeland Cant you see the
	the  Great Armenia dream in this With facist methods like
	killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the 
	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees trying to
	escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
	by the Armenians 


       However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane 
       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
       that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
       carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA


	Dont speak about things you dont know 8 American Cargo planes
	were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
	announced that they were going to search these cargo 
	planes 3 of these planes returned to its base in Germany
	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
	of the other 3 planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
	humanitarian aid

	Search Turkish planes You dont know what you are talking about
	Turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons
	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
	it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
	since its content is announced to be weapons
