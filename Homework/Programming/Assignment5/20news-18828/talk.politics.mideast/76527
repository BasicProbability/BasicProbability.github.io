henrik  The Armenians in NagarnoKarabagh are simply DEFENDING their 
henrik  RIGHTS to keep their homeland and it is the AZERIS that are 
henrik  INVADING their homeland


HE     Homeland First NagarnoKarabagh was Armenians homeland today
HE     Fizuli Lacin and several villages in Azerbadjan
HE     are their homeland Cant you see the
HE     the  Great Armenia dream in this With facist methods like
HE     killing raping and bombing villages The last move was the
HE     blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees trying to
HE     escape the from Lacin a city that was given to the Kurds
HE     by the Armenians

NagornoKarabakh is in Azerbaijan not Armenia Armenians have lived in Nagorno
Karabakh ever since there were Armenians Armenians used to live in the areas
between Armenia and NagornoKarabakh and this area is being used to invade 
Nagorno Karabakh Armenians are defending themselves If Azeris are dying
because of a policy of attacking Armenians then something is wrong with this 
policy

If I recall correctly it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land
in the first place not the Armenians

henrik  However I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane
henrik  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
henrik  that happened last SUMMER Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
henrik  carrying humanitarian aid bound to ARMENIA

HE     Dont speak about things you dont know 8 US Cargo planes
HE     were heading to Armenia When the Turkish authorities
HE     announced that they were going to search these cargo
HE     planes 3 of these planes returned to its base in Germany
HE     5 of these planes were searched in Turkey The content of
HE     of the other 3 planes Not hard to guess is it It was sure not
HE     humanitarian aid

What story are you talking about Planes from the US have been sending
aid into Armenian for two years I would not like to guess about what were in
the 3 planes in your story I would like to find out


HE     Search Turkish planes You dont know what you are talking about
HE     Turkeys government has announced that its giving weapons
HE     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
HE     it self not the Karabag province So why search a plane for weapons
HE     since its content is announced to be weapons

Its too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia
