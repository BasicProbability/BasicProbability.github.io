Why do you title this News you will miss 

There have been at least three frontpage stories on it in the LA Times

I wouldnt exactly call that a media coverup

This may come as a surprise to you but there are a few americans who do not
read the LA Times

Is this the same Monolithic Centrally Controlled Media that youre always
talking about Do you mean to tell me that the LA Times is the ONLY major
paper to buck the Media Spiking Divisions activities


The Defamation League has done a first class job of damage controlin what
little is left of the world outside of LA


Assumption When one major newspaper prints three or more articles on the front
page regarding subject matter that is not strictly local this is likely
to be considered an open story and not a coverup
 
Lets hear a roll call here Anyone outside of the LA area seen articles on
this
