 In the following report Turkey Eyes Regional Role ANKARA Turkey AP
 April 27 1993 we find in the last paragraph
 
 Turanist Although Premier Suleyman Demirel criticized Ozals often
 Turanist brash calls for more Turkish influence he also has spoken
 Turanist of a swath of Turkic peoples stretching from the Adriatic
 Turanist Sea to the Great Wall of China
 
 Who does Demirel think he is fooling It seems at both ends of his envisioned
 panTurkic Empire  the Balkans and the Caucasus  Turkeys fascist boasts
 are being preempted
 
 I would suggest Turkey let the world feel some of their Grey Wolf Teeth
and
 attempt to stretch from the Adriatic to China Turkey will have cried wolf
 just once too much 

Mentioning that Turkic people are widespread means desiring a Turkish empire
Is that the logical thing to conclude from a statement like that 
To me it just says that Turkey may have economical benefits from that
if she can be competitive enough No more than that But of course
you have the freedom of extrapolating as you wish from any statement

One question In what context did Ozal use the words you are quoting
Can you give the whole speech
