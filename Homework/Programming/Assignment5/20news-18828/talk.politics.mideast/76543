In article C65tso4zAbony1bonycom jakebony1bonycom Jake Livni writes
   There is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism
   The former primarily targets enemy soldiers  The latter primarily
   targets civilians and not necessarily enemy civilans at that


   By comparison Palestinean fighters primarily target tourists
   schoolchildren babies worshippers shoppers moviegoers and other
   such threatening people  Early Zionist fighters did no such things

This is historically incorrect  Early Zionist fighters did indeed
target civilians  They made random attacks in Arab marketplaces
killing innocent passersby  Your assertion of the opposite is an
attempt to whitewash history  Anyone can read about the history of
the Zionist terrorists  A good book to start is the one by J Bowyer
Bell an expert in international terrorism  His main interest is
Irish terrorism

For completeness Arab thuggery of the same period was also rampant
and targeted chiefly Jewish civilians  Can anyone tell me what the
opposite of live and let live is
