  Mr Mamayskys proposal to forbid any action which serves to promote a
      morally incorrect action omitted for brevity 

I prefer the freedom granted in the first amendment of the US
Constitution to an arbitrary definition of universal morality

Society is impossible without some shared set of moralities sense
of what is god and what is bad action and basic foundation of 
something universal
