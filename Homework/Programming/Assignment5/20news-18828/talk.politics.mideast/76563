   Assuming that you mean hear you werent listening he just
   told you Zionism is Racism  This is a tautological statement
 
 I think you are confusing tautological with false and misleading

  No but youre right that I didnt express myself well

  The dialog went

   A Zionism is racism
   B What IS zionism
  DC You werent listening were you

  In other words the first statement defined a Zionism of discourse
  Everything else was redundant
