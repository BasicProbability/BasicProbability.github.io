 organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda  Furthermore
 you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing 
 to the WTC bombing in which ArabAmericans had no involvement
 
 	Huh  Mohamed Salimeh was perhaps a Korean  How do you claim
 arabamericans had no involvement in the WTC bombing
 
 	Ok his involvement is alleged by the FBI which doesnt seem
 to reliable these days  But honestly there is a pile of evidence
 pointing to them and it seems those 5 were involved
 
 	This does not mean that all arabamericans were involved nor
 should they be blamed for it but denying that there were some
 arabamericans involved sounds sorta silly to me

I dont think any of the suspects were Americans Consequently they could
not be ArabAmericans
