 	The Jews that were stranded on the polish border since
 no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the
 lebenese border No trials no hearing just expulsion based on
 guilt due to race 
 
 Not due to race  Due to membership in an organization which
 publically proclaimed it would destroy the state which expelled them
  and furthermore kill a large segment of the citizens of that state
 based on race
 

	Actually thats only what the Israeli government
claims There were no trials held Which is a key thing in a
free country like the US
