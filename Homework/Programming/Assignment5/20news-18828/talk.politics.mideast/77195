I do not want to convince anyone This is just USENET not the real
world I just read the opinions others have about a subject and sometimes
I present my opinion I think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas I never wanted nor I want now to convince anyone of anything

Fine  Now if your opinion isnt convincing anyone and its getting
refuted regularly by the facts which is the case isnt it likely that
your opinions need some revision

As I said I do not want to convice anyone so why should my opinions
convince anyone
I do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts

Then you havent been paying attention to the arguments levelled against
them They have been over and over again  They will be again

First and I repeat it I never said that the idea of Jews having the
right to have a State is racist
Zionism as a movement is more than just that idea

In a word  utter and complete horse puckey  Look the term up in the
dictionary

Maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here One thing is the
accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary and sometimes a completely
different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time

Hey what do you think dictionaries are for  You quite obviously need
one  A good dictionary gives both and you well know it

 I think that Zionism
in the way it defines who is a Jew for example is racistlike

OK now how would YOU define it  And by the way youre wrong again
There is NO uniformity of this definition among Zionist movements
You know this is the case its been pointed out on the net directly to
you before and yet you continue to maintain this delusion

OK Tell me how many people in Zionist movements define a Jew in a 
different way and how many are who define Jew based on a religious way

I dont think that data exist on this directly

In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do
not support the bombing and killing of the IRA I believe that Jews have
a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now

Comparing the actions of Israel to that of the IRA is like comparing
those of the US to those of Chile under Pinochet for example with the
IRA in the role of Pinochet  You really need to get your history
straight  You also need a basic dictionary

You need to start reading before answering 
My point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic it 
does not mean that I consider it to be nationalistic I did not comapre
Israel to the IRA I think that you are starting to put words on my 
mouth and that is wrong

That is no problem  But once again you are defining Zionism as ONE
movement  You are implying that it is monolithic  You KNOW this is
not and has never been the case

Stuff deleted by Pinkas  His statement which I was responding to
with the below asserted that Zionism was uniform and monolithic

I never said that Zionism is monolithic If you are going to attribute
me things present the quotes where I said that

You dont say it directly  You implied it and I showed explicitly
where and how you implied it  Now youre trying to wriggle out of it
Wont wash and you know it

That is what makes the basis for Zionist movements However I am not 
considering just that but the rest of it 

In a word  I dont believe you  Your words tell a very different
story  Especially since they are not based on fact but innuendo and
misrepresentation 

That is your problem I could certainly interpret this like you are 
running out of arguments First you put words in my mouth now you
say you do ot believe me

Its you not me who is running out of arguments  

Which makes an interesting point People living in a Jewish State have
shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are
not the same So the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown 
us that there are some problems in a State where 80 of the people is secular
but Judaism is define according to religious standards or where marriage
is a religious stage or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to
a religious standard

No it doesnt  Nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be
religious or even believe in Gd to become a citizen of Israel
thereunder  

Why dont you try reading for a change Did I say that the Law of Return
demand a person to be religious Now how does the Law of Return define 
who is a Jew and who is not I said that it uses a religious standard
If your mother is a Jew you are a Jew if your mother is not Jewish
neither you are
Do not twist my words please

What you said is that Judaism is defined according to religious
standards  Now this can have several different meanings and you know
it  One of the meanings that it can have is to say that Only those who
are religious are defined as Jews  Another is to say that Only those
who meet the religious definition of a Jew is one  And there are
others  Im not twisting your words  Im trying to make you aware that
your words dont mean what you think they do

True there are debates in Israel and abroad about who is
a Jew but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular
Would you say that religious people should not have a say in that
Would you deny them their right of free speech

I am not talking about the debate I am talking about how things are right
now When the debate is over Ill see what happens
Right now things are like they are
Let me ask you one thing I understand that Israel differenciates between
Citizenship and Nationality Suppose Male and Female have a child in
Israel Which nationality will the childs ID show according to each one
of the following cases

Actually it doesnt  And the citizens rights are exactly THE SAME in
both cases anyway

a F and M are both Jewish

Jewish

b F is Jewsh and M is not

Jewish

c F is Muslim and M is jewish
d F is Christian and M is Jewish

Itll depend on what religion is practiced in the house  The original
law of return would still admit such a person if they were Jewish if
memory serves

e F and M are both nonJewish

Not Jewish


Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become 
nonJews Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a 
religious definition

Its called history  How do you think Jews stuck together through
pogroms for millenia in Europe  We had to know who was our own  I for
one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent
is no less legit than is matrilineal which is NOT the religious Jews
point of view  Theres plenty of room for that in Zionism  as you
well know

It called history At some point it was OK Now I believe it is not 

Thats valid as far as I can see

According to Websters Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary MerriamWebster Inc
Publishers Springfield Massachusetts USA 1986 page 593 

hypocrisy A feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not

So saying that one believes in Zionism as a simple matter of people 
having the right to nationalism but disregarding the right of the Palestinian
people to do the same according to this dictionary is hypocrisy

Utter baloney  By the way I do believe the Palestinians have a right
to selfdetermination have stated so on this net and I know youve
                                                        
seen it  
 

Interesting How do you know Had I ever talked to you about this and 
forgotten about that

More than once  As have others

But that right to selfdetermination cannot be at Israels
expense  Israels security comes first and that security must be
maintained  Youre also twisting words now beyond belief  If you think
thats what that definition means in this context you need a firstgrade 
course in English


Which definition are you now talking here about 

The very one you give above  It is absolutely inconsistent with the
twist you put on it  

I do not know why you are so touchy I never said that you did not support
Palestinian selfdetermination I just gave an example of hypocrisy

No you didnt  You had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees
in order to do so and everyone else knows it  Im not being touchy

 I never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it It was just an example Nothing
more nothing less than that Why did you have to clarify what you think

Because what you gave WAS NOT an example  IT WAS an example of how
the definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees  

If you didnt use different meanings of words than are in the
dictionary you might be believable  

Here you have several problems
First you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
the dictionary

Oh so now what are dictionaries for

Second it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more
words than those in the dictionary

Duh  As a scientist whose technical terms are very often not found in
common dictionaries I know this  But when a term is common like
hypocrisy a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source

Third we can exchange ideas if you want but you come out with this nonsense
about being believable  using the definitions given in a dictionary

Its not nonsense  When people read what you write they have to try to
associate a meaning to those words  Dictionaries give the meanings of
words dont they  Now I assume that youd like to have the words you
use mean what youd like them to  But the fact is youre using very
different meanings than are in the dictionary or you would like the
reader to assign them new meanings which they never had  

It seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
others Sad

Not at all  What I cannot abide is utter bombast when youve been
proven completely wrong

If your facts at all resembled
even the slightest bit of truth  which they do not  you might be 
believable  

If you did not put words in my mouth it might be that you might
start reading what I had actually said

I never put even one syllable in your mouth  You have tried to prove
this and you failed  

 So far you come over and over
twisting what I said or presenting things I never said as if I had said
them 

Poppycock

In this way you are answering to yourself That is why you do not
find it believable Maybe if you start reading what I had actually said
and not what you added you might change your mind

I read what you said  I did not add anything  You simply either dont
know that the words dont mean what youd like them to  which cannot be
the case now since youve been proven wrong and you quite obviously
dont have a defense against the arguments presented or youre twisting
the meanings  Which is it

But the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in
what youve said on this thread  And the fact also is that youre using
different definitions for your words  based on baloney  than anyone
else does

First there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what I said
as if I had said it 

Ha  Theres nothing resembling fact in what youve said  I NEVER added
ANYTHING to what you said
