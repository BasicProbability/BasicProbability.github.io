 If the Haitian peoples will is that their current Govt get thrown out 
 theyll find a way to do it Getting the USUN to shortcut the process will 
 only hasten it but sets a bad precedent  can the US interfere EVERYWHERE 
 Why not right at our doorstep  Cuba
 
 Precisely why not Cuba  Why not  The Hatians are being ruled by thugs 
 and their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples will  

Well lets delve one level deeper Why is democracy better than tribalism or
other means of Govt The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping
majority and booted out later w no objections from the UN Similarly the
people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the
junta declared it illegal In both cases I personally have no problems with
the outcome but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the 
world community claims to revere so why isnt it interfering there 

 the US or any other democracy wishes to they are in the perfect right to 
 help them without any whining from thir parties  After all if it turns out to 
 be colonialism and the poeple dont like it they find a way to throw them out

Exactly My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way and we can save
ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their
problems on their own Colonial interventions even in Haiti havent worked 
in the past They had a 102 coups from 18451915 The US invaded in 1915 And left
in 1933 almost 17 years after they had intended to Was it a success Well
look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself It was
a success so long as the US was in from what I remember But it didnt last
long obviously

 There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit
 in judgement of another people and to then act on it To me it is in there
 that the roots of old colonial attitudes lie Today the motives are noble
 Tomorrow they may not be
 
 Who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide 

Nobody did People should have a right to selfdefense If the UN wants to arm
the Bosnians or Haitian revolutionaries or whoever I have no problems with
that I do when they cross that line and attempt to rearrange boundaries govts
etc the VanceOwen plan being one such piece of insanity
 
 I want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide while you 
 want special sovereignties designed to protect them  Nobody has the right to 
 commit crimes against humanity and if they do they loose all right to self 
 determination  If this is classical colonialism then so be it

We finally have a clearlystated point of difference Colonialism can
have its good side which is as you stated above  removing thugs from being
able to lord it over powerless people I am worried that the bad side is what 
will assert itself and I am prepared to let natural forces take their course 
if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism
