Thats your opinion of course If we were to take your military
budget definition of Foreign Aid then the Foreign Aid we send
annually to Israel is easily multiplied beyond the three to six
depending on whose figures you believe million of hardearned US
taxpayers dollars

Oh really  Lets see  It costs the US Armed forces roughly 25K in
salaries for the average man or woman in uniform  Normally it takes 23
times the actual salary amount to support a worker  Thus for the
roughly 150K soldiers currently stationed in Germany we get nearly 4
billion dollars  more than the annual cost of ALL aid to Israel  in
personnel not even counting what is spent on local workers and
equipment

Youre just beginning to scratch the surface  Do you know how much
military equipment costs  When was the last time you tried to buy a
milspec hammer coffeepot or toilet seat  

Paying Israel to do the dirty work on its own without putting
American soldierss lives on the line is much much much cheaper than
Uncle Sams arrangements with much of the rest of the world
