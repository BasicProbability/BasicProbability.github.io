DEPOSITION OF KARINE BORISOVNA MELKUMIAN 1

Born 1963
Teacher
Boarding School No 1

Resident at Building 2B Apartment 21
Block 41A
Sumgait Azerbaijan

This is my fate I had everything we were a happy family and now at 25
Ive become a widow Im left to raise my three children alone the third not
yet two months old was born in Yerevan Igor and I had thought that if it was 
a girl we would call her Raisa after my motherinlaw and if it was a boy 
wed call him Arsen after Igors grandfather I had a girl and I without
Igor named her Raisa in honor of her dead grandmother

Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965 Igor and I grew 
up together we were friends from childhood on We got engaged when I was 16 
In 1981 when I was 18 we were married Two children were born to us in 
Sumgait My daughter is now 6 years old her name is Kristina and my son
Seryozha is four and a half

First I shall tell what happened on February 27 That day on my way home from 
work I passed Lenin Square where about 1500 people had gathered There were 
Komsomol members there and Pioneers Childrens organization and there were 
both Party members and nonParty people there as well All of them were 
shouting Theres no room for Christians here and When we finish with the 
Armenians well go after the Russians And some even cried Out Death to 
the Armenians Absurd rumors had been circulating about town I became 
frightened I came home breathless and told about everything I had seen 
downtown My family couldnt believe it My fatherinlaw Sogomon Markovich 
Melkumian wasnt home he was at an Azerbaijani wedding By eight oclock he 
returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was 
smashed with a rock He got out of the car but there was no one there Well I 
was telling him everything too and he said What is there no longer any
government That same day Igor said Papa something terrible is happening 
in the city And he said Well stay at home no one will drive us from our 
own home

The day passed On February 28 that was Sunday we didnt go out We called 
our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions and they all said the 
same thing Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an 
Armenian from the neighboring building Ira my brotherinlaws wife and I 
called the police theyre wrecking a car help We called and called and 
nonetheless they didnt come and they didnt do anything

On February 29 on Monday even though there were troops in the city we were 
afraid to go to work I called the school I had the keys to the classroom I 
told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys I wouldnt 
be coming in He agreed and even said Fine dont come in we understand 
whats going on in town dont come in

Before that on the 28th the Ambartsumian family came over They came to my 
fatherinlaw and said Uncle Sergey they broke our windows bad things are 
happening in town Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said With my own eyes I 
saw them chasing naked girls through the streets I dont know he said we 
should leave town Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we 
should go thinking wed go to our dacha We got a couple of bags together 
clothes food the bare essentials And then somewhere around 445 the 
building manager came by and said Uncle Sergey the situation in town is 
bad dont go out My father even opened up to him and said Maybe well 
drive to the dacha itll be safer there No he said itll be worse 
there youll be safer at home He said dont be afraid if something happens 
Ill send people to save you

After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our 
courtyard All of us were at home at the time Igor and I and our two 
children Ira and Edik and their daughter my sisterinlaw Ira and my 
motherand fatherinlaw And the Ambartsumian family there were three of 
them Uncle Misha Zhasmen and their daughter Marina Now when they started
breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us Go in that room
and close the door Close the door and calm the children so they wont hear
that theres anyone home The children started crying Suddenly Ira my 
brotherinlaws wife suggested Lets run out onto the balcony We  the
two daughtersinlaw and the children and Zhasmen and Marina  raced out
onto the balcony My sisterinlaw and my motherinlaw ran in and said 
Quick over to the other balcony or theyll kill you all We lived on the
second floor We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbors At
first we couldnt manage it The balcony looked onto the street At that time
people were coming home from work and many just stood there watching I 
pleaded and begged Please call someone have someone come I even started 
shouting Ill throw down the children Ill throw them down you catch them 
and take them somewhere so at least the children will survive Either they 
were afraid or    I dont know what They looked as though they were 
watching a movie Some of them started throwing stones at us Ill say it 
again these werent the bandits these were people from the other part of the 
building and from our entryway they were just regular people passersby A 
bus even stopped I remember a mans voice saying the Armenians were climbing
over to the other balcony Ira my sisterinlaw helped us get the children 
over there I was pregnant about seven months pregnant No it wasnt yet 
seven it was six and a half I climbed over too I think Zhasmen went first 
you know I just dont remember it all that well Zhasmen went first I think 
and Ediks wife Ira and I had the children and they were all screaming and 
crying My Kristina said Mamma dont throw us over the balcony were 
afraid Lilia was crying and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too Kristina 
didnt even want to climb over She shouted Im staying with Grandmother
Im staying with Grandma She loved her grandma more than she loved me And 
my motherinlaw shouted Oh no Kristinas still there shes still there 
save Kristina too Ira helped us climb over with Kristina coming last Ira 
helped us and went back inside

We started pounding on the neighbors balcony door I pounded with my fist 
Sevil open the door open it please She didnt open it No go away go 
anywhere go Im not opening the door She was our neighbor we were 
friends we never refused her anything ever And apparently she thought we 
were going to break the windows and she opened the door She opened it and 
said Karina Karina go away go anywhere just dont stay here theyll 
kill us too because of you I begged Please at least take the children 
well leave well go back No she said you have to leave Her sons ran 
in one had a knife Sevils brother hes around 18 shouted at us Get out 
of here leave Ill kill you with this knife I became terrified I took the 
children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs I went down 
and heard a loudspeaker It was in the courtyard The Armenians must be 
killed theyve taken all the best places all the best apartments One of 
them said Let the Armenian blood flow none of them should survive When I 
heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors No one opened their 
door for me Not on the third floor or the fourth I couldnt see Zhasmen any 
longer Ira came upstairs later I even thought that they had let her stay 
that they would save her

My head was spinning They were killing my family and here I was in the next 
entryway with two children Seryozha was four and Kristina was five and a 
half They were crying Mamma were scared They were so frightened that I 
didnt even know how to calm them should I try to calm them or myself It was 
awful But on the third floor a man did open his door I asked Open up let 
me inside He opened the door slightly and said No No and that was it 
He said it so sternly No I went up to the fifth floor I pounded my fists 
on the door with all my might He opened up the man of the house and stood 
there looking at me I was ready to get down on my knees I almost did get 
down on my knees Please I beg of you at least take the children He 
wasnt an Azerbaijani he was a Lezgin I dont even know how but he let me 
inside And when I went in Zhasmen was already there Two minutes hadnt 
passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs Lilia was crying He didnt want 
to open the door And again I started pleading Please open the door its 
our Ira and Lilia Open the door And he said No Im afraid I said again 
and again Please open the door please He looked at me He looked at me 
for a long time and then opened the door after all Ira came in with Lilia We 
threw ourselves into each others arms crying Then the man locked us into 
the bathroom We sat there for a long time Through the door he told us Calm 
the children and calm yourselves down too

Calm down This man was hiding us but what of our family When I was still in 
our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive I 
said Igor Edik lets say farewell And Edik turned around and looked at 
me as if to say is that some kind of joke All the same I thought they would 
kill all of us Igor looked at me too    But it was already too late They 
started pounding on the door Igor was standing next to the door Before that 
he had told us Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight He thought we 
were in the room But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them 
Edik Igor lets say farewell Igor didnt think we could climb over to the 
other balcony And we did get over there and I myself cant believe we were 
able to save ourselves

Igor put on a helmet and Edik had his coat on and he put on a fur hat All 
the menIgor Edik their father and Misha Ambartsumianthey all stood next 
to the door They thought they would pound on it a while and leave But from 
the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani Open the door We 
were all silent waiting Someone outside the door said Theyre home
theyre in there break down the door And I remember my fatherinlaw 
whispering Theyre going to break it down now its coming down now    

He had something in his hands I think it was a knife if they got in we were 
going to defend ourselves In the hall near the door there were two metal 
chair legs From outside the door they said Were counting to five open 
up But we were all quiet we didnt answer them We made like no one was 
home We figured theyd leave theyd get tired and leave My fatherinlaw 
had said Its not possible theyd come into my home How can that be 
Everyone knows us all of Sumgait knows our family we are on good terms with 
everyone And indeed a day did not pass that there wasnt an Azerbaijani 
guest at our table We had a nice dacha everyone would get together there 
often Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too But now we had to save 
ourselves we had to flee from our own home Ira I remember said Im not 
leaving here my brothers and my parents are here Im going to fight 
alongside them Thats just what she said She picked up a knife and said 
If they open the door and come into the apartment then Im going to fight 
alongside my family Im not going anywhere

We were at Sevils when they broke into our apartment We heard fighting and 
shouting The noise was terrible And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor 
at the Lezgins apartment you could hear everything up there too Even Iras 
voice I remember her calling her mother several times She called her for a 
long time    I started pounding on the door in the bathroom Open the 
door what are they doing to Ira whos shouting thats Ira shouting thats 
her voice But the Lezgin said Its nothing calm down no its not in 
your apartment He was lying to me so Id calm down Two hours went by and 
the Lezgin opened the door and said Karina Igor got away calm down He ran 
away He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes They killed him 
outside next to the building

While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror The 
way Ira shouted She shouted Save me Mamma save me    Mamma Mamma 
She repeated it several times There was a wild din There were very many 
people there all of them shouting all of them bellowing howling 
whistlingyou just cant imagine what was going on what the roar was like

Apparently after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway 
where we were hiding and came upstairs all the way up to the fifth floor I 
dont know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in
particular but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed 
over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughtersinlaw 
were climbing over the balconies And after we heard Ira we heard them coming 
up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors I thought those were 
our last moments and started saying goodbye to my children kissing them 
They were sleeping I woke them up Kristina Seryozha wake up And I tell 
Ira Ira if something happens well throw ourselves off the balcony We 
were on the fifth floor Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door 
too because later he said I opened the door and told them there were no 
Armenians inside And after they all left our neighbor went out on the 
balcony himself to see they were gone

We werent friends with those Lezgin neighbors we only knew each other from 
the building But the people we were friends with wouldnt even consider 
hiding us

The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom They had a candle burning He said 
Karina therere no lights on in our block The whole block was dark the 
whole block Its a huge block too The Lezgin said Im afraid to keep
you until morning Im afraid of the neighbors they might kill me for saving
you I said What are you saying well leave now But we cant just leave
with the children in the middle of the night Give us time to find somewhere
else to hide He said Well OK go look I asked Ira Ira do you want to
go Ira said No Ill stay with the children Karina I said Fine then
Ill go Zhasmen and I went downstairs together It was very dark No one 
was in the courtyard It was dark pitch black l was afraid to go out at 
after seven Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home I never 
went out alone And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a
slaughter like that too It was probably after eleven Later I called the 
boarding school and my director answered He said Karina where are you I
didnt know I was calling from a public phone outside and didnt know where I 
was I got confused and hung up the receiver From him I only found out what 
time it was I asked him What time is it He said 1120 I think but I 
dont really remember So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard I 
look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment And there
was the smell of something burnt I became horrified I looked at the corpse 
for a long time It was either Ira or Edik I only saw one of them Zhasmen 
grabbed my hand and squeezed it Hurry up lets go    Hurry up come on 
what are you turning around for I turned around and saw a large truck it 
must have belonged to the bandits because they came to kill us in a truck 
like that We lived in the third entryway and that truck was next to the 
fourth We walked quickly holding hands I thought if I go to the police 
then theyll put me away I couldnt count on them Before I reached the 
police station I saw a military vehicle We went over and I said Soldier in 
Block 41 I dont know if theyve killed people or injured themwe need to 
save them And he said Go to the police station and tell them everything 
I said Im afraid to go there Im afraid of them He said Dont be 
afraid

We went to the police and they wrote down the address and the military 
vehicle went to our building I didnt go with them they left me at the 
police station I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that 
theyd rescue them too I didnt know where they were or what had happened to
them

After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia First they took us 
to the KGB that was at two or three in the morning Then around five they 
took us to the City Party Committee and there were very many people there 
very many I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress Seryozha was 
only wearing a shirt and Kristina had a little dress on No coat no boots 
nothing And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee

The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped And I thought that he was probably 
alive But then after two and a half days they took us the Armenians of 
Sumgait to Nasosny On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came 
and told us Karina Ira we need you come with us to the City Party 
Committee My Mamma had come to Nasosny and she had been looking for me for 
six days Mama my brothers and my uncle We went to the City Party Committee 
and waited there in the courtyard I was wearing nothing but a dress and Ira 
had only a dress on as well There was a strong wind on March 6 An hour went 
by And then one of the functionaries told us Karina Ira gather your 
courage Would you like to go to the burial I said What did they really 
kill all of them He said Lets look He had a long list and he started 
reading them off Igor Melkumian my husband Eduard Melkumian my brotherin
law Irina Melkumian my sisterinlaw Sogomon Melkumian my fatherinlaw
and Raisa Melkumian my motherinlaw He read off all their names and said 
Get in the car lets go to the burial

We buried our family I couldnt believe it at the time I couldnt conceive
of it or imagine it    And even now I think how shall I explain it to my 
children when theyre older

My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and
grandmother Kristina didnt love me the way she loved her grandfather and
grandmother they spoiled her Kristina would always announce My grandma is 
better than anyone Now even though she is getting used to my mother its 
difficult for her and once she told her Youre a bad grandmother

I dont know why I asked her Kristina wheres Papa and she said They 
killed him She knows she understands it all And recently I scolded
Seryozha severely for something and he started shouting at me When Papa 
comes Im going to tell him everything
