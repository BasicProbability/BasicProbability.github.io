    I am not aware of any such incidents

  Ive read most of the history books dealing with this period
  good and bad and while it is possible that I missed one or two
  none of those Ive read documents any razing of mosques So I
  think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation
 
 For the forgetful newcomers here are the references
 
 The reference I based my posting on originally is the book The West
 Bank Story by Rafik Halabi New York Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
 1982  Original title Die Westbank Story 
 
 Quoting from The West Bank Story pages 3536
 On the night of June 10 an Israeli officer marched from door to door
 through the Moghrabi Quarter of East Jerusalem giving the residents
 three hours notice to evacuate their homes 
 
  The participants in a
 July 24 1967 meeting of a group of Arab relgious and political
 figures protested the immodest dress of Israelis visiting the mosques
 and the destruction of two mosques in the Moghrabi Quarter adjacent to
 the Western Wall
 
 This issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
 just one reference probably wont resolve this issue to those that
 oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed Even in your
 location of this one reference you spend most of your quote dealing
 with an incidence that while abhorrant has nothing to do with the 
 issue at hand here Then at the end of the quote there is an almost
 offhand comment that two mosques were destroyed

  Tim youre missing the big sleightofhand here  I can accept every
  word quoted from Halabi and still have ZERO evidence of any mosques
  being razed  Note that what Halabi refers to is not that mosques
  were razed but that people PROTESTED alleged razing  Too well we
  know that this is a common demagogic tactic or has anyone forgotten
  the Temple Mount riots when the Moslem crowd was led to believe
  that the Israeli Guards were there to cover for the TMF instead of
  stop them
