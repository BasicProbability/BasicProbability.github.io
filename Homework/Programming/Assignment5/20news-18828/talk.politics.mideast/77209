Subject PLEASE SHOW UP IN WASHINGTON DC FOR BOSNIA MAY 15th


I appeal to to all of you to show up in Washington DC this saturday to
participate in a peaceful demonstration for the sake of humanity This is a 
critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things
will not change there in Bosnia Rapeskillingsethnic cleansing will
go on as a norm in the days to follow The UN will get to the towns after the fall
of thousands of inocent civilians like in Zapa just the past weekend It happened
to the Jews in 1940s its happening to the muslims today and who will be the next
victim

Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue time has come for US to
take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity Time is now and
this is for real folks the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe
that Clintons Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained
public pressure I just called Democaratic Sen John Kerrys office and they are saying that 
he the senator is waiting for president to take a decision means that he will wait and 
join the bandwagon later if it ever moves 

Please dont rely on others to take part in this demonstration You as an individual
will make a big difference Bring your families too not only you will help a great
cause but also it will be fun for all I know of several families from Massachusetts
who are travelling friday night to participate there Contact the local Islamic center
or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by prearranged busses The best option 
for students is to rentacar and carpool Please spread the word around
