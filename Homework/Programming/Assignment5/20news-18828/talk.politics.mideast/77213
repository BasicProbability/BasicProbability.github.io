Labours enclaves policy in the occupied territories

by Israel Shahak
publ in Middle East International London 30493

It is not difficult to discover Israels policy towards the 
Palestinians at any given time It can be easily inferred 
from the facts on the ground and from the information 
provided by the Hebrew press There is one condition 
though The torrents of claptrap about the peace 
process must be totally ignored as must Israels official 
pronouncements whole sole purpose is to distort reality 
By concentrating only on the facts it was early apparent 
that Labours policies were no different from those of 
Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their 
more effective implementation

Likuds policies were accurately described by Ariel 
Sharon in an article accompanied by a map in Yediot 
Aharonot last August The Sharon plan envisaged a 
division of the West Bank into seven and the Gaza Strip 
into four autonomous Palestinian enclaves all of them 
under Israeli supervision The total area of these 
enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the 
territories The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli 
settlements and the highways built around the enclaves 
The entire area around Jerusalem from the outskirts of 
Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem has already 
been turned into a Greater Jerusalem where the Arab
inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded 
by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for 
them

Judging from Labours settlement policy it may be 
assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number 
of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had 
planned But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by 
settlements strategically dispersed along the highways 
remains unchanged Labour plans only four enclaves in 
the West Bank two in Samaria and two in Judea ie 
north and south of Jerusalem respectively and no more 
than two in the Gaza Strip In regard to Greater 
Jerusalem Labours policies hardly deviate from 
Sharons

A saner version of Likud policy

As some Israeli correspondents at once realised Labour 
policies were but a saner version of Sharons 
extravaganza Last July Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot 
Aharonot that while barely a few months ago Labour 
supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond 
the Green Line no specific decision to freeze 
construction in the territories has been taken And Uzi 
Benziman wrote in Haaretz that as far as can be judged 
on the basis of the internal political discussions in 
Jerusalem Rabin intends to stick to Likuds ways

The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are 
located in Samaria Therefore the belt of settlements 
around the TransSamaria Highway designed to 
separate those enclaves from each other is of paramount 
importance According to the latest data the percentage 
of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population 
apart from East Jerusalem is a mere 55 per cent But 
for the area around the TransSamaria Highway the 
corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent and it is 
increasing steadily The situation in the settlements of 
the Efrat Block south of Jerusalem designed to sever 
the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around 
Hebron is pretty much the same The Efrat Block is now 
being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway

The project is costly in the extreme because the highway 
is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long 
tunnels The final decision to build this highway was 
suspended until Rabins return from his US visit in 
March The subsequent decision to renew its construction 
can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a 
whole

Process of impoverishment

The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady 
impoverishment of the Palestinians This is well known 
in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be 
concerned including the PLO In regard to the Gaza Strip 
the whole process was best described by Zeev Shiff in 
Haaretz in March He mentions having seen a pamphlet 
issued six years ago by the Civil Administration 
forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli 
rule in 2000 His analysis deserves to be quoted 
extensively

We continue to steal the Strips water even though its 
quality deteriorates from year to year We continue to 
steal the Strips tiny land resources in order to found 
there more and more settlements as if we deliberately 
want to make the inhabitants despair and in their 
despair think in termws of having nothing to lose It is 
by our own doing that the Strips workers must now 
spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time 
as they spend working From the military point of view 
we have kept control of no more than half the Strips 
area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and 
resources About a year before Moshe Arens left the 
defence ministry I heard him saying that we should 
withdraw from the Strip come what may His argument 
was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and 
deeper He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak 
Shamir but he rejected it Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too

Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can 
also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being 
implemented The Qatif Block settlements founded by 
the first Rabin government of 197477 are intended to 
divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves Efraim 
Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli 
this enterprise is The Qatif Block is now producing 40 
per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export and a 
substantial proportion of cut flowers He also deals with 
the subsidies the settlers receive considerably 
augmented by the present government Owing to them 
housing units are cheap The present government does 
not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block 
Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage 
for his house on top of a grant of 18000 shekels 
6500

Such data shows that Israels plans apply whether the 
Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to 
work in Israel The economic motivations were explained 
by Danny Rubinstein in Haaretz in March

From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be 
sealed off hermetically and all the Strips workers could 
be barred from entering IsraelEven though accurate 
data is hard to come by it is indisputable that during the 
last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving 
daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased from 
80000 in the mid80s to 40000 today But the decrease 
is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel 
from Gaza It is also due to the drastic curtailment of 
demand for Gazan labour in Israel With unemployment 
in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments 
blocks virtually halted the workers from Gaza are no 
longer really needed

Gazas total dependence

The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent 
on Israel In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has 
been an increase in subcontracted work for Israeli 
factories mostly footware and textiles Thousands of 
small workshops employing an average of four workers 
get their raw materials or unfinished products together 
with detailed working instructions from Israeli factories 
Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that 
the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent 
of that in the West Bank which in turn stands at half the 
average wage in Israel and besides the Gazan employer 
does not pay any social security for his employees If 
the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that 
in Israel the profits of Israeli factories and even of 
Palestinian subcontractors must be vast

They are higher still when a Gazan subcontractor 
provides labour to be performed at home with the 
familys help The livelihood of tens of thousands of 
Gazans depends on such subcontracted work Many of 
them are women and children paid about ten shekels 
350 a day which can last 12 hours or more There can 
be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan 
labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition 
of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from 
the Strip

Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from 
what was created straight after Israels conquest in 
1967 In this respect one should not be deluded by the 
talk nowadays fashionable about Israeli gestures 
intended to encourage economic development in the 
territories As Israeli journalists point out all permits 
for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval 
by the Shin Bet Behind all the professed goodwill there 
is no desire to solve problems just the attitude of a good 
colonialist willing to do something for the benefit of the 
natives but on condition that they behave nicely do not 
become rebellious and never do anything against the 
interests of the metropolis its economic interests 
included wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February The 
development of subcontracted work in the Gaza Strip 
accords perfectly with Selas diagnosis

Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work 
In all branches of the economy lobbies have been set in 
motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from 
the threat of any Palestinian competition The method is 
simplicity itself As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds 
in persuading the government or even the trade and 
industry minister alone a military order is issued 
prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel If this 
does not suffice a Palestinian factory may be denied a 
licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse 
its production Among the most active of such lobbies is 
the agricultural one It has succeeded in limiting exports 
of Gazan vegetables except for those grown by settlers 
not only to Israel but also to Europe where they 
otherwise might compete with Israeli exports

Perpetuaring apartheid

Labours goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in 
the territories The same goal is shared by the US which 
otherwise could not support the Labour government so 
firmly In my view one of the reasons the US feels 
happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its 
greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive This 
point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Maariv who 
deplored the settlers failure which he attributed to 
Likuds inefficiency he showed that the peak yearly 
settlement growth occured during the term of office of 
the National Unity government ie 198490 in which 
Rabin served throughout as the defence minister 
Likuds reputation for settling the territories better than 
Labour is false attributable to the many tiny settlements 
without strategic value founded under Shamir for 
symbolic reasons

To sum up Labours policy unconditionally supported by 
the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the 
efficiency with which it is implemented According to 
that policy the territories are to be divided into two 
parts The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly 
and the minor part indirectly In my view this racist 
scheme is doomed to ultimately fail but at a horrifying 
price in human suffering The sooner its true nature is 
recognised the less suffering it may cause
