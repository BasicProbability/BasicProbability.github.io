   You appear to be referring to Moshe Dayan  How do you know that the
   evicted Jordanians were not provided with something else  In fact
   this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
   not own but received compensation for their loss anyways  Woe to
   Jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
   by force with ethnic cleansing of any remaining Jews is
   disgusting and shameful  

Does anyone have a reference to the claim that the Arabs in the
Moghrabi district were squatters  I havent seen this in the books
I have read  I havent seen the opposite either
