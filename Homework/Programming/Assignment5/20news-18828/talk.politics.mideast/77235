  In the NY Times on Sunday May 2 in an article on Somalia a
  reporter writes
  
      But last year Iran quietly took over four islands belonging
    to the United Arab Emirates and deported their people with hardly a
    protest from the United States 
  
  Does anyone know what this is referring to  I seem to have missed it
  Spiked no doubt 
 
  There was something in the NYT and other sources about this for a few
  days  It is an ongoing border disupute and when the Iranians kicked
  out the UAE people it was briefly reported this was many moons ago
  I dont recall reading of any public US comment if it were a strong
  protest I probably would have seen it
 
 Those islands would be Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs I presume
 I dont know about a fourth The latter two islands belong to Iran and so
 
 According to the NY Times the 4 islands belong to the United Arab
 Emirates

The NY Times is in error This is not simply my opinion even the Arab sources
that I use do not make this claim This of course is assuming that the NY
Times was refering to the islands that I named above Of those islands only
Abu Musa has been in dispute and Iranian occupation of that island predates
the existence of the UAE
