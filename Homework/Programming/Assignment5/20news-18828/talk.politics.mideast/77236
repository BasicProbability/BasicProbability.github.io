	UNITED NATIONS UPI  The Muslimdominated government in Bosnia
Herzegovina asked the UN Security Council Tuesday to withdraw all UN
personnel from Bosnian territory as a first step toward lifting the
international arms embargo against the former Yugoslav republic
	The Bosnian government saying the presence of UN personnel had
become an impediment to critical decisions by the international
community indicated the withdrawal of the peacekeepers and relief
workers would persuade Western governments to lift the arms embargo so
Muslims could defend themselves against Bosnian Serbs

	The Security Council imposed the arms embargo on the whole of the
former Yugoslavia in 1991 when fighting erupted between Serb

The imposed it knowing that Serbia has a stockpile of weapons and that
Bosnia will have next to nothing to defend itself Many experts predicted
a Massacre as early as March 1992 but the Security Coucil knew what it
was doing


	France and Britain have opposed US proposals for military air
strikes against Bosnian Serbs saying such strong action would lead to
retaliation against their troops and personnel

	The Bosnian move Tuesday was in part a bid to undermine the British
and French opposition to military intervention based on fears for the
safety of European peacekeeping troops and humanitarian personnel

	Silajdzics ambassador to the United Nations Mohamed Sacirbey who
conveyed the letter to the Security Council members told reporters that
the peacekeepers mandate should be modified or they should withdraw

	He said if the Security Council refuses to accede to the request his
government will take another step He did not elaborate on what
other steps the government might take

	In his letter to the council Silajdzic said President Clinton
understood well the Muslims commitment and desperate plight because
the United States has been seeking support for lifting of the arms
embargo
	Silajdzic said the international community has not realized that the
war in BosniaHerzegovina was a war of fascist aggression and the
maintenance of the arms embargo was an act of arrogant indifference to
the fate of hundreds of thousands of loyal Bosnian citizens who plead
only for the right to defend themselves
	We beseech the Security Council to cease an arms embargo that has
in practice constituted an international intervention against our
legitimate rights as a member of the United Nations Silajdzic said

Now read this Tim Clock co
	The request to the Security Council took some members by surprise
even though the complaints have been aired by the Bosnian government for
some time The only allies the Muslims could find in the council are
            
nonaligned and Islamic countries which have been calling for the

Muslims right to selfdefense a provision enshrined in the UN
Charter
