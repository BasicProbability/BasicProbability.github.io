Actually this strife in Yugoslavia goes back a long way Bosinan Muslims
in collaboration with the Nazis did to Serbians after the first world
war what Serbs are doing to Muslims now This is not a fresh case of

I dont have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you 
refer Is this an explicit statement by some document Or is it your 
interpretation of statements in such literature Or is this a figment 
of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script In 
any case a fascinating piece of analysis Here are the facts

This generally proArmenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust 

a Dro the butcher the former dictator of xSoviet Armenia and the 
architect of the genocide of 25 million Muslims the most respected 
of Nazi Armenian leaders established an Armenian Provisional Republic 
in Berlin during World War II 

b this provisional government fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan SuperRace 

c they published an AntiSemitic racist journal thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews and 

d they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30000 members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht

 
In fact by 1942 Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast 
network of proGerman collaborators that extended over two continents 
Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and WaffenSS in 
Russia and Western Europe Armenians were involved in espionage and 
fifthcolumn activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula 
They were promised an independent state under German protection in 
an agreement signed by the Armenian National Council A copy of 
this agreement can be found in the Congressional Record November 1 
1945 see Document 1 On this side of the Atlantic Nazi Armenians 
were aware of their brethrens alliance They had often expressed 
proNazi sentiments until America entered the war


In 1941 while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi
concentration camps the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first
Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In 1943 this battalion 
had grown into eight battalions of 30000strong under the command of Dro 
the butcher who was the former dictator of xSoviet Armenia and the 
architect of the coldblooded genocide of 25 million Turks and Kurds 
between 19141920 An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious 
Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged 
by this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of 
extermination of the Jews

This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and
exterminated 25 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army
