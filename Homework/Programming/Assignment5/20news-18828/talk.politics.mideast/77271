please dont be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not
 yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who
are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats 
the way the western press use the word muslim in this Bosnian debacle has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from childhood was 
changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended
