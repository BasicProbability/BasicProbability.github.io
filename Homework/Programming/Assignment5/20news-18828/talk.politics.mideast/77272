   It is your responsibility for posting quotes in context  Your
   phony research center is the source of the most unscholarly
   outofcontext agendaridden and sophmoric propaganda that I
   have ever seen  

Take a look in the mirror Mark
Whatever
Anyway Elias should take a look at my quotes to find real effective
ways of getting your point across  Notice that all the quotes are 
recent  Buy a clue Nazi man from up north
