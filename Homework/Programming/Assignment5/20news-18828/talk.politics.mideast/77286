 Actually just after the FIRST world war many Muslims were killed by Serbs
 Under Serbianled regime between the two world wars many Croats were
 also killed especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan 6 1929

 please dont be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
 Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam Islam 
 is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is not
  yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims who
 are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
 speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats 
 the way the western press use the word muslim in this Bosnian debacle has 
 kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from childhood was 
 changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended

   It is indeed different usage of the word Muslim  In Bosnia  it is more or
less used as an ethnic term not as religious one  There are people in Bosnia
who refer to themselves as Christian Bosnian Muslims if you can make sense
of that  Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have the same language 
Bosnian Muslims are mainly beleivers of Islam I got this from Bosnian Muslim
friend of mine who goes to University of Texas in Austin
