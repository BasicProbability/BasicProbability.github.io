  Under such
conditions it is very easy for Serbs to play a divideandconquer
game and to get the Muslims and Croats who have strong common


It is the Serbs who were divided when Croatia and BosniaHercegovina 
attempted to secede from Yugoslavia ripping more than 2000000 Serbs
and their property out of Yugoslavia 

It is the Croats that were divided at least 70000 were left in Serbian
province of Vojvodina It is the Muslims that were divided 200000
left in the region of Sanjak that now belongs to Serbia If the Serbs
in Croatia and BosniaHercegovina want selfdetermination the same
right should be given to Croats and Muslims and Albanians and Hungarians
in Serbia Why should Serbia be exempted
