It is the Croats that were divided at least 70000 were left in Serbian
province of Vojvodina It is the Muslims that were divided 200000
left in the region of Sanjak that now belongs to Serbia 


If Croats are now divided it is because Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia
Croats in Croatia BH and Serbia were in one countryYugoslavia
until they divided themselves 

If Muslims are now divided it is because BH seceded from Yugoslavia
Muslims in Croatia BH and Serbia were in one countryYugoslavia
until they divided themselves

That Croats and Muslims in Yugoslavia decided to divide themselves does
not give them the right to divide Serbs in Yugoslavia

Croatia and BH shoulder the burden for dividing their own nations among
various unstable countries
