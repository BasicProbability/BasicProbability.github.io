 Muslim in exYugoslavia was a nation not a religion  In fact not
 all Muslims in BH are followers of Islam  Therefore there do did
 exist in exYugoslavia Christian Muslims  

Yeah  Thats it   Youve really outdone yourself this time Nick
Dont forget the Davidian Muslims 

Islam is not a race  Its a religion  You can be white black
Fijian or Alaskan  I guess you didnt absorb too much of the Malcolm
X interest circulating  You see the whole point of Islam is that it
stresses equality amongst all peoples  Now I do realize this is
difficult for you to comprehend given your staunch beliefs in Serbian
ethnic cleansing but give it a try its really not that difficult


     Our white knight for Islam rides in again Our instant expert
on religion race and ethnicity is at the door Stand back all Let 
him through Hes going to singlehandedly rescue Islam from all these
dastardly mistakes misquotes misconceptions

 The war is not a religious war and it is not an ethnic war  

Thats right its a Disneyland war  all a setup for the TV cameras
There are also people who believe man never landed on the moon that
the whole Apollo story was done in TV studios

 It is a
 civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
 instead of pens  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders all
 chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
 peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements 

Terms of secession  You are of course joking right Nick  Nobody
chose to fight  Bosnia and Croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
welldocumented genocide  That makes them an outside aggressor  Its
a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing  There is
no question of civil war

     Did it occur to you that there is such a thing as Bosnian Serbs
who arent necessarily outsiders And while youre at it could you
please pontificate a little bit about your Islamic pals in the Sudan
who are running amuck in the South kidnapping women and children
and in essence doing the same thing How come we dont hear your 
wonderful treatises on whats happening
out there
