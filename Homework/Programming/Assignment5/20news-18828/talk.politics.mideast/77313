My reference is a 4 page essay in our local Star Tribute newspaper
putting the whole conflict in perspective I will readily admit
that I am no authority in this area however other posteers 
asserted that some Muslims did join hands with Croats and
Nazis in persecuting Serbs In any case past actions do not

And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from
an unnamed source You may indeed be confusing some Muslims 
with Nazi Armenians Altogether 30000 Nazi Armenians served in 
various units in the German Wehrmacht according to Ara J Berkian 
14000 in predominantly Armenian army units 6000 in German army 
units 8000 in various working units and 2000 in the WaffenSS1

A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France
Greece Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit
themselves to the German war effort Derounian says that

Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark Legion 
Armenienne2

That Nazi Armenians like Dro the Butcher and Nezhdeh sided
with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of
Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service

In fall 1942 the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed
to be followed by battalions 810 812 and 813 in spring 1943 In the 
second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814 815 and 816 were created
These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were
attached to the infantry division 162 Also attached to ID 162 were
the field battalions II9 I125 and I198 which were formed between
May 1942 and May 1943 Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the
Nazi army if battalion II73 which was not employed at any time is to be
included1 Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers
Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours

While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the
Second World War Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitlers
defeat They now backed Stalins claims on Eastern Turkish provinces
hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim 
population would be exterminated Stalin played on Armenian national
sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America
for his imperial ambitions1 Stalins ultimatum to the Turkish
government led Truman to formulate his famous Doctrine

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks
