	What is the mental disease when the patient repeats
	the same sentence over and over as a response to
	any kind of outside intrusion Mutlu has similar
	symptomatic anyway The only difference is that
	he has a bigger database 

With your level of understanding my dear friend Mutlu probably
thought that hed be nice and help you genocide apologist to get 
the point Besides all your article reflects is your abundant
ignorance Ignorance is probably the main reason why you historical
revisionist are in such a mess You even make Nazicriminal Armenians 
laugh


 In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul
  It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
  create for ourselves It certainly is possible to severe the artificial
  lifesupport system of an imagined ethnic purity that some of us
  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
  in this alien land
            Sahak Melkonian  1920  Preserving the Armenian purity 


An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the
 systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of 
 the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at 
 least 3040 percent of the population of that republic The 
 memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and 
 eyewitnessed these atrocities was published in the US in
 1926 with the title Men Are Like That Other references abound

                     whatever circumstances you find them Turkish children 
                     also should be killed as they form a danger to the

The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130000 square miles The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4700000 of whom 940000 20 percent were
 Armenian 1200000 25 percent Georgian and 2220000 45 percent Moslem
 Of the latter group 1140000 were Tatars Paradoxically barely onethird
 of Transcaucasias Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds Erevan
 uezd the administrative center of the province had only 44000 Armenians
 as compared to 68000 Moslems By the time of the Russian Census of 1897
 however the Armenians had established a scant majority 53 percent in the
 guberniia it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent or 670000 of the 1120000
 inhabitants This impressive change in the provinces ethnic character 
 notwithstanding there was on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic a solid block of 370000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia

We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination Our troops surrounded village after village 
 Little resistance was offered Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work Some of the Tartars escaped of course They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey The rest were killed And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages They are quiet now those villages except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead
