For those of you who are against US to commit ground troops fine just lift the armsembargo on BOTH
sides since we know that serbs always got the heavy weapons form federal army 

Wake up West and admit that you are the most uncivilized the most hypocratic and the most violent
bunch on this earth

It is also so easy to blame the West for their indiffernce to
real Bosnian suffering  How about the moslem world about 1 billion
How about them ha  What they are doing to stop this
massacre  Why the oil rich Arab states make the Bosnian crises 
a national interest of the West especially for Europeans  We all 
know they can do it over night dont we Blaming West and asking 
why they dont put their life into danger seems to be the choice of 
muslims too  I think who is sleeping is not the West  They are wide 
awake  They are trying to save the face  


Please read my post carefully I am saying that lift the arms emargo
and let the MUSLIMS defend themselves The point is these Europians 
civilized countries neither want to get intervene militarily themselves
and nor they like to see the muslims of the world to help the oppressed
Remember what happened almost one year ago when the so called UN discovered
some riffles in an Iranian jet in Bosnia The west is not indifferent
in this matter they are siding with Serbs by keeping this embargo on only
muslim side okay onpaper on both sides
