 Muslim in exYugoslavia was a nation not a religion  In fact not
 all Muslims in BH are followers of Islam  Therefore there do did
 exist in exYugoslavia Christian Muslims  

Yeah  Thats it   Youve really outdone yourself this time Nick
Dont forget the Davidian Muslims 

Islam is not a race  Its a religion  You can be white black
Fijian or Alaskan 

This does not change the fact that Muslim is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely independent and immaterial of
any religious considerations
 

 It is a
 civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
 instead of pens  The Croat Muslim and Serb political leaders all
 chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
 peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements 

Terms of secession  You are of course joking right Nick  Nobody
chose to fight  Bosnia and Croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their
welldocumented genocide  That makes them an outside aggressor  Its
a simple genocide a classical example of ethnic cleansing  There is
no question of civil war

You only wish it were so

More than 2000000 residents of Croatia and BH have not accepted the
terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the entire territories of the former
Yugoslav republics of Croatia and BH

Oh BTW Yugoslavia was internationally recognized when it was 
destroyed by Tudjman Izetbegovic Milosevic and the international
community led by Germany  If Yugoslavias borders could be changed
against its will then certainly Croatias borders and BHs borders
can be changed as well  

As I have stated many times the civil war in exYugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession borders etc for Croatia and BH are
finally agreed upon  Serbs Croats and Muslims will all have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement
