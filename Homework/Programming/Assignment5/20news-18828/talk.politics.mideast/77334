    A perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of
    400 men who advocated murdering Jews and destroying the State
    of Israel compared to the deafening silence over the abusive
    treatment of Jews in Arab countries during the past 50 years

Never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial  
And Israel was supposed to uphold Western values eh

          
    I doubt if the nonJewish world is even capable of having any
    compassion towards Jews as antisemitism is so ancient and so
    basic to both Christianity and Islam  

Your doubts are unsubstantiated have some faith in us



Check your facts before bashing Islam again While there may be Muslim  
antisemites this is no way a tenet of the religion Saying antisemitism is  

Yes I agree  Lets say I call my self a XXX  I go and shoot your family 
in cold blood  Does that mean that XXX is responsible No  I am
People tend to associate others with colorcreedetc it is a form of racism



basic to Islam is implicating the entire Muslim world based on a selective  
sampling of a few people and it flies in the face of what Islam teaches
