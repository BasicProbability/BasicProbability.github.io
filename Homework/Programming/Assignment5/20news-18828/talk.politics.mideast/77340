Subject Re The Mufti again meanwhile they support the genocide of Bosnians

In article 93133155403YZKCUCUNYVMBITNET Yaakov Kayman YZKCUCUNYVMBITNET writes
So why not condemn the Mufti for his Nazi leanings and condemn all his
supporters while also condemning the similarly genocidal killing of
innocents Muslim or not in BosnoiaHerzegovina Hatred and bigotry
remain just that no matter who practices them

Indeed Yaqouv just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and
Kahanists right   Or they are exempt from condemnation and allowed
to hate

I know youll answer me indirectly it doesnt bother me a bit
Keep it up

Steel whos never pissed off
