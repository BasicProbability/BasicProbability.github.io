Is this really what you and Rached and others in the general
westisevilzionistsrulehatewestoryouareapuppet crowd
want Ilyess

Its noteworthy that the posts about the west being
evil etc are made not in some Islamic hellhole but from
the west If the west is so bad why do they come here
Notice how they comfortably exercise their rights to
free expression something completely absent in their
own countries
