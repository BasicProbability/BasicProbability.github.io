In article 30925galaxyucredu raffiwatnxt08ucredu Raffi R Kojian writes

You know it is true dont you

Well apparently we have another son of Dro the Butcher to contend with 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist but a fact

I will dissect articlebyarticle paragraphbyparagraph linebyline 
liebylie revisionbyrevision written by those on this net who plan 
to prove that the Armenian genocide of 25 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic unredressed genocide We are neither in 
xSoviet Union nor in some similar ultranationalist fascist dictatorship 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest Also feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALASDPAARF terrorists
the Armenian pseudoscholars or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations

xSoviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 25 million 
Turkish men women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide 
You and those like you will not get away with the genocides coverup

During the First World War and the ensuing years  19141920 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide 
tried to complete its centuriesold policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 25 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1000 year homeland

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people
This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government
and international political leaders such as US Ambassador Mark 
Bristol William Langer Ambassador Layard James Barton Stanford 
Shaw Arthur Chester John Dewey Robert Dunn Papazian Nalbandian 
Ohanus Appressian Jorge Blanco Villalta General Nikolayef General 
Bolkovitinof General Prjevalski General Odiselidze Meguerditche

                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks
