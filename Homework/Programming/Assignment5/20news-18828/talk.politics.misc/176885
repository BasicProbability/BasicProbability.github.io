  California Insurance Commissioner Endorses Federal Legislation to
 Protect Consumers from Scam Insurance Companies

I may be a little dense but I would have thought that protecting consumers
from scam insurance companies would be the prime objective of something 
called the Cal insurance Commission If they arent accomplishing that now
then why do we need them

Very simple  An Insurance Commissioner is a bureaucrat  a regulator
It is hisher duties to make rules to enforce laws  Heshe cannot
make laws  If there is no law that covers a specific subject say
scam insurance companies a regulator cannot create one  So they have
to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted  For
the California Insurance Commissioner there are two possible legislative
bodies  the California State Legislature and the US Congress  We all
know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes esp 
along the lines of insurance reform legislation negative movement  So
Garamendi wants the feds to do it because a he has a better chance
of getting a federal law through and b since many of the scam
companies work across state linesnational borders it is better to
have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions
