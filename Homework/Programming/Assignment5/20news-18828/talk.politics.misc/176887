Subject Clintons sister Shalala


Last night I heard something about Bill Clintons sister being
involved in a marijuana bust and the news being suppressed I also
heard something about her being an excon This source is not
reliable though It was a collagebooklet advertising a local band

Can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details Im
surprised I havent seen anything about this in this newsgroup

Also does anyone know what happened to the charges that Shalala was a
regular pot smoker when she was in college This ghastly accusation
was reported on CNN Streamline News the day she was nominated then I
never heard anything about it again

Its almost enough to make me want to start an ActUp type campaign
to invade the privacy of closet smokers If only this type of
publicity didnt violate peoples rights
