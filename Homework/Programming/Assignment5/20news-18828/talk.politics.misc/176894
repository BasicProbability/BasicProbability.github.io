The official and legal term for rape is the crime of forcing a FEMALE 
to submit to sexual intercourse

Please supply me with some references  I was not aware that all states
had the word FEMALE in the rape statutes  I am sure others are surprised
as well  I know thats how it works in practice nicenfair NOT but
was unaware that it was in the statutes as applying to FEMALES only
uniformly throughout the US

I agree mostly with Chris  It is unfortunately IMO true that the FBI
figures for rape based on the uniform crime report report only female
rapes However some states such as Illinois are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition
