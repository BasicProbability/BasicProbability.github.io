  I thought I was clear  Because homosexuals support laws to force
  employment of homosexuals against the will of some employers they
  are attempting to interfere with private acts between mutually consenting
  adults
 
    Ok Ill leave others to discuss your use of statistics but I think Im
 able to discuss liberterian ideas
    The ideas are good They seek to maximise individual rights by keeping
 governments out of transactions between consenting adults If an employer wants
 to discriminate against a group shehe should be allowed to to maximise their
 freedom The discriminatees can go elsewhere
    Unfortunately it doesnt relate to maximising total individual rights
 within a community If an employer or shopkeeper or whatever can discriminate
 in this way then the freedom of the discriminatee goes down Because people do
 not live in perfect economic conditions with perfect mobility unlimited
 numbers of potential employers of their skills unlimited places to buy goods
 the liberterian argument leads to a decrease in the amount of liberty in the
 community 

You mean if a large part of the population supports discrimination 
against homosexuals they will be injured  But if a large part of the
population supports such discrimination how did that law get passed
