 The official and legal term for rape is the crime of forcing a FEMALE 
 to submit to sexual intercourse
 
 Please supply me with some references  I was not aware that all states
 had the word FEMALE in the rape statutes  I am sure others are surprised
 as well  I know thats how it works in practice nicenfair NOT but
 was unaware that it was in the statutes as applying to FEMALES only
 uniformly throughout the US
 
 Chris

There may be some confusion here  The Uniform Crime Reports program
run by the FBI defines rape as a female victim only crime  even
though some states have the laws desexed  I suspect that this causes
male victims of rape to be left out of the UCR data
 
Clayton E Cramer uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer  My opinions all mine
Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all
