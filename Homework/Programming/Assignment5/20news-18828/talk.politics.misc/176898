 Unfortunately homosexuals dont believe in this concept of freedom
 They believe that they have a right to FORCE people to hire them
 rent to them and do business with them regardless of the feelings
 or beliefs of the other person
 
 Allow me to point out that Clayton is once again unfairly lumping an
 entire class of people as if they all have one will  Having completely
 dived into the abyss of believing that there are no queers in the world
 who think differently from the childmolestationadvocating minority on
 socmotss he doesnt even notice that hes starting a sentence with
 They believe when the referent of that they is millions of people
 so few as to be irrelevant

If you dont want to be lumped together as a group stop insisting
on being treated as a member of a group

  Force people to hire  No  Require people to give them a fair 
  look  Yes

 You give them a fair look  You decide that you dont want to hire
 the guy wearing the NAMBLA Tshirt  He files a lawsuit  You lose
 Yes such laws force you to hire homosexuals
 
 Pedophiles as well

Sexual orientation is not defined by the antidiscrimination law
that was passed last year  Pedophilia isnt a sexual orientation

 And Cramer let me describe how youd have it and see if this is
 accurate  I apply for a job at a computer company  They see Im
 wearing some article of homosexual adornment I dunno maybe a
 Silence  Death pin or something  They turn me down because of
 that  I cant do a darned thing and have to go look somewhere else
 Am I correct in assuming that you wholeheartedly approve of the
 companys actions or at least that you wholeheartedly support their
 right to take that action

I wholeheartedly support their right to take this action  I wouldnt
do it myself unless it was something like the NAMBLA Tshirt

 How about  a black man applies for a job at a bank  The bank decides
 based on statistics a black person would be more likely to steal
 money and denies the man the job  Would you support the banks right
 to this freedom  If not explain how this differs

I support their right to do so just like I support your right to 
engage in sodomy with consenting adults but I think they are doing 
something wrong  I wouldnt do business with such a bank

 Clayton has repeatedly said that Californias statutes classify
 pedophilia as a sexual orientation and that discriminating on the
 basis of sexual orientation is illegal
 
 If true Im frankly amazed  But I dont trust Clayton to give me
 the whole story  Would someone clarify for me whether this is true
 what sort of discrimination Claytons talking about jobs housing
 hate crimes and whether the effect of the law is really that
 a daycare has to hire an admitted pedophile
