  Unfortunately homosexuals dont believe in this concept of freedom
  They believe that they have a right to FORCE people to hire them
  rent to them and do business with them regardless of the feelings
  or beliefs of the other person
 
 ha ha ha oh Clayton youre so good so consistent so predictable
 yup thats right they these homosexual people want to FORCE you to
 ignore whats none of your fucking business  IE I will explain slowly
 their sexual orientation should be irrelevant as irrelevant as their
 gender skin colour religious affiliation attitude to handgun ownership
 etc  They want to FORCE you to hire the best person for the job rent the
 accomodation to the person who will look after it do business with whoever
 will make you money

Yet when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this 
philosophy to cigarette smokers so that people who smoked away
from the work couldnt be discriminated against by employers
the liberal Gov Wilder vetoed it  Which shows that liberals dont
give a damn about best person for the job its just a power
play
 
Clayton E Cramer uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer  My opinions all mine
Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all
