 Slavery makes economic sense it NEVER makes MORAL sense when human
 muscle power is an economically valuable asset Agricultural slavery might
 have lasted right up to the first mechanical cotton reaper but no
 further reapers are cheaper than slaves and dont have to be fed during
 the winter 
 
 This argument makes a several fundamental errors  First agricultural
 slavery was not limited to production of cotton  In the American south
 slave labor was used extensively to grow tobacco sugar and rice all
 of which remained labor intensive enterprises well into the 20th century

And of course in states like Kentucky and Virginia not wellsuited to
largescale plantations slave labor was used to make one of the most 
valuable agricultural products of all more slaves  In some ways this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
aspect of American slavery

 Second although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to
 reduce the demands for labor eventually it was only in the 1940s 
 the mechanization of cotton production in the South largely eliminated
 the labor intensive character of the operation long after the first
 mechanical cotton reaper was invented

This is an interesting question  Steinbecks Grapes of Wrath
published in the 1930s uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
production in Arkansas as the cause of the Joad family being evicted
from the land  How many years were involved in the mechanization of
cotton farming  When did this first appear
