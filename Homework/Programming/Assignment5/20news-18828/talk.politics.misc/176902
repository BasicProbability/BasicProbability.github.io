  labor is a tough one Labor is defined economically as the efforts
  both mental and physical of humans Capital is defined as intermediate
  goods used to create other goods and services Now if a slave is considered
  an intermediate good then the slave has now been dehumanized and is 
  simply a machine Not good for the antislave ie prohuman rights 
  argument So slaves are humans and they produce labor 
 
 Sorry  The question of defining slave labor is no tougher than 
 defining the labor of a horse an ox or any other livestock  Both
 legally and economically in a slaveeconomy slaves are NOT humans  
 they are livestock

Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
not humans  They were outside our society and similar phrases that
basically meant that they didnt have to recognized as having the same
rights as a free person but they were never considered not human to
my knowledge

 Like a horse that pulls a plow a slaves labor is the return on the
 capital required to purchase and feed him  The parallel is so obvious
 Im not sure how you missed it  After all its was the liberty to 
 use their property as they saw fit that motivated Southern planters
 to emphasize the importance of states rights

If that were the case the slave states would not have passed so many
laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished
with their property  Examples laws prohibiting manumission without
legislative grant laws prohibiting teaching slaves to read  write
