 Some people are not very good at getting the best deal for their 
 effort and others are unwilling to put forth much effort even in
 the face of economic incentives There will always be some people 
 who are stupid or lazy relative to the ability or effort of most 
 others The question is what do you do with them There are three 
 options
 
 2 Kill those who are not productive as a drain upon society 
    This is the communist All who do not toil shall not eat  
    Lenin or fascist approach
 

    Youre being too generous to the communists I think  In practice
communism has solved the problem by killing off anybody who is too
productive and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards  The mass butchery of kulaks
in the USSR is a good instance of this
    A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee  I often wonder
just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would
have been forced to remain in Cuba  Would they have revolted and killed
him off or been killed
    Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in
load it up so heavily with attack dogs barbed wire and land mines that
most people fleeing over it die and then give everyone the choice of
obedience prison or flight  This would be a bad sciencefiction novel
if the East Germans hadnt actually done it  The last person to die
crossing the wall as I recall was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
back  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that but he fled to
socialists in Chile
    Its good to be kind to ones intellectual opponents but sometimes
its a sheer waste of time
