Subject Re Top Ten Reasons Not to Aid Russians

In article C513wJ75yencorecom rcollinsnsencorecom Roger Collins writes

I ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid frivilous things with OUR money  Then I think the Constitution
was supposed to do that  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries  Seriously

Roger Collins


Since you asked Article I Section 1  Article I Section 8  Article I 
Section 10  Article II Section 2  Article VI  Sixteenth Amendment
