   	No the definition of resident is very specific It is the
   same thing as alien Look it up Remember that the common usage of
   the words ARE NOT always their legal meaning

   This I gotta see some authority for

from Blacks Law Dictionary Revised 4th Ed page 1473

RESIDENCE  A factual place of abode  Living in a particular
locality  Reese v Reese 179 Misc 665 40 NYS2d 468 472
Zimmerman 175 Or 585 155 P2d 293 295  It requires only bodily
presence as an inhabitant of a place  In re Campbells Guardianship
216 Minn 113 11 NW2d 786 789

     As domicile and residence are usually in the same place
they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning but they are
not identical terms for a person may have two places of residence as
in the city and country but only one domicile  Residence means
living in a particular locality but domicile means living in that
locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home  Residence
simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place
while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an
intention to make it ones domicile  In re Rileys Will 266 NYS
209 148 Misc 588  Residence demands less intimate local ties
than domicile but domicile allows absence for indefinite
period if intent to return remains  Immigration Act 1917 sec 3 8
USCA sec 136 e p  Transatlantica Italiana v Elting
CCANY 74 F2d 732 733  But see Ward v Ward 115 WVa 429
176 SE 708 709 Southwestern Greyhound Lines v Craig 182 Okl
610 80 P 2d 221 224 holding that residence and domicile are
synonymous terms  Residence has a meaning dependent on context
and purpose of statute  In re Jones 341 Pa 329 19 A2d 280 282

meaning depending on subjectmatter and context of statute  Kemp v
