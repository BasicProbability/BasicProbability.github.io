 What decade did you live in  Unemployment dropped during the 80s 
 inflation dropped during the 80s and interest rates dropped during
 the 80s
 
 	This all may be true but were paying for it now through the
 nose  Our current recession and some would argue the worlds
                     
First off were not in a recession  Weve had a record number of months of
straight economic growth  Even the democrats are admitting that the
recession ofcicially ended in March of 1991

This monthss unemployment rate in California was 94
Sure feels like a recession to me

Maybe we should ask the 83103 people who were laid off this January whether
or not were in a recession That was a figure that was reported in the
New York Times There is no official figure because the Bureau of Labor
Statistics stopped government tracking of layoffs eight months ago due to
budget cuts

The above information was published in Harpers Index Harpers magazine
