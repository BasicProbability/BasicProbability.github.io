I think what you meant to say here was With the current mutation of the US
Constitution under the current police state someone may be charged multiple
times for one act if the victim in question is of the right shade  A single
act should never merit more than on charge  

So if I set off a bomb in the World Trade Center I can only be charged with
more than one murder and not the other five deaths and extensive property
damage  After all the bomb was a single act

ted frank                  However Teel should have mentioned that though 

Again Mr Frank has come to the rescue with his cool headed reason  How
about One charge per victim  Of course Ill think about it in a few days
and find a case where this doesnt apply either  

What the heck I dont study law I just hate lawyers
