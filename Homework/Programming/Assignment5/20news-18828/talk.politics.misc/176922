well i just did a quick medline scan and came up with the following article
by Tashkin that reviews the literature id probably start here

         Document 13
AN   90273700  9007A
AU   TashkinDP
IN   Department of Medicine University of California School of Medicine
     Los Angeles 90024
TI   Pulmonary complications of smoked substance abuse
RF   REVIEW ARTICLE 61 REFS

Why isnt this information in the FAQ on marijuana     If we expect
people to think we are telling them the truth about drugs why does
this group constantly refute every negative thing about almost all
drugs     

Maybe because the claims deserve refute  The above abstract lists various
possible links to cannabis use unfiltered almost guaranteed and lung
problems  Someone may get overly excited when they see that article but 
without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
their data it really doesnt tell you shit  Im going to track down that
study hopefully tomarrow



I never claimed pot was more or less damageing than
cigarettesI was just trying to keep ourselves honest   If we are
going to educate kidsand adultsand tell them the truth about drugs
dont you think a much better approach would be to list the pros and
cons of each type of drug   

What justifies the truth about drugs  Research  What sort of 
research  Correlational data can help establish a theory but it does not
prove anything

How can you expect someone to make a
decision when the PDFA on one hand says that all drugs are absolutely
BAD BAD BADand this newsgroup consistently refuses to admit that
drugs like heroin even have negative side effects    

Heroin is a relatively safe drug  What makes it unsafe are IV administration
and shit like adulterants  There are side effects like withdrawal but they
effect people differently  

Ive seen numerous
posts claiming heroin has lower addiction rates that cigarettes which
might be true but it is very deceiving because heroin is much more
harmful drug to be addicted to than cigarettes   Heroin addicts are
far more prone to end up in the gutter and destroy their family and
friends than people addicted to just cigarettes    

Stereotypical statement  I know people who use heroin and opiates that 
function just fine in society  

This group does
provide some very good information to people but I am worried that
the prolegalizationprodecriminalization movement is being hurt when
it refuses to admit that anysome drugs are VERY harmful

Name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically


      Im all for legalization of most drugs but when someone asks me
about relative risks of certain drugs or possible bad side effects I
would like to know themand not be given the runaround by this
groupwhich recently tried to tell me that pot was not harmful in
any manner to peoples lungs     

NO NO NO  or at least I havent been arguing this  there is not enough
data to form a scientific conclusion  that doesnt mean that cannabis
is benign to users lungs  we can form all the theories we want but they
are only theories  some theories are supported by more evidence than others
and that makes them stronger  

I think its time yall reexamined
your positions and try to understand that you cannot fight the PDFA
by calling them a bunch of liars

the hell I cant  they state UNJUSTIFIED CONCLUSIONS AS FACT as
a POLITICAL strategy to stop drug use



In general I somewhat see what youre saying  And people like Jack Herer
contribute to this  This has been quite a big mindfuck for me recently
and Ive pretty came to the conclusion that you cant trust ANYBODY by
word of mouth alone  my attitude about the general population has
decreased significantly  

gotta run to class
