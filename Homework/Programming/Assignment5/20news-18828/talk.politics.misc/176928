    Now let me get this straight After a nice long rant about
    how people need to take personal responsibility for their
    economic and social lives all of a sudden 1960s radicals
    such as me I guess are responsible for poor peoples
    lifestyles Tell me how that worksor do you think that poor
    people are just too dumb to think for themselves
    
    There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family
    and support systems in general among this nations poor
    Somehow I dont think Murphy Brownor Janis Joplinis at
    the top of any sane persons list
    
    You want to go after my generations vaunted cultural
    revolution for a lasting change for the worse try socalled
    relevant or values education Hey it seemed like a good
    idea at the time How were we to know you needed a real
    education firstI mean we took that for granted

The 1960s generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible

The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
kids would not want for anything  going overboard and creating a nation of
brats

Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969

Apollo 11 and Woodstock

Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
reverted to the cultural level of primitives defecation in public etc

And which group assembled took care of itself and dispersed with no damage
no deaths no large numbers of drug problems 

 
There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of
environmental disaster Weird eh

These opinions are MINE and you cant have em But Ill rent em cheap
