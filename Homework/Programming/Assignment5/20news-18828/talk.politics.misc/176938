Subject Re SupplySider Lightbulb Joke

lips1gov Loren I Petrich writes

 There was once the following joke

 How many supplysiders does it take to screw in a light bulb

 None  They let the free market do it

If the free market places an attractive price on the screwing in of a
light bulb you can bet your bottom dollar that the light bulb will
most certainly get screwed in  and most promptly at that too
 
  The views expressed herein are     Theodore A Kaldis
  my own only  Do you seriously     kaldisremusrutgersedu
  believe that a major university    rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
  as this would hold such views
