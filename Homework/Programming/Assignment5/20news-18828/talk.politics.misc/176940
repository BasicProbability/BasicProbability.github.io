The official and legal term for rape is the crime of forcing a FEMALE
to submit to sexual intercourse

Please supply me with some references  I was not aware that all states
had the word FEMALE in the rape statutes  I am sure others are surprised
as well  I know thats how it works in practice nicenfair NOT but
was unaware that it was in the statutes as applying to FEMALES only
uniformly throughout the US

I agree mostly with Chris  It is unfortunately IMO true that the FBI
figures for rape based on the uniform crime report report only female
rapes However some states such as Illinois are not tabluated because they
refuse to comply with this sexist definition

Insofar as several liberal jurisdictions are concerned the essential
elements of rape are gender neutral Nonetheless I decided to provide
a number of references to support my original argument Blacks Law
Dictionary every law studentlawyers friend defines rape as Unlawful
sexual intercourse with a female without her consent The unlawful
knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will The Model
Penal Code the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures
defines rape as A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife
is guilty of rape if he a compels her to submit by force or by threat of
imminent death MPC 21311a

Indeed the following jurisdictionsstates have statutes similar to the MPC

Alabama Code of Ala 13A661 1992
