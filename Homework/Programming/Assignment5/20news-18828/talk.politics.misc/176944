                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS


                          The Briefing Room


 1010 AM EDT
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know the President is soon 
to be on his way on Amtrack to Camden Yards  Hell be throwing out 
the first pitch
	     
	     Q	  Its MARC the Maryland Area Transit its not 
Amtrack
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh its not Amtrack  Well hes 
going from Union Station youre right  Excuse me
	     
	     Q	  George what exactly are you prepared to do to 
break the logjam with   Senate
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well as you know there are 
discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning 
and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point 
that he believes that our investment package our jobs package needs 
to be passed as quickly as possible  We need this investment for 
summer jobs for immunization for highway construction for the 
important programs that will put people back to work right away this 
summer  And the President continues to believe his program should be 
passed
	     
	     Q	  Will he compromise thats the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well as you know the discussions 
are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and 
Senator Dole lets see what they come up with  But the President 
believes his jobs program should go forward
	     
	     Q	  George would the President be willing to accept 8 
billion for one year which apparently appears to be the compromise 
being offered by 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I dont know what is being 
offered by either side  The Senate discussions are going on right 
now lets see what happens today
	     
	     Q	  Would he go that far  no matter what the 
Republicans have offered so far would he go that far 8 billion per 
year
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes that his 
program should be passed at this time  Clearly were going to be 
willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to 
come up with but Im not going to get into figures right now  Lets 
see what happens
	     
	     Q	  Its reasonable to assume isnt it from what has 
happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order 
to get a vote
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the Republicans seem more 
intrested in stopping progress on the Presidents jobs bill than in 
doing something to create   MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the 
Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the 
Presidents jobs bill than in doing something to create real action 
real jobs this summer for the American people  I think theres no 
question about that  Theres been some frustration of legislative 
activity over the last few days
	     
	     Q	  So youll need to compromise to get your package 
through
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well see what happens with the 
conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning
	     
	     Q	     prepared to compromise 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The Presidents prepared to listen 
to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting 
with Senator Dole 
	     
	     Q	  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not in the least  In fact hes 
been very successful so far in the beginning of his term
	     
	     Q	  How
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He passed his budget in record 
time in six weeks and its a budget which reduces the deficit by 
500 billion over five years  And its a budget which provides for 
important investments in our future  Right now weve also had strong 
passage of his jobs program through the House  Simply because a 
minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock 
and hold up action on the Presidents jobs program is not a sign that 
he is not succeeding overall
	     
	     Q	  He cant beat this can he
	     
	     Q	  The fact is they can do that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the Republicans can stop 
action  Theres no question about that
	     
	     Q	  What are you going to do about it
	     
	     Q	  George what do you know about these alleged notes 
taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears 
that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese that 
when they say yes they mean no
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think thats a complete 
misreading of what happened at the meeting  The context of the 
conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring 
President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime 
Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Ministers 
belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G7 process  
I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and 
etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where 
he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese 
were serious about their commitment to the G7 process
	     
	     Q	   Are you saying that the President said that when 
the Japanese say yes they mean no
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats not  I dont know the 
exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say 
something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime 
Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G7 process
	     
	     Q	  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the 
Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and 
there appears to be 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Ive seen the reports in the 
Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context  It 
does talk about the Japanese  understanding the Japanese points of 
view  I dont think its going to be a problem  I believe that 
there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up 
but Im not positive
	     
	     Q	  George was the specific comment that was made 
specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general 
observation on Japanese etiquette
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The discussion was about 
	     
	     Q	  The specific comment is what Im asking about that 
has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes when the 
Japanese say yes they mean no
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well it was a combination  I mean 
I dont think thats the whole sentence  I think that the specific 
comment was a broad general observation followed up by a specific 
finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that 
Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment
	     
	     Q	  Was he saying it facetiously first
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think it was just a casual 
observation
	     
	     Q	  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to 
clear it up  Has the President sent a message
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No I dont think the President 
spoke I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but 
Im not sure exactly how many
	     
	     Q	  Well this obviously is a bigger deal than youre 
making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No no  It was just that we got 
the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that 
it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no 
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   reports in Vancouver and the 
Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure 
there is absolutely no misunderstanding and I dont believe there is 
on
	     
	     Q	  What is our position about the Japanese  That they 
may have to say one thing but actualy mean another
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  The position on the Japanese 
is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two 
days  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime 
Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit  He reiterated the US 
position the longstanding support for the Japanese position on the 
Kuril Islands but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawas 
commitment to move forward on the G7 process and to play a 
constructive role  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to 
hear that
	     
	     Q	  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq 
for the last few days Im a little confused  What is the US 
policy  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its the same policy that Secretary 
Christopher has reiterated and all of the US officials have 
reiterated  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance 
with all UN resolutions  Right now we do not have that compliance
	     
	     Q	     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies 
Saddam cant stay in office
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right  I think that thats  our 
judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with 
the resolutions and stay in power  But the important point is that 
we expect compliance by Iraq with all UN resolutions and we will 
continue to demand it
	     
	     Q	  And are you concerned the Iran will become the 
dominant power in the area 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Secretary Christopher has also 
spoken to Iran over the last several days and he says we also expect 
full Iranian compliance with all international norms and stopping 
support of terrorism
	     
	     Q	  Thats a very glib statement that he wont stay in 
power if he complies with UN resolutions  On what logic do you 
base that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right now Saddam Hussein is not 
complying with the UN resolutions at all  He is not respecting the 
rights of his people as is required by the UN resolution  He is 
not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections  
He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding 
armaments
	     
	     Q	  Well when do you think that if he did comply he 
would be out of power

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well right now his power rests on 
the repression of his people  If he stopped doing that it would make 
it more difficult for him to stay in power
	     
	     Q	  George back on the stimulus package why is it 
that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure 
politics and perpetuating gridlock  Why is it that  what evidence 
do you have that they just dont have a genuine idealogical 
difference with you thats in good faith
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the fact that several times 
in the past the Republicans many of the ones who are now leading the 
fight for the filibuster have supported the very funding they now 
seek to stop most especially the highway funding  
	     
	     Q	  George in regards to that some of the moderate 
Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to 
them during the  while the plan was put together that they had 
one sort of proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate 
Republicans and that was it  Does the Administration look back and 
thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well Im not sure that its true 
that there was only one meeting  I mean the President met with the 
Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the 
introduction of his package  He met with the entire Senate 
Republican Caucus also for lunch and went up there  We are 
continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who 
have an interest in the Presidents package  We are interested in 
what they have to say as well  But we believe that this program is 
important and were going to continue to fight for it
	     
	     Q	     your all or nothing do it with the Democrats 
alone strategy did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it 
through
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I mean I think that there is 
no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can 
frustrate activity  I mean there is just no question about that  
You only need 40 plus one to keep going  40 plus one to keep going 
and to stop any action and thats what the Republicans are doing
	     
	     Q	     going to rethink the way you attempt to get 
other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of 
the summer
	     
	     Q	     work with Republicans and try to woo some 
Republicans into your camp
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think were going to continue to 
look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the 
Presidents intiatives
	     
	     Q	  But on this one  how are you going to do it 
differently than you did it on this one because on this one you 
really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear 
that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and 
could get it through and you really didnt need Republican votes  
Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for 
particular votes  When you have to go through 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I cant see into the future and 
understand every possible turn in the legislative road  Clearly the 
Presidents going to continue to reach out when he can
	     
	     Q	  You dont have any regrets then about the way you 
have handled it up to now and you dont plan any changes in your 
approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this 
experience
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Obviously the President would like 
his package passed as quickly as possible and hes going to continue 
to press for that  We will continue to reach out to Republicans 
theres not question about that  And well continue to reason with 
them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation  In this 
case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster around 
a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward
	     
	     Q	  Theyre being denied any other legislative means of 
putting their proposals forward
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think theyre being 
	     
	     Q	     any ideas
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think their amendments are being 
defeated I dont know that theyre being denied
	     
	     Q	     to present them
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats not exactly true  I mean 
they get the votes 
	     
	     Q	     that theirs can be passed though by the 
parliamentary rules under which theyre playing
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Unless they get a majority in 
support all the way around no thats not exactly true
	     
	     Q	  George one more on Iraq  Is the administration 
backing any of the Iraqi opposition  Grooming any new leadership
	     
	     Q	     backing any of the Iraqi  leadership
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh I  again were pressing for 
Iraqi compliance  I dont know if we can get into the business of 
grooming leadership  I believe there have been some contacts at 
some levels with Iraqi opposition groups  I dont know  about 
anything recently
	     
	     Q	     Jesse Jackson who of course is not the 
Presidents best friend has however been told that there is to be 
some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the 
President preempted the ball game  Los Angeles  Will he consider 
something like that or any other kind of intervention there
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well as you know the President 
appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown about 10 days ago to be a 
special envoy to California and coordiante cabinet activities around 
the California economic situation including the situation in Los 
Angeles  
	     
	     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles 
by the Education  or have been visits by the Education Secretary 
Mr Riley  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD 
Secretary Cisneros are also going out  And there may be other visits 
by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks  I 
wouldnt rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to 
California  Obviously he is following the situation closely and is 
concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy 
decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities 
which help prevent disturbances  But were going to continue to 
watch it
	     
	     Q	  George as a followup Reverend Jackson is also 
supposed to be outside the ball park today in Baltimore with a 
group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball 
management  Does the President have a position on that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has received 
correspondence from Reverend Jackson  I know that Reverend Jackson 
has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty  
He clearly raises serious questions  There has been some progress in 
baseball over the last several years but still not enough  But the 
President intends to continue to go to the ball game
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to say anything about it today or see 
Reverend Jackson while hes out there
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if he is going to see 
them but as I said the President believes that Reverend Jackson has 
raised some serious questions and its something that as I said 
even though there has been progress its clearly not enough
	     
	     Q	  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball 
game
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not sure about that  I believe 
the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an 
informational pickett  I dont know that he asked him not to go to 
the ball game but he sent a long detailed formal letter outlining 
his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the 
President read it
	     
	     Q	  George the Orioles are playing the Rangers the 
managing partner of the Rangers is George W Bush  Is he going to be 
there and is he going to meet with the President
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know
	     
	     Q	  What is the Mubarak schedule
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I know that President Mubarak is 
coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting they will have a 
lunch and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice 
President Gore
	     
	     Q	  And joint statements tomorrow 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe so yes  At the end 
yes
	     
	     Q	  Is there evidence George that the Egyptians did 
warn the US about a potential terrorist bombing  terrorist 
activities
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As reported in The New York Times 
I mean I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been 
general conversations with the Egyptians as there have been for a 
long period of time  We do have general intelligence sharing I 
mean  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there 
was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward  
The President will continue to investigate the situation but he also 
reiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind
	     
	     Q	  George he did make specific  or the Egyptians 
apparently did issue specific warnings about this individual who 
forgive me this individual who forgive me the name escapes me at 
the moment and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in 
their attempts to get some kind of action
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I dont know if I would 
agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview  He did 
say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a 
network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate 
action  But there was no specific information on this specific 
operation at all
	     
	     Q	  So the White House doesnt feel that any of the 
law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have 
received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in 
not pursuing some kind of 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No not at all
	     
	     Q	  Whats next with Serbia  It got only a passing 
mention in the news conference yesterday 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  You didnt get to ask your 
question
	     
	     Q	  Yes exactly  Was there any agreement on concerted 
action between the two countries  And even if there wasnt what 
does the US do next
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the US is clearly going 
to move forward in the UN today continuing discussions with our 
allies on a sanctions resolution and well continue to look for ways 
to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an 
agreement
	     
	     Q	  George why do you think sanctions is still an 
option  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the 
leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait 
you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day 
said theres no evidence that theyre going to have an effect any 
time soon  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan  When 
does no mean no and you have to do something different
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I mean we are doing something 
different  Were moving forward on further sanctions through the 
UN and those discussions will continue  Were going to continue to 
try and tighten the noose on Serbia and I think that every 
opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time
	     
	     Q	  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo 
MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has said that this is something 
that is under consideration
	     
	     Q	  George do you have any more on Hugh Rodhams 
condition how hes doing
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As far as I know nothings changed
	     
	     Q	  George  week after Mr Mubarak
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its a little unclear  I think 
well be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning 
after the Mubarak visit
	     
	     Q	  Is he going somewhere for Easter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not that I know of
	     
	     Q	  What more can you tell us about the additional aid 
to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Hes going to be consulting with 
the Congress and with our G7 partners over the next couple of weeks  
I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their 
delegation before the  the congressional delegation meets with the 
Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the 
next several weeks
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude 
of the one announced Sunday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not going to discuss the 
magnitude
	     
	     Q	  How about the list of Cold War restrictions where 
do you stand on that 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As the President said yesterday 
hes going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week 
and reviewing it  He believes  hes going to try and get it this 
week and hes going to review the list and were going to take a 
hard look at it
	     
	     Q	  But theyre making it up  I mean its no White 
House involvement Congress is compiling this list
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think hes going to talk to the 
congressional leaders about compiling the list but Im certain well 
be able to get our own researchers working as well
	     
	     Q	  George isnt lifting the arms embargo more of a 
probability than a possibility
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its something thats under 
discussion
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher has said that its a matter 
of time and  for months before that happens
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again all I can say is that its 
something that the President is reviewing  Right now were working 
with our allies in the UN on a sanctions resolution and well 
continue to review other matters
	     
	     Q	  George can you tell us anything about the schedule 
this week  Any travel
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They just asked about that  I 
dont have anything more beyond tomorrows visit with Mubarak right 
now
	     
	     Q	  Are there consultations George with any Jewish 
American organizations concerning JacksonVanick
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know the National Conference 
of Soviet Jewry has a list of I believe 
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   as you know the National 
Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of I believe 200 Refuseniks  
Well certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate 
discussions
	     
	     Thanks
