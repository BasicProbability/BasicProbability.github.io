        EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME

                       En Route to Camden Yards



1145 AM EDT
	     
	     Q	  Mr President what do you think of Jesse Jacksons 
protest today
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I think its an informational protest  
I think its fine  The owners put out a statement few days ago 
which they say was the first step in you know efforts to increase 
minority ownership and minority increases in management  I think we 
should  Im encouraged by Don Baylors appointment out in Colorado  
And I think its time to make a move on that front  So I think its 
a legitimate issue and I think its  like I said its an 
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to 
the game  So I think its good
	     
	     Q	  Do you think theyre moving fast enough
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  Well I think that it was a good first 
step  And I think youll see some movement now  And I think its an 
issue that deserves some attention and theyre obviously going to 
give it some  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will 
highlight the issue  So I think its fine
	     
	     Q	  Mr President how about the logjam in the Senate 
on the economic stimulus plan  Do you think theyll be able to break 
that and get cloture
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  I dont know were working at it  I 
mean its a classic  there was an article in the paper today one 
of the papers I saw which pretty well summed it up  They said you 
know this is a  its just a political power play  In the Senate 
the majority does not rule  Its not like the country  Its not 
like the  its not like the House  If the minority chooses they 
can stop majority rule  And thats what theyre doing  There are a 
lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote 
for the stimulus program but theres enormous partisan political 
pressure not to do it  
	     
	     And of course what it means is that in this time when 
no new jobs are being created even though there seems to be an 
economic recovery it means that for political purposes theyre 
willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston 
and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle  Its very 
sad  I mean the block grant program was designed to create jobs in 
a hurry based on local priorities and its one that the Republicans 
had always championed  Just about the only Democrat champions of the 
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots 
level governors and senators  I just think its real sad that they 
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep 
Americans out of work  I think its a mistake
	     
	     THE PRESS  Thank you
