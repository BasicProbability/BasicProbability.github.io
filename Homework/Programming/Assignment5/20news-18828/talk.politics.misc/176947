In article C4y3DDL1npanixcom roypanixcom Roy Radow writes
Anyone with any degree of sensitivity or awareness has to be  
concerned about the horrendous amount of child abuse that 
exists in this country 

The critical factor here is whether the sexual activity is forced  

When a child is forced there is often damage on the other hand
consensual relationships are often found to be positive experiences 
for all concerned

Why all the quote marks Roy  I can see that they might be appropriate where
there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context 
or that they have been appropriated Newspeakstyle but reading your comments above
one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that child abuse
forced sexual activity and damage caused by this is nonexistant or
greatly overblown

Positive experiences indeed
