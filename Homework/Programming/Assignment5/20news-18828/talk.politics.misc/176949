NAMBLAs presence in the SF Gay Pride Parade says quite a bit
It says that either the parade organizers want to show support
for NAMBLA or they themselves have a fundamental misunderstanding
of their rights and responsibilities  I would really really like
to believe the latter but I would need some help to do so

 There are dozens of examples of the latter NAMBLA is an especially
 glaring one but hardly the only one

Perhaps though the exclusion of the Gay Perotistas in the
SF Gay Pride Parade would make me think that they had some
clue in this regard  Dozens of examples  I dont know
