It should be noted that NAMBLA has not been present in the
other 600 or so gay parades in the nation While I view this
as an isolated event I am very troubled by its reccurence

I hope Im not going to hate myself for getting involved in
this discussion but I felt obliged to keep things factually
accurate

Last year NAMBLA marched in the Pride Parades in Boston New
York and San Francisco It was not the first time we
participated in these parades and it will not be the last I
have marched with the NAMBLA contingent in New York every
year for more than a decade

Thank you for correcting the error in my post to the net
This information came from a newspaper article that was
fuzzy in my mind  I can only wonder if there have been
similar outcries about NAMBLAs presence in the parades
of New York and Boston

Yours in Liberation from Molestation
