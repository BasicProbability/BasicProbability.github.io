 You mean if a large part of the population supports discrimination 
 against homosexuals they will be injured  But if a large part of the
 population supports such discrimination how did that law get passed

   An addition to antidiscrimination laws which includes homo and bisexuality
 One would assume it would be because politicians were listening to the people
coming up with rational arguments rather than variations on bigotry Logic
sometimes prevails
   BTW glad to see that youve admitted sexual attraction to children is a
seperate sexual orientation Didnt think you had that much honesty
