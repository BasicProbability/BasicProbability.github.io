 Besides which we dont want Clinton assasinated because that would make h
 a martyr a la JFK
 
 Its a much better deal to have him end his term of office in disgrace after
 watching all his liberal democrat friends on his staff run this nation down t
 toilet
 
 Assuming of course that the riots a fortnight from now dont do it for him

did  We didnt have riots but Bush got dumped out on his spotty Behind


Well see in 4 years
