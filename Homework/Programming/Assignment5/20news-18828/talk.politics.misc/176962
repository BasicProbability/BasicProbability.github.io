    The deficits declined from 849 reaching a low of 29 of GNP before  
 the tax and spending hike of 1990 reversed the trend

Is this true   Some more details would be appreciated

Yes sadly this is true The primary reason and the essence of the
details that you are seeking is that the GrahmRudman budget controls
were working  In fact they were working so well that unless the feds
did something they were going to have to start cutting pork So Bush
and the Democrats got together in a Budget Summit and replaced
GrahmRudman with the now historic Grand Compromise in which Bush
consented to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
increases

As it turned out the taxes killed the Reagan expansion and the caps
on spending increases were dispelled by Clinton in his first act as
President so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
increases

The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level 
ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office

Chew on that awhile
