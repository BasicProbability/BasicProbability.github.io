Subject Re Debating special hate crimes laws  was How many homosexuals

In article 1pmrakINNpunsenatorbedfellowMITEDU wdstarrathenamitedu William December Starr writes

  If someone beats up a homosexual he should get charged for assault
  and battery  Why must we add gay bashing to the list  Isnt this a
  sort of double jeopardy  Or am I just being a fascist again
  Douglas Meier

 Assuming the questions are not rhetorical the answers are

  To deter an epidemic of gay bashing that has not been deterred by
    assault laws  
  No it is not double jeopardy  A single act may lead to multiple
    charges and multiple crimes
  Yes

Lets leave aside the personalinsult potential that Doug created by
asking his last question and just concentrate on the legalpolitical
debate  Last point first yes a single act may lead to multiple
independent charges  However as a side note I think that the
prohibition on double jeopardy mandates that the suspect be tried on all
those charges at the same time in the same trial  Unless of course
the government can pull the separate sovereignties crock that theyre
using on those four LAPD cops who arrested Rodney King ie trying a
person whos already been acquitted in state court on federal charges
arising from the same act  I think that this is double jeopardy but
apparently the courts dont agree with me

Note that the laws that dont agree with you were passed to protect
a class of people who couldnt get justice from the state courts
specifically civil rights workers in Missisippi in the 60s The 
federal protection of individual rights supersedes the nonfeasance
of the state Something similar has long been traditional  well
hes queer so I beat him up for gays



You pays your money and you takes your pick me I lean strongly
towards the against argument  I know that having the law treat
everyone as equals regardless of realities will not in and of itself
lead to true equality and in fact may lead at times towards greater
inequality  Nonetheless I believe that true equality is at least
possible when the laws treat people as being equal while true
equality is by definition impossible when the laws themselves
mandate unequal treatment of classes of people by the state

As Anatole France said The law in its impartial majesty forbids the
rich as well as the poor from sleeping under bridges

Equality of law can be construed in any number of ways For example
the fact that all property thefts regardless of value are not
punished equally is an inequality which protects those who have
a lot of money from having it stolen You could easily define
equality to regard the property in terms of its significance
for the owner This would a form of equality that would be skewed
toward poorer people

In fact most antigay bashing laws are constructed to offer equal 
protection They make it an offense to damage people based on a 
motivation of hatred for sexual orientation Thus the law in its
impartial majesty protects hets as well as gays from being bashed
Im sure thats a great relief to Douglas Meier
