Subject Haiti  AIDSHIV IMMIGRANTS



     In case you missed it on the newsthe first 16 Haitians
of many that tested positive for HIV and were being held on a
base in Cuba have been flown to the US
     Further a US judge has ruled that they must receive
medical treatment or be returned to a place where they could
receive same

      So guess what folks we taxpayers get to pick up the tab 
just as you might have expected for people who have never
contributed a dime to the US society

      I think this government has its priorities ALL SCREWED UP
If they want to help Haitianshow about removing the illegal
government how about giving them development aid
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE to waste resources on dying noncitizens
who will never be productive in either this country or their own
It does not make sense when the same resources applied or even
just plain given to poor people in Haiti could significantly
help 100 people in Haiti per 1 AIDSinfected noncitizen immigrant
