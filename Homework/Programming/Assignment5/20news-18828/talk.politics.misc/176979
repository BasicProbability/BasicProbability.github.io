  This sort of separate treatment by the law has no place in an
  equal society the solution to the fact that some classes are more
  vulnerable to attack or discrimination is to do what has always
  been done in response to imbalances in criminal activity and
  citizen protection to allocate law enforcement resources to
  more efficiently and effectively deal with the problems not to
  rewrite the law itself  wdstarr

 So how do you feel about increased penalties for killing a policeman
 A federal employee  Or to use both Scalias and Stevenss example
 increased penalties for threatening the president  Im assuming
 that like all good people you oppose the marital exemption for rape
 so I wont bring that up

In order of your questions I oppose it I oppose it I oppose it and
Huh  Wha  Where did that topic come from and whats it got to do
with the discussion at hand 

When I was discussing the concept of different criminal laws for crimes
against different classes of people and yes I do consider laws which
allowmandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convicts attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category the category of classes I had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion  classes based upon race gender
ethnicity religion sexual orientation etc  Having you ask about
classes based upon ones profession rather than ones personal
characteristics caught me off guard and I had to think out the question
from scratch

What I finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others and that would be anathema
to the underlying American concept of equal treatment under the law

Last year when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fiftyplus
crimes including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that aura of deterrence critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher when the latter arguably provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society
This was an emotionally compelling argument but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their
contribution to society  I view that doctrine as being both a
personally repugnant and b repugnant to the Equal Protection clause of
the 14th Amendment

Accordingly I believe that there should be no laws which give any
professionbased class of people special protection via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class not even police officers federal officers or highranking
members of the Executive Branch of the federal government
