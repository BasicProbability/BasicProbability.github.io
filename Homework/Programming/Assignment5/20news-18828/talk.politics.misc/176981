  GovernmentMandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful 
  Study Finds

While I agree with much of this post one point seems misdirected

    When standards of living population densities and industrial
  structures are controlled for the United States is no less energy
  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group
  of Seven nations

And when controlled for usage of oil gas etc energy efficiency in
all countries turns out to be identical 

To take population density as an example one way to reduce energy
used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in
dense urban areas though this might of course have other
disadvantages possibly even relating to energy use  The fact that
Japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country while the US
is not does not mean that people in the US would be unable to do this
if given sufficient motive to conserve energy
