Subject Re Supply Siderevenue

 The result is that Clinton now HOPES to reduce the deficit to a level 
 ABOVE where it was when Reagan left office

Which considering the amount Bushcongress added to it would be a
notinconsiderable achievement

While were on the subject I also believe that the supplyside claim that
reducing taxes raised revenue is also false because they typically factor in
SocSec taxes which were raised a considerable amount at the same time that
income taxes were cut  If you look at income tax revenue alone it fell after
after the cuts began and didnt recover for several years By then record
deficits were well entrenched
 
 Chew on that awhile
