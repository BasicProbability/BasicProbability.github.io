	My motherinlaw who grew up in Germany doesnt believe in 
money at all She started out as a real estate developer and now raises
horses She keeps telling me that inflation is coming back and to lock
in my fixed rate mortgage as low as possible

If time is really hard can a bank selectively call in some mortgage
loans early  What if the bank folds can its creditors call in the
loans
