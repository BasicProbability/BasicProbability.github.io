Subject URGENT  TED FRANK WANTED FOR KILLING AJ TEEL

His account that is

Many important issues and some notso important ones are discussed here
on the net on a daily basis  I have just been informed of what I feel is
one of the most important things that we could ever discuss  The 
outandout censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people
dont like what he says or thinks

We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel  Although many of us have
not agreed with their content Im sure most of us have been at least
somewhat interested in them  I for one am greatful to live I thought
in a country where people like Mr Teel are allowed to say what they please
If I dont want to read it I can just skip on by or unsuscribe  But
unfortunately some people cannot let others live and let live  They feel
an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards  Now it seems that
Mr Teel will be with us no more due mainly to our brother and cheif
net police Ted Frank


PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET POST ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE 

                      ARE YOU ON TEDS HIT LIST  
                      ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT  
                        IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE
         HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE

I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions NOT

 
Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that 
you may understand this vial act for what it is

Organization University of Colorado Boulder
Keywords NWO Ted Frank

Well well well Thanks to eckpanixcom Mark Eckenwiler and
thf2kimbarkuchicagoedu Ted Frank my account is to be axed
I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult
for them to deal with They ONLY Ted and Mark have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net In his
defense Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups However it was not directed
at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding
via netmail

While I disagree with Ted I would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed Namecalling was not enough jumping on every post
I made was not enough ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I
AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH Even now I do not wish to have him
axed but I do wish to express my disgust about this Argumentum
ad silenceyouropponentum I would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise to himself I think

The issue that seems to be Is the following an advertisement
Apparently Ted and Mark think so

1 I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 
	off the net from last year If reposting an article
	constitutes posting an ad then I am guilty This post
	did have a name and address and yes a price If one
	had posted the address and subscription price of Newsweek
	would that be an ad I get nothing from showing this stuff
2 I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
	proof that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK He then complains
	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and lo and
	behold poof there goes my account This one had an
	address in it Oh no I Guess that means it is an ad

If you value the alternative view I have been discussing or VALUE
ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it I ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin They rarely get
Ya know that user on your net was real helpful or whatever they
only get I dont like what that user is doing because
Please do not send the note to the sysadmin I need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through

In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying Thanks for
the info or Could you send me such and such or Your posts are
very interesting keep it up and only a handfull of Go aways But
I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince Ted is a Net OffenseTM of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me Knock knockMy name is Ted and
and this is Mark Were from the thought police Seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here and were here to confiscate them
NWO Indeed

Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan Thanks Ted and Mike Hope you are happy
I will be on for a few more days and then thats all folks
Your comments and support are requested I can no longer post
to news I ask what this has accomplished Is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish Not in my book 
Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up Images of Waco ah but alas And all this when I am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction
Oh well It takes time to come up with the info requested and I
was just getting started

It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40
times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary Further what ARE Ted Franks motivations for getting me axed
We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of interest to the government and Ted sure seems
to have a personal interest in debunking me Hmmm just who does
he work for The University of Chicago which he attends is well
known as one of the biggest NWO supporters

And finally if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
in the BoulderDenver area I would greatly appreciate it I am in the
process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe
a TCIP connection Any help here would be greatly appreciated Since I
am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email VERY
soon I hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via

 As long as
 they arent causing any problems we typically dont
 mind We have received two complaints about the
 content of your messages so far at least one of which I
 consider valid  which already constitutes excessive
 in my book  Just dont let it happen again 

Editors note I wonder who the other post was from

Editors Note The reason for posting the header lines from the bounced
messages was to show what the problem was and hopefully correct it

Ted Frank Its inexcusable to post 150 lines of bounced mail headers to four
newsgroups
    A simple fourline post would have been sufficient


  Resolution

Lazlo
yes i agree BUT our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here  
makes
we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
by flaming the user into shape which i assume this is ment to be
we CS operations dont like to get involved in this stuff unless
its illegal repetitive posts of 1gig gifs harassment or something
else that offends the community in general my suggestion is that
you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look  
like or tell him to RTFM

laz
Editors note Obviously Ted had no such intention of doing so

ted frank                  However Teel should have mentioned that though 
thf2kimbarkuchicagoedu   his advice is legally sound if you follow it 
the u of c law school       you will probably wind up in jail
standard disclaimers                           James Donald in misclegal

Editors Note From this sig it seems obvious that Ted Frank has an
axe to grind Why that particular quote Hmmm Sure makes me wonder
