Why do you restrict your condemnation of racial strife to Israel
Do the situations in Bosnia Tibet China etc not merit your comment

As far as I am aware we have not sent close to 100 billion dollars to
						  
				Lets not exaggerate


I notice you did not offer an alternative number  Try this one on for
size by the year 2000 American taxpayers will have given Israel
one dollar for every star in the Milky Way Galaxy

I will let you look up the number

OK I admit I have no hard data on this Why dont you help me with this
If you would compile a commented list of all grants unrepaid loans if any
and direct aid Id be very interested to see it If you could give me
references from for example Congressional Budget Authorization Hearings
I could look them up here and Id be happy to post a verification of your
data

Otherwise Ill try my hand at this but unfortunately I wont have sufficient
time available until the end of this month so the results would be delayed

Let me know if youre interested in doing this
