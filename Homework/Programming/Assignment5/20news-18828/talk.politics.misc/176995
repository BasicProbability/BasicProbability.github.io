	I would have thought you would have found better means
of refuting or responding to the substantive points and information in
the SB 

The SB needs no refutation by me  The patent absurdity of your
beloved Great Book speaks for itself

	Your ignorance is clearly showing itself again Mark
	Why dont you read the post and show us all where the
	Silver Bulletin is wrong It is an expose of the
	corruption and fraud in government Or do you feel
	that our wonderful state is just nifty and sweet

Fine  If you think its an expose of corruption and fraud 
please prevent a jury question  Dont just reassert your 
opening statement

   	
For those in the dark I wrote to Teels sysadmin noting that a he
wastes bandwidth by posting identical messages long ones to several
newsgroups independently instead of crossposting and b he has
improperly used his posts to advertise goods for sale  
	A I was requested to post to those groups
	and they were getting deleted By whom
	B The goods for sale was a method of showing the
	source and obtaining further info
	And the message in question was retrieved in its entirety
	from the net I simply reposted it from one year ago

	Would there be a complaint if I had posted an article from
	Newsweek then posted the address and subscription price
	How about the subscription info for the American Law Review
	Bit of a double standard Yeah think so

No indication that was what happened until now  Editing down is 
always possible

    
Readers more careful than AJ will note that the complaint appended
below expressly disclaims any wish to suppress Teels postings merely
because they are infantile irrational and tedious
	More name calling Mark Is that your best shot
	Oh I see The reason for your sending that letter
	had nothing to do with your opinion of my information
	Right Clearly your motivations were the best interest
	of all of those poor users who could not speak for themselves
	If we werent talking about attempted censorshipsp it
	would be funny

	Further your perception for want of a better term is not
	the feedback that I have been getting via email and others
	 The keep it ups outnumber the Go aways at least 20 to 1

It would be interesting to hear who the responding parties are

	I for one have no intention of being a slave You may
	be so if you like Just remember where you heard that
	on Tribute Day April 15 I am not a 14th Amendment
	taxpayerslaveSSN holderetc Are you

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

Dont let the IRS see this Mr Teel

   
	And by the way the reference to UCC 1207 is made
	in pari materia with my CommonLaw Rights 1207
	is the recourse and 1103 is the remedy

And as has been noted more times than we care to count about as 
likely to stand up in court as the twentyseven eight by ten 
color glossy pictures the Stockbridge Mass police took for 
use as evidence against Arlo Guthrie  As anyone who knows 
Alices Restaurant is aware he pleaded guilty to littering was 
fined 50 and told to pick up the garbage

HOW NOT TO WRITE A DEED

One case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees jointly as 
tenants in common with equal rights and interest in said land and to the 
survivor thereof in fee simple    To Have and to Hold the same unto the 
said parties hereto equally jointly as tenants in common with equal rights 
and interest for the period or term of their lives and to the survivor thereof 
at the death of the other

The court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
joint tenancy  Germain v Delaine 294 Ala 443 318 So2d 681 1975
