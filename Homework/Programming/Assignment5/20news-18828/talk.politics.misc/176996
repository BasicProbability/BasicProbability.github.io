   	Well the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
   Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for stopping
   withholding et cetera have been out there for a while now
   	There has been no refutation to date Have the naysayers
   finally given up as defeated Sure would like to hear there reasons
   for disbelief at this point

   Probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation Ive posted
   Teel its bad enough you post this bs its even worse that you dont
   even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces but then posting
   that no ones looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
   contrary point to a severely deluded mind

What I found interesting about Conklins letter is the 
6 cases he has won against the IRS  Now assuming that
these cases really exist and were one by him anyone checked
they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim  The IRS fought
one of his deductions   Defending your deductions seems puny when
you believe that there is no need to file in the first place
