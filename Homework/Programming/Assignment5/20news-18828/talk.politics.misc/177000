Subject Re Why not concentrate on child molesters

In article 15218optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes
Yet when a law was proposed for Virginia that extended this 
philosophy to cigarette smokers so that people who smoked away
from the work couldnt be discriminated against by employers
the liberal Gov Wilder vetoed it  Which shows that liberals dont
give a damn about best person for the job its just a power
play

Of course Clayton ignores the fact that employers pay health
insurance and insurance for smokers is more expensive than for
nonsmokers
