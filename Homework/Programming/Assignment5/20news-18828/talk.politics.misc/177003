A Ney says
 of who else but President of the United States William Jefferson Clinton
Its a much better deal to have him end his term of office in disgrace after
watching all his liberal democrat friends on his staff run this nation down
the toilet

Tsk Surely you dont wish for the Democrats to destroy our beloved country
just so your party can get some trivial political advantage Thats rather
a petty way to think Not that this pettiness doesnt extend all the way
to the US Senate Ive noticed

While Bush was president I kept hoping and praying that hed wise up I
couldnt stand the man but I wish hed done a decent job if so we might
not be in the mess we are now and that would be a small price to pay for
suffering through another term of Republican control Similarily YOU should
be hoping and praying that Clinton does a good job Even if youre certain
he wont

   so I propose that we destroy the moon neatly solving that problem
Your blood pressure just went up        Mark Sachs IS mbs110psuvmpsuedu
