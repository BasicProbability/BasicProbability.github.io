The SC allows restrictions after viability a term never medically defined 
                                               

Any physician who cant make a reasonable stab at determining whether a given
fetus is viable or not is not qualified to perform an abortion 

Kebbin shows that he does not know the difference between determining
the viability of an individual fetus and providing the universally
accepted medical definitions of viability 

I was not discussing universal definitions in this post Mark Please
refrain from dragging in irrelevancies

Do you agree with my statement above about physicians being unqualified if
they cant determine viability

Since we know
that there are SOME physicians out there who are qualified to perform 
abortions then obviously SOME medical definition of viability is being 
employed 

On an case by case basis viability is relatively easy to determine

And thats good enough for the law Mark So why do you keep whining that
viability isnt defined What purpose does your whining serve
