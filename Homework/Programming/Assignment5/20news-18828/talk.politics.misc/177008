 Thought others on the net might be interested in a selection of findings
 from the New York TimesCBS News poll on national health care  Ill leave
 it to Doug Fierro to enter the entire article if he chooses  What follows
 is a selection of the findings  Paraphrased without permission  Any
 errors are mine not the Times  The NY Times doesnt make mistakes
 
 poll results deleted

The economic and political ignorance of most Americans can be truly scary
Price controls and government intervention  The surest route to
disaster  Its amazing people never seem to learn from history or
common sense  Price controls do not and cannot work  I would have
thought our last experiment in the 70s would have been enough to 
dampen the belief that price controls can actually work  As for
government intervention people never seem to get the irony of what
the are saying  We are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
of the budget and they must be controlled  We are presented with
horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies
We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
in our government run hospitals  We are just now seeing stories about
how Social Security isnt going to cut it in the future as if that
should come as any surprise  And yet people choose to ignore all
of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
the rescue  Simply amazing
