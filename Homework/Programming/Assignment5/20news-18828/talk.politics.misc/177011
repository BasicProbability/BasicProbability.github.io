Subject Re URGENT  TED FRANK WANTED FOR KILLING AJ TEEL

If the heading is true Mr Frank should be ashamed of himself

Nothing makes me gag more than people who dont respect the
rights of others to voice their opinions  My idol Lenny Bruce
once commented about that asshole Time Magazine when they
advocated censorship of his material  Time actually sided
with the cops and their arresting of Bruce at his shows
whereby he routinely would say cocksucker then the cops
would rush the stage to arrest him  My how the times havent
changed

I cant help but think of how Lenny would be received in todays
politically correct arena  Heck I even support the right of
neo nazis to speak their opinions and march down the streets

And before Mr Frank or anyone else makes any wisecracks about
antiSemitismIm Jewish a longtime member of AIPAC and the JNF
and have contributed over 1000 apiece to these fine groups  Im
a regular contributor to every proIsrael group I can find but I
still support the right of people like Arf to speak up and vomit
his propaganda

I want to know just WHO these people are 

Im basing all this on the assumption that Mr Frank did indeed
write to some sysadmin requesting Mr Teel to be admonished  If
this is not the case I hereby retract these nasties directed
toward him  If not I stand against Mr Frank and his trashing
of the First Amendment
