And Ms Regard please dont give us the trite you cant legislate 
morality nonsense again there is little else that is legislated 
including the moral concept of rights

Really Pure Socialism had this belief and fell flat on its ass by
attempting to follow such reasoning Suppose you pass a law that
states that I must love my neighbour regardless of race religion
etc How exactly do you plan to enforce such a law Better yet how
do you plan to measure compliance And even if you overcome those
two obstacles how will you ever know if I have become more moral
or not

You either missed the point or are being somewhat disingenuous  I have
never heard anyone suggest that you can legislate what people think
Laws are based on either expediency ie traffic laws or morality ie
human rights as far as I can tell and the majority are based on the
latter

Once more around the racetrack See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people They may make us act in a moral
manner but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not Perhaps the distinction is too fine
