     Now let me get this straight After a nice long rant about
     how people need to take personal responsibility for their
     economic and social lives all of a sudden 1960s radicals
     such as me I guess are responsible for poor peoples
     lifestyles Tell me how that worksor do you think that poor
     people are just too dumb to think for themselves
     
     There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family
     and support systems in general among this nations poor
     Somehow I dont think Murphy Brownor Janis Joplinis at
     the top of any sane persons list
     
     You want to go after my generations vaunted cultural
     revolution for a lasting change for the worse try socalled
     relevant or values education Hey it seemed like a good
     idea at the time How were we to know you needed a real
     education firstI mean we took that for granted
 
 The 1960s generation were the most spoiled and irresponsible
 
 The Depression had create mothers and fathers that were determined that their
 kids would not want for anything  going overboard and creating a nation of
 brats
 
 Consider the contrast between two famous events in July of 1969
 
 Apollo 11 and Woodstock
 
 Which group had large numbers of people that could not feed themselves and
 reverted to the cultural level of primitives defecation in public etc
 
 And which group assembled took care of itself and dispersed with no damage
 no deaths no large numbers of drug problems 
 

	Wasnt Woodstock also called the biggest parking lot in
history  They rejected society and went back to nature in their
parents cars
