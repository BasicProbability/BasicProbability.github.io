 We already kill people death penalty and that costs even more
 money so you could as well complain about this extremely barbaric
 way of justice

 But the death penalty is right

 And how expensive can an execution be I mean I think rope cyanide
 for the gas or the rifles and ammunition to arm firing squads are
 affordable

 Now perhaps lethal injection might be expensive in that case lets
 return to the more efficient methods employed in the past

Oh sure the death penalty is fairly inexpensive but the trial and
sentencing can run millions


strychnine	unless you wanna cut costs by skipping the trial and
 sentencing you murderous little ratbastard

  Why as a matter of fact I was thinking of that as a way to make
the system more efficient  And the only murderous ratbastards are
aboritionists

Yeah Simons no ratbastard hes the Head Attack Puppy
