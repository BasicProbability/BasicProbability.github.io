 We already kill people death penalty and that costs even more
 money so you could as well complain about this extremely barbaric
 way of justice

 But the death penalty is right

 And how expensive can an execution be I mean I think rope cyanide
 for the gas or the rifles and ammunition to arm firing squads are
 affordable

 Now perhaps lethal injection might be expensive in that case lets
 return to the more efficient methods employed in the past

Oh sure the death penalty is fairly inexpensive but the trial and
sentencing can run millions

Thats assuming our attack puppy is willing to grant people trials in
his new order

And why the hell would I waste my time doing that

to a convicted criminal getting a death sentence

Go directly to Hell do not pass go do not collect 200
judge laughing

Hey puppy you are getting further around the bend every day But
I wouldnt miss your adolescent ravings for the world everyone
needs a good laugh now and then
