Subject Re Clintons immunization program

In article C5FJsL6IsncratlAtlantaGANCRCOM mwilsonncratlAtlantaGANCRCOM Mark Wilson writes
 On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
 his so called stimulus package
 It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
 immunizations for poor kids
 So now Clinton is claiming that the republicans are holding the health of
 poor kids hostage for blatantly political gains
 
 Aside from the merits or lack thereof of another free immunization program
 just what is such a program doing in a bill that is supposedly about
 creating jobs

Jobs  What the hell have jobs to do with it  Its another touchyfeely 
program from the new vapid administration  The fact is the major claim
made for universal immunization  that all children will be immunized 
has absolutely no validity  Several states already have UI programs have
had these programs for years The result on average their success rates
are no better than the national average  It seems that the gummint hasnt
yet figured out a way to MAKE parents bring their kids in  Yet another case
of shameless demagoguery from the new Democrats the agents of change 
 
 If Clinton is so hot to get this immunization program why doesnt he and
 the democrats just introduce it as a stand alone bill Isnt it possible
 that Clinton is the one doing the blatant political read pork manipulations
 here He is telling the republicans pass my mutibillion dollar package
 or I will go to the people and tell them that you are opposed to
 immunizing poor kids

What  Clinton using this issue for partisan gain  Do tell
 
 I have never thought highly of Clinton but stunts like this lower my
 opinion of him even further
 
 I thought one of Clintons campaign themes was that he was going to be
 a new kind of politician This kind of manuevering would have made LBJ
 proud

All together now cmon you know the words Meet the new boss Same as 
the old boss  And the chorus We wont get fooled again
