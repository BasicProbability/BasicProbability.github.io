 Can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
 not humans  They were outside our society and similar phrases that
 basically meant that they didnt have to recognized as having the same
 rights as a free person but they were never considered not human to
 my knowledge
 
 	Isnt the fact that slaves were purchased as opposed to
 	hired enough evidence that they were not thought as humans
 	Didnt the Bill of Rights provide basic freedoms to humans
 	that were not available to slaves

Not necessarily  Distinctions were made between citizens and
persons throughout the US and various state constitutions
For example free blacks had some rights of citizens but not all
the rights of citizens  Im curious if there was an additional
level of distinction made by the slave states to rationalize their
treatment of slaves or if they just ignored the theoretical
problems of slave ownership

The Bill of Rights as far as I can see does not once refer to citizens
but it makes several references to people For example Article IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses papers
and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be
violated Article V no person shall be held to answer for a capital
or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment by
a Grand Jury   nor shall any person  be deprived of life liberty
or property without due process of law Article VIII excessive bail
shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual
punishments inflicted

Now Ive never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens
arent they meant to apply equally to all persons living in the US
Whether slaves were considered not human I dont know but it seems
that a case could be made that they werent treated as people as defined
in the Bill of Rights And since the nation is nominally based on the
Declaration of Independence which states that all Men are created equal
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights
that among these are Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness
it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition
of humanity
