  I remain prochoice but when prochoicers compare abortion in a
  clinic to a religious ritual in a church you have to start wondering
  a bit if the prolife criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
  doesnt have a grain of truth to it

  Ah Clayton so I see that you have found someone new to bash  Tell
  me how many prochoicers have compared abortion in a clinic to a
  religious ritual in a church  Ill bet that youve seen overwhelming
  support for this opinion in some newsgroup or another

 No but Ive seen the comparison drawn by prochoicers in capolitics
 It is worrisome to me  But not to you
 
 1 Ive been reading capolitics for a while now and I dont recall
    seeing such a comparison

You dont read my postings very carefully Im not surprised  It
was pretty shocking and is part of why my sympathy though not
agreement with the prolifers is increasing

 2 A handful of lunatic opinions expressed in capolitics does not
    make me think that the opinion is widely held

When did I say that it was

 Clayton I wish I knew what made you tick  Your math sucks and you
 take single instances of fringe opinions and proclaim the existence of
 a pernicious trend  Theres about a quarter billion people living in
 this country  some small number of them are almost guaranteed to
 hold opinions that you and I find positively repellent  As long as
 the small number is truly a small number and as long as theyre not
 my neighbor highly likely Im not worried about it

When they hold high public office you should worry

 By the way when you cite experts remember that Carl Sagan and Paul
 Ehrlich sp are experts too  If Ive never heard of your experts
 Ill consider the source you a man who is clearly unable to master
 elementary statistics and uses of statistical inference and ignore
 them
 
 David Chase

You mean I dont come to the conclusions that your emotional
state requires
