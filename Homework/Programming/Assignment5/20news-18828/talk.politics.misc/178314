                            PRESS BRIEFING
                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS


                          The Briefing Room


1240 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I guess Im just prepared to take 
questions today
	     
	     Q	  George Bob Dole says that the Clinton 
administrations policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the 
United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that 
the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  As you know President Clinton has 
said that that suggestion is under active consideration  Obviously 
this is a tragic situation in Bosnia  And if the Bosnian Serbs dont 
come to the negotiating table in a constructive way well look 
seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo  In the meantime 
were going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in 
the UN  Were going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the 
negotiating table  But the prospect of an arms embargo is something 
the President certainly will consider if the Serbs dont come to the 
table
	     
	     Q	  How much longer are you going to give them to come 
to the table George
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were working on that right now
	     
	     Q	  Its been a long time
	     
	     Q	  On February 19th the President mentioned the value 
added tax in Ohio  And when he was asked about it later by 
reporters he said  quote  That is a radical change in the tax 
system of the United States  Its something I think we may have to 
look at in the years ahead  Questioned again about it later he 
says It is not something that is now under consideration  If we 
start considering it Ill tell you  It wasnt a trial balloon or 
anything he said  I was just discussing the tax response to a 
question  Donna Shalala quoted in USA Today this morning  quote 
 Certainly were looking at a VAT  Whats gone on
	     
	     Q	  The same with Alice Rivlin this morning
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The health care task force is 
reviewing a number of options  They havent made any decisions yet  
And as I have said from this podium time and time again were not 
going to comment on decisions that havent been made
	     
	     Q	  But you have also said from this podium time and 
time again 
	     
	     Q	  Wait a minute  Whoa Nelly  Whoa  
	     
	     Q	     that that was not under consideration
	     
	     Q	  Yes  Clinton says It is not something that is 
now under consideration  Is that no longer true
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe the working group as Ms 
Shalala says has looked at this prospect but no decisions have been 
made of any kind
	     
	     Q	  Well I know  But he said hed tell us about it if 
it was ever under consideration  I take it that now he is and he 
didnt tell us about it or 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Did he say if it was under 
consideration or if it was something to be proposed
	     
	     Q	  If we start considering Ill tell you
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  If its something to be proposed
	     
	     Q	  If we start considering it Ill tell you  
Thats a direct quote
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The task force has looked at a 
number of different options  They have not made any decisions yet  
The President has not made any decisions yet  This is  one of the 
proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and 
cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform 
the health care system  They have cast a very wide net  They have 
looked at hundreds of different proposals  probably thousands of 
different proposals  But the President has not made any decisions
	     
	     Q	  Well is the President aware of their consideration 
of this option
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if hes been briefed 
on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task 
force on this specific proposal of any kind  I dont know that 
thats gotten to his level  He started yesterday to go through with 
the task force a very wide range of decisions and I dont believe 
that thats been presented to him no
	     
	     Q	  Well hes not relying on the USA Today to tell him 
what his task force is considering in the way of taxes
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No hes going through it in a very 
deliberate fashion  There are a number of decisions that have to be 
made  I dont know that this proposal has reached that decision
making point
	     
	     Q	  If this is still under consideration thats a 
change at least from what weve been told by Dee Dee I think about 
three weeks ago or so  She said that is not an option talking 
about the  had a big argument with somebody over this so I 
remember it specifically  and said it not once but twice  Is that 
not the case
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I dont know if this has 
been presented to the President as something that is being looked at 
at some level in the task force
	     
	     Q	  It was ruled it out though  I mean unlike other 
options that youve kept in the mix this one specifically was ruled 
out
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again this is something that is 
being looked at but no decision has been made of any kind  I mean 
it doesnt  its not necessarily material until you get to the 
decisionmaking phase  The working groups are looking at hundreds of 
different options
	     
	     Q	  If it was ruled out before and its not ruled out 
now then something has changed George  Yes no
	     
	     Q	  When a guy says in February 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the working groups are 
looking at the widest possible range of options
	     
	     Q	  So somethings changed  They werent looking at it 
before theyre looking at it now
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I dont know if the working 
groups have gotten to that point yet  They are casting a very wide 
net
	     
	     Q	  How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able 
to sell  definitively rule it out as an option previously and now 
are saying that in fact it is being considered
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again the working groups are 
looking at a wide range of options  They have not 
	     
	     Q	  Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it  flatly 
ruled it out on several occasions in the past month
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont deny that  I mean those 
are the Presidents words  Those are very clear
	     
	     Q	  Subsequent to the Presidents words do you deny 
that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled 
it out
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know about the timing  I 
think what we did was refer back to the Presidents words and say 
they stand
	     
	     Q	  So dont they stand any longer
	     
	     Q	  March 25th Clinton said for the next four to five 
years it was ruled out
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well those words  the President 
did say that in February  The working groups are on a separate 
track and as I said I dont believe 
	     
	     Q	  Separate from the President
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont believe this has been 
presented to the President
	     
	     Q	  Are they considering something that the President 

	     
	     Q	  Has ruled out
	     
	     Q	     has ruled out  I mean will the President 
consider a VAT tax
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again the working groups have not 
presented this to the President  They have looked at a wide range of 
options  I suppose that if an argument is made he will clearly 
listen to it  That does not mean he has decided to do it
	     
	     Q	  Can we put this another way  In his answer in 
Ohio he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax 
system  Under those  that was the circumstance that he said it 
might be considered at some future point  Is that no longer the 
case or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I guess Im not sure exactly what 
youre asking
	     
	     Q	  He talked about the VAT in the context of a 
restructured tax system not as a specific way to finance health 
care for example
	     
	     Q	  Or anything else
	     
	     Q	  Or anything else
	     
	     Q	  It was always in the context of substituting for 
other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right
	     
	     Q	  Has that change too
	     
	     Q	  Is that still his view
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I havent spoken about those 
specific comments  I think  I can just go back to it  are the 
working groups  have they examined the possibility of a VAT  Yes 
they have
	     
	     Q	  Certainly were looking at a VAT she said
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They have examined the possibility 
of a VAT  Has it been presented to the President  Has he made a 
decision  No he has not
	     
	     Q	  What kind of a deal do you have when youve got the 
Presidents appointed task force obviously not oblivious to his 
ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line 
reform goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has 
specifically ruled out in any context other than much later and then 
goes ahead and announces that thats what theyre looking at  Is the 
President concerned about that sort of thing
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that the Presidents 
concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal 
possible  Hes concerned with making sure that they have the most 
thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives all the 
different alternatives  If a decision is made to go forward with 
something like that its certainly something the President will 
explain and justify  But no decision has been made along those 
lines
	     
	     Q	  What does it mean exactly though when the 
President rules something out  Does it mean it can get back on the 
table later if a more persuasive argument is made
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats just  thats indisputably 
true  If you  but at the same time he has not ruled it in  He 
has not made a proposal
	     
	     Q	  What makes him open to it now when he wasnt open 
to it before
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Hes certainly willing to listen to 
the argument
	     
	     Q	  Was he willing to listen to the argument for a 
shortterm tax this year and he wasnt willing to listen to it in 
Chilicothe  Hes now open to it 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The context of his comments was 
that it was not something  he wanted to be clear that this is not 
something he was proposing not something he was floating
	     
	     Q	  Not something he was considering  Those are his 
words  Its not something thats now under consideration  If we 
start considering it Ill tell you  Youre now acknowledging are 
you not that it is under consideration and 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im acknowledging that the task 
force has studied this proposal  I am also stating that the 
President has not made a decision on it
	     
	     Q	  But the door is open for the President to 
reconsider including this as part of 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Obviously the working groups are 
looking at it  Again but the President has not made a decision
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if they will make a presentation on 
behalf of the VAT to him
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know that  I assume that 
if  I dont know what stage they are it in proposing  I dont know 
that theyre going to make the conclusion that this is something they 
should present to him  I know this is something the working groups 
are looking at
	     
	     Q	  Do you understand George that none of us are 
asking these questions in context of a decision that the President 
has made only about what the President is considering
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I understand that and I am 
acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a 
VAT
	     
	     Q	  And the President will consider it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I assume that he will consider the 
argument if it is presented to him
	     
	     Q	  Does that mean the President  that working groups 
think that when the President says no he means maybe  Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that means that the working 
groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible
	     
	     Q	  George can I ask you another question about 
Bosnia
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sure  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  No he wants us to stay on this
	     
	     Q	  Lets do gays in the military  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  No he got out of that swamp
	     
	     Q	  I think weve gotten the bottom line on that VAT  
Reggie Bartholomew your Special Ambassador in Belgrade today said 
that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked 
out  quote  We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the 
arms embargo together with our allies  That seems to go a bit 
further than what youve just said 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sounds almost exactly what I just 
said
	     
	     Q	  Well do you accept  in other words you accept 
what Reggie 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the President has said that 
this is something thats under consideration  It is something he 
will consider if the current actions dont bring the Serbs to the 
table
	     
	     Q	  Isnt there some kind of timetable here  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes there is a timetable  Theres 
going to be a vote on the UN resolution in about 10 days
	     
	     Q	  Thats on sanctions thats on tightening the 
sanctions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats right thats sanctions  
And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure and we hope 
that that will bring the Serbs to the table  As you know Mr 
Bartholomew also met with Mr Churkin of Russia and they are also 
working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table  We will continue to 
pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option 
as well
	     
	     Q	  The question is whether theres a timetable for 
consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo 
not the sanctions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The next vote in the UN is on 
sanctions  As far as I know there are no votes scheduled on lifting 
the arms embargo  But it is something that we have discussed both 
internally and with our allies
	     
	     Q	  Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the 
US would do that  What was the point of his telling them that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well clearly I mean this is 
something thats under consideration and this is something that we 
take quite seriously if they do not come to the table  They should 
know the consequences of failing to come to the table
	     
	     Q	  Have they been given a deadline
	     
	     Q	  Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing 
and it hasnt seemed to change the Serbs behavior in the least  Why 
should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo 
when so far everything thats been done has had no effect on the 
fighting in Bosnia
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I just dont accept the premise of 
your question  It has had an effect the embargo is having an 
effect  
	     
	     Q	  What effect
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  If the Serbians choose not to heed 
our warnings then they will face the consequences
	     
	     Q	  What effect has it had in Bosnia
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the effect that it has had on 
the Serbians it has tightened up  they are not getting their 
shipments through  We can brief more fully 
	     
	     Q	  In Bosnia George  In Bosnia what effect has it 
had
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well its hard to say if its 
stopped the aggression to date  That is why were continuing to 
press for the Serbians to stop  But we believe that over time we 
will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have   an effect  
Im not saying its going to happen overnight it clearly hasnt 
happened overnight  But we believe that over time the sanctions can 
weaken the Serbs  If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come 
to the negotiating table well move forward with the embargo
	     
	     Q	  Isnt there a working deadline George of the 24th 
 the same date as the UN  the scheduled UN vote  Hasnt the 
United States said along with many of the other NATO allies that if 
the Serbs arent willing to sign on to the peace accord by then that 
well seek  havent we said that we will seek 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Weve said continually were going 
to 
	     
	     Q	  But on that deadline
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont have a specific date but 
were going to move forward with the resolution the UN resolution 
by around that time  And if that fails to take effect if that fails 
to bring the Serbs to the table we will clearly consider other 
actions
	     
	     Q	  Isnt this awfully incremental
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were taking a stepbystep 
approach  Were ratcheting up the pressure and were going to 
continue to do that
	     
	     Q	  Is there a possibility George that by the time 
all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved 
their goals and then whats the purpose
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the purpose is to get the 
Serbs to stop the aggression  We are pursuing that goal on many 
different fronts  We are pursuing it through the UN were 
pursuing it through direct talks we are pursuing it through 
tightening the sanctions  And we will consider lifting the arms 
embargo  We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will 
continue to do that
	     
	     Q	  But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in 
getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any 
campaign be to have the Serbs give back what theyve gained  I mean 
once theyre entrenched 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I cant speculate on that  Were 
going to continue to press for them to come to the table now  Were 
going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression  But I cant 
see into the future
	     
	     Q	  George on the stimulus package House Republicans 
say theyre going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to 
try and explain the details of your package  They cite polls which 
show that the more people learn about it the less they like it  
Whats your strategy to counter that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The strategy we have is the one 
were going to continue  As you saw the President today pointed up 
the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package 
will provide  700000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner 
cities and suburbs to do productive work  We are also going to point 
out the benefits of the highway money the investments in highways  
Were going to point up the benefits of immunization  Were going to 
point up the benefits of Head Start  We are going to say that the 
Republicans have a choice  they can take action to create jobs or 
they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years 
	     
	     Q	  Does it concern you though that the House now 
the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The House Republicans voted against 
it before  They made a mistake then theyre making a mistake now
	     
	     Q	  George does it strike anybody in the 
administration that its a bit strong to describe as the President 
did this morning the summer jobs program as  quote  a 
reaffirmation of a promise of America
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not at all  I think its the 
promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full 
potential 
	     
	     Q	  Governmentfunded jobs
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  To give people a chance to work  
Absolutely  That is the promise of America
	     
	     Q	  I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday 
 where does 700000 summer jobs where does that figure come from
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That is on top of  I did look at 
it  There are currently 600000 summer jobs in the pipeline  This 
will be on top of the 600000 so it will be a total of 13 million
	     
	     Q	  The 700000 would be created by the stimulus 
package
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Where does that number come from  Because weve 
been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500000 
new jobs  And according to Panetta that breaks down to something 
like 200000 fulltime jobs and 150000 summer jobs
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes but the summer  thats when 
you do their fulltime equivalence  I mean 700000 individuals will 
receive jobs this summer  When you calculate it for the fulltime 
job effect you have to do  I dont know what the exact formula is
	     
	     Q	  Seven hundred thousand parttime jobs 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   150000 or 
	     
	     Q	  One to four because its three months
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thank you
	     
	     Q	  Can I follow up on that  Did the President 
misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money 
for these summer jobs will pay for private  for kids to work in the 
private sector
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not necessarily  I mean I think 
that there will be grants available  Thats one of the ways that you 
pay for the jobs  At the same time hes also issued a challenge to 
the private sector to hire kids on their own as well  
	     
	     Q	  Tax dollars for instance would pay for kids to 
work at TimeWarner
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the TimeWarner is actually 
somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant  Thats going to 
be the bulk of it  There could be isolated instances though where 
there would be grants to businesses
	     
	     Q	  Has the President spoken with any Senate 
Republicans this week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  
No but theres been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the 
White House
	     
	     Q	  At a lower level  But the President hasnt
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has not no
	     
	     Q	  Getting any closer to get the votes
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were continuing to work on it 
	     
	     Q	  Anybody leaning your way
	     
	     Q	  On Haiti The New York Times seems to be reporting 
something of a breakthrough in Aristides attitude towards the coup 
leaders  Can you confirm that there has been this change and what 
impact will it have on the process  And what did Pezzullo have to 
say yesterday in his report
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Pezzullo did brief the principals  
I cant confirm whats actually happening in the talks  I would 
leave that to the negotiators themselves  But Mr Caputo has 
returned to Haiti  We have received a briefing here at the White 
House from Ambassador Pezzullo  And as we have said time and time 
again we believe that assurances of security are important to a 
final resolution to a broader political settlement
	     
	     Q	  George yesterday you offered some selective 
breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities  
Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be 
impacted
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we have it for most states 
yes  And I think we can get it out
	     
	     Q	  Could you make that generally available
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I believe we can
	     
	     Q	  And could you do it by the component of the 
stimulus  In other words 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if we can do  I know 
that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs  I dont know how 
deeply it can be broken down  But clearly we can break it down into 
summer jobs and other jobs
	     
	     Q	  And can I follow up  Is this the information that 
Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the 
states
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if theyre ads but 
theyre press releases
	     
	     Q	  Can you describe what those press releases contain
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  All were doing is pointing out the 
benefits of this package to various states  For instance I know 
that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire  
And I would point out that the stimulus package the jobs package 
creates 1000 jobs in Vermont  It creates 2000 jobs in New 
Hampshire  And the people of those states should remind him that 
this is important 
	     
	     Q	  Where are the releases going
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They go to the states
	     
	     Q	  To whom
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We can get them  Its no problem
	     
	     Q	  Can we get it
	     
	     Q	  Why dont you put them out here as well
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think we can
	     
	     Q	  This afternoon  Would that be possible
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Ill have to check  I dont know  
But as soon as we can
	     
	     Q	  Are you focusing these press releases on states 
where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think were trying to get as many 
as we can  Its actually quite difficult to pull this together and 
were doing our best  Were putting them out as we get them
	     
	     Q	  Why are you so closely tracking Senator Doles 
schedule
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I was just following it 
	     
	     Q	  Are press releases going along to states where hes 
visiting
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not sure  I think that 
probably there are press releases going to Vermont  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting  
Laughter
	     
	     Q	  George as the President goes about the business of 
defending whats in his stimulus package he doesnt address what 
seems to be the Republicans main point that youre funding it with 
deficit spending rather than if its so important why not come up 
with the funding for it seems to be the Republican argument  And 
how do you answer that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  What was answer is we are paying 
for it over time  And if you look at our budget we pay for this 
package over time  We believe right now the economy needs a jump
start for jobs
	     
	     Q	  Youre not claiming are you that that doesnt add 
to the deficit this year
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im saying were paying for it over 
time  I didnt say that
	     
	     Q	  I know that George  But I mean from the 
beginning the question  we do have annual budgets and things 
deficit spending will pay for that this year will it not
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  This year they clearly will  But 
over time our budget fully pays for this program
	     
	     Q	  What youre saying is that there are savings that 
would cover this if it were this year in future years
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely  Thats exactly what I 
said
	     
	     Q	  I know that but there is going to be outstanding 
debt it will add to the national debt from this year 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No were reducing the deficit by 
500 billion  514 billion over the next four years
	     
	     Q	  You mean youre reducing it below what it would 
have been
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Exactly
	     
	     Q	  In fact youre adding a very large amount to the 
national debt over the period of 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  But were reducing it far more from 
what it would have been  Thats true  
	     
	     Q	  Washingtontype reduction  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Youre getting to be a grumpy old man
	     
	     Q	  George has any decision been made about the White 
House or the Presidents participation in the gay rights march coming 
up in a week and a half
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were working on the Presidents 
schedule now  I believe hes going to be at the Senate Democratic 
retreat in Jamestown that weekend
	     
	     Q	  Will he address it by phone
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know about that  Its a 
little far out but I believe hes going to be in the Senate retreat
	     
	     Q	  So will he have the leaders in a day or two before 
the speech
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know  I would expect that 
at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups  
I dont know the schedule on it though
	     
	     Q	  Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in 
conjunction with the event
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im just not sure
	     
	     Q	  April 22nd is Earth Day  What is the President 
going to do to mark that and is it the case that he is going to sign 
the biodiversity treaty that day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I know theres been some work on 
the biodiversity treaty  I dont know about signing it that day but 
I would expect hell have a statement on Earth Day or right around 
then
	     
	     Q	  Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Id have to check with Katie 
McGinty  I just know that theres been some work done but I dont 
know exactly what
	     
	     Q	  When is Earth Day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The 22nd I think
	     
	     Q	  Why is it you know that he is going to have a 
statement on Earth Day but you dont know if hes going to have a 
statement on the gay rights march
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I said I dont know if hes going 
to meet or when hes going to meet
	     
	     Q	  Do you have a statement on the gay rights march
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont actually no  I wouldnt 
be surprised if he did though
	     
	     Q	  Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its a working visit on Friday and 
the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of 
issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and 
the trade issues between the two countries
	     
	     Q	  There was some expectations that a second aid 
package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G7 meeting and if 
I understand it hasnt happened  Why is that or whats the status 
on that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The G7 meeting is still going on 
and as you know Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked 
about the outlines of a possible package  But were going to 
continue to consult with Congress and our G7 allies on that
	     
	     Q	    We will not then make any kind of announcement 
during the twoday meeting
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The meetings not over yet  
	     
	     Q	  Is that when youre going to make one
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not ruling out the possibility
	     
	     Q	     the Presidents going to announce it tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Bentsen said that
	     
	     Q	  Yes Bentsen said it would be tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  So did Christopher
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Id have to look at that but I 
believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of 
Tokyo
	     
	     Q	  George has there been further consideration here 
about going to  sending the President out to Los Angeles
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know that theres  its 
not something weve ruled out  We dont have a date set for it
	     
	     Q	  George you all have a position or do you support 
Immigrations plan to settle 4000 Iraqi prisoners in the United 
States
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its the first Ive heard of it
	     
	     Q	  George there was a report today about the 
	     
	     Q	  Fortunately  Laughter 
	     
	     Q	     about the pace of appointments and says that 
President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions 
that people have been nominated for  Are you going to speed up the 
pace of nominations or where do you stand with it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We filled 814 of the Presidents 
appointments  And its broken down  we have 384 Schedule C 147 
noncareer SES 213 PAS fulltime  Im not sure what that means 
laughter  70 PA fulltime  And this is about the same  its 
about the same pace of President Bush  Obviously as you move along 
farther once you  each level of appointment actually has a 
multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments  So we expect 
the process to speed up  But were at the pace of Bush  Obviously 
wed like to get these done as quickly as possible  
	     
	     I would point out that the FBI background checks and the 
background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time 
than our predecessors and that is part of the holdup  But were 
working on it
	     
	     Q	  Is that because of Nannygate
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think thats an awful big part of 
it yes
	     
	     Q	  In the story this morning you were at 
approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments but way 
behind in winning confirmations
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats where the background checks 
comes into play  Thats the problem
	     
	     Q	  Thats the background checks problem  Because I 
mean you have a Democratic Senate 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No thats not the  you make the 
appointments and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all 
the forms and have the background checks done  Thats exactly where 
the problem is
	     
	     Q	  Whats the President doing this afternoon and 
whats on the plan for tomorrow
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Hes got some meetings  just 
office meetings this afternoon for the most part on a variety of 
issues that  probably a halfdozen different issues  And then 
hell be  tomorrow well have an event probably again focused on 
the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House  And 
Friday is the Miyazawa meeting
	     
	     Q	  Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow

	     Q	  Is there going to be a prebriefing regarding the 
Japanese Prime Ministers visit tomorrow
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know about tomorrow but 
well probably get something done as we usually do for these 
visits
	     
	     Q	  Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you

issues and so we asked him to come in and talk about it
	     
	     Q	  George Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords 
tonight in Vermont  Have you guys been  in contact with Jeffords at

	     Q	  And did he express his support for it now or is he 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I cant divulge the details of the 
conversation but there have been conversations
	     
	     Q	  The LA Times is reporting that abortion 
elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care 
package  Is this something the President is considering
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again 
	     
	     Q	  Along with the VAT  Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its certainly something thats 
been looked at but no decisions have been made
	     
	     Q	  What was the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The LA Times story on whether 
abortions will be covered by the Presidents health plan
	     
	     Q	  Did the President in his meeting  did you in your 
meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice solicit his advice 
about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of 
the verdict in LA
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well we certainly talked about the 
situation in Los Angeles and the longterm prospects for economic 
development and other issues
	     
	     Q	  For instance did you discuss whether it would be 
helpful for the President to go there or not
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well we discussed a wide range of 
issues related to Los Angeles  That was certainly one of them
	     
	     Q	  Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in 
I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh good
	     
	     Q	     your reaction to Margaret Thatchers comments

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well weve been pushing very hard 
on a number of fronts for more aggressive action  We will continue 
to do that
