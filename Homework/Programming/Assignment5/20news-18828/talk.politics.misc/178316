  Think about it  shouldnt all drugs then be legalized it would lower
  the cost and definitely make them safer to use
 
   Yes
  
  I dont think we want to start using these criterion to determine
  legality
 
   Why not
 
 
 Where do they get these people  

  What pray tell does this mean Just who exactly is they
You mean they as in people who do not blindly swallow every
piece of propoganda they are given Or they as in NOKD not
our kind dear Or they as in an appeal to some audience
that is supposed to implicitly know and understand

 I really dont want to waste time in
 here to do battle about the legalization of drugs  If you really want to we
 can get into it and prove just how idiotic that idea is  

  Read I do not know what the fuck Im talking about and am
not eager to make a fool of myself
 
 My point was that it is pretty stupid to justify legalizing something just
 because it will be safer and cheaper

  From a pragmatic standpoint there certainly is some justification
if it is a vice people will commit anyway Shall we criminalize
alcohol again If the relegalization for alcohol were done from
anything other than the pragmatic standpoint Id be happy to hear 
about it The fact is that it wasnt

 A few more ideas to hold to these criterion  prostitution the killing of all
 funny farm patients AIDS victims elderly unemployed prisioners etc 
 this would surely make my taxes decrease

  Only the first one make any sense There is nothing to legalize
about all the rest Just in case you havent made the connection 
which I expect you havent the connecting theme in this thread is
a persons autonomy over their life and body Vice statutes serve
only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous
for the poor as Tim so eloquently put it People will however
take autonomy over their lives regardless of what the government
says
  And why pray tell is AIDS victim in snear quotes Are you of
the revisionist sort that thinks there is no such thing as the AIDS
plauge Or do they just deserve it
