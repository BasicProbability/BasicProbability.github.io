  For Immediate Release	   	     	           April 14 1993
  
  
                 TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
                        TO THE SPEAKER OF THE
                    HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
               THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE
  
  
                           April 13 1993
  
  
  Dear Mr Speaker      Dear Mr President
  
  As part of my continuing effort to keep the Congress fully 
  informed I am providing this report consistent with section 4 
  of the War Powers Resolution to advise you of actions that I 
  have ordered in support of the United Nations efforts in 
  BosniaHerzegovina
  
  Beginning with UN Security Council Resolution 713 of 
  September 25 1991 the United Nations has been actively 
  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia  The Security 
  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all 
  unauthorized military flights over BosniaHerzegovina  There 
  have however been blatant violations of the ban and villages 
  in Bosnia have been bombed
  
  In response to these violations the Security Council decided 
  in Resolution 816 of March 31 1993 to extend the ban to all 
  unauthorized flights over BosniaHerzegovina and to authorize 
  Member States acting nationally or through regional organi
  zations to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance  
  NATOs North Atlantic Council NAC agreed to provide NATO air 
  enforcement for the nofly zone  The UN Secretary General 
  was notified of NATOs decision to proceed with Operation DENY 
  FLIGHT and an activation order was delivered to participating 
  allies
  
  The United States actively supported these decisions  At my 
  direction the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to 
  all US forces participating in the NATO force for the conduct 
  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by 
  the United Nations over BosniaHerzegovina  The US forces 
  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F15 and 
  12 F18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft  
  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 800 am 
  edt on April 12 1993  The fighter aircraft are equipped for 
  combat to accomplish their mission and for selfdefense
  
  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air 
  patrol CAP stations within the control of Airborne Early 
  Warning AEW aircraft  The US CAP aircraft will normally 
  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the 
  Adriatic Sea  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching 
  the nofly zone will be identified interrogated intercepted 
  escortedmonitored and turned away in that order  If these 
  steps do not result in compliance with the nofly zone such 
  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by 
  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved 
  
                                more

  rules of engagement although we do not expect such action will 
  be necessary  The Commander of UNPROFOR the United Nations 
  Protection Force currently operating in BosniaHerzegovina was 
  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully 
  considered before the rules of engagement were approved
  
  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such 
  operations will be necessary  I have directed US armed forces 
  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional 
  authority as Commander in Chief  I am grateful for the con
  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort and 
  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward 
  toward attainment of our goals in this region
  
       	    	      	   	Sincerely
  
  
  
  
       	    	      	   	WILLIAM J CLINTON
