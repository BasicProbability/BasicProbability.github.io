Subject Re To be or Not to be  a Disaster 

In article philC5Ht85H48netcomcom philnetcomcom Phil Ronzone writes
Not at all You are apparently just another member of the Religious Left

Show me all these environmental disasters Most of them arent And the
natural disasters we have had individually far outweigh the manmade ones

Most of your socalled disasters Love Canal Times Beach TMI arent disasters
at all

So look if you want to worship trees or owls or snails or whatever fine do
so But DONT try to push the scaredness of YOUR religious off onto me

If you want to see environmental disasters go to eastern Europe or some
parts of the FSU former Soviet Union  This is because they had no
environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity
at any expense to justify their political systems  Luckily for us some
of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws  That
isnt to say that they shouldnt be modified but all I ever hear from
you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of
leftwing treehuggers intent on putting us back on horseback  Yes
there are some of those but a lot of us simply want to procede with
caution
