 the point is that this law protects no one but the
established car dealers or people with enough money to start a
fairly big operation all at once  Protecting these folks from
competition protects the rest of us from low prices and high
quality

 An excellent point  But you seem to be missing a more subtle
 point  It is not the government that should be the recipient
 of your displeasure but the established business interests
 that influence and direct government action in this case

It is the government that is preventing entry to the market  The
desire of those running established businesses to prevent or
restrict the entry of competitors is an understandable though
generally unpleasant human failing  But without a means to act
on this desire without a government with sufficient power to
restrict the options of the potential competitor the
anticompetitive desire remains just an unpleasant wish  The
government is the linchpin so we seek to disengage it so we
dont get the shaft

Once again Mark you dont specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests  As a 
leftwing big government conventional liberal Im just as willing as
you are to vote against anticompetitive regulations that favor auto
dealers  

But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents terms
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws
and a desire to eliminate legislators pay  Each strikes me as a 
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy  In fact they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite
