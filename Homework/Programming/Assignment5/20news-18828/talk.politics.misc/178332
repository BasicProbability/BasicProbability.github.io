 This past Thursday VP GOre threw out the first ball at the home opener for
 the Atlanta Braves According to the news reports he was quite loudly booed
 No Dr Norman these were not your typical beer swilling rednecks
 
 Personally I wouldnt have paid any more attention to the incident except
 that the evening news when describing the event went on to comment that
 being booed was nothing unusual since it was normal for audiences to
 boo at this point since the celebrity was delaying the start of the game
 
 What a bunch of crock I have never heard of any incident in which the
 thrower of the ceremonial ball has been booed before
 
 Dan Quayle got roundly booed in Milwaulkee last year  I was listening 
 on the radio  This was the game that Quayle told the Brewers players that
 he would like to see them play the Orioles in the ALCS

Its come to this has it  Defending Al Gore by comparing him to Dan Quayle
Id say that about says it all back to the pit with ye back to altfan
danquayle  Begone
