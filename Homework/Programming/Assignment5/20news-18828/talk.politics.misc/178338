 Isnt it wonderfull the way people can make the sadistic and indescriminate
 murder of the BaderMeinhof gang sound like altruism

Gee Phil Id remember where you are and that these people are monitoring the
   
net  Id also remember that they have about as much sense of humor as Ed
   

Damn It isnt Big Brother after all And all this time I thought that all
those revolutionaries while blowing things up and killing the odd
innocent person in the process really did love all us proles cause
everybody knows that dialectical materialism will save you even
if it has to get you killed first
What a fool Ive been
