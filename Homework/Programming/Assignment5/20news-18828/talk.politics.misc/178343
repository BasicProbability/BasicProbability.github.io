 Dunno man that sounds pretty damned unlikely to me too
 although its certainly one of the reasons Im pissed off at him
 Maybe the sample was taken entirely from my fellow memebers of the
 Cultural Elite
 
 Jason can you quote some of these poll questions
 
 Thanks

	Ive never seen CNN give out the poll questions on the air
If you sent them a letter asking for them you might get them  Heres
my guess of how part of a session might look

Question Do you approve of Clintons performance
Answer No
Questions Do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue
Answer Yes

Conclusion Clinton has a low approval rating because hes not moving
fast enough on gays in the military


	I think any group truly dedicated to reporting the news would
not use manufactured news like polls
