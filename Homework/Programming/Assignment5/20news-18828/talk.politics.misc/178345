	5440 or fight was about a territorial dispute with
	British Canada again OLD STUFF 

Uh not quite The 5440 boundary dispute is still unresolved
and Canadian and US Coast Guard vessels regularly if infrequently
detain each others fish boats in the disputed waters off Dixon
Entrance The only reason you dont hear more about it is that
its in neither countrys interest to aggravate the quarrel 
That doesnt mean that either country is prepared to back down
especially the local political representatives whose constituents
are all fishermen

Fishing rights are disputed  Between 2 nations no matter how 
friendly there is ALWAYS fishing disputes

What I was getting at was the 54 40 or fight slogan is OLD STUFF
dealing with the LAND dispute  No one is saying 54 40 or fight 
about fishing rights  The territorial dispute about the Oregon
Territory we called it is LONG resolved

Fishing rightssmall potatoes
