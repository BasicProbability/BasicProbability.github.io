 I would be upset that although abortions would continue they would be
 a lot more expensive for the rich and a lot less safe for the poor
 
 
 So now things are supposed to be legal just to keep their cost down
 and the safety factor high  
 
 Think about it  shouldnt all drugs then be legalized it would lower
 the cost and definitely make them safer to use

  Yes
 
 I dont think we want to start using these criterion to determine
 legality

  Why not


Where do they get these people  I really dont want to waste time in
here to do battle about the legalization of drugs  If you really want to we
can get into it and prove just how idiotic that idea is  

Go for it  I have yet to see anybody justify the
prohibition on drugs and the ensuing War On Drugs  In the world of
politics here on Usenet it is YOU that is crazy  ANYBODYwho gives
the matter any thought beyond reading headlinescannot justify this
atrocity this all out war on individual rights

Just TRY to justify the War On Drugs I DARE you


My point was that it is pretty stupid to justify legalizing something just
because it will be safer and cheaper
 

Once again in chorus WHY is this stupid


A few more ideas to hold to these criterion  prostitution the killing of all
funny farm patients AIDS victims elderly unemployed prisioners etc 
this would surely make my taxes decrease

The above paragraph is gibberishthat all I can make of it
