Subject Re NC vs Hunt Marine Gay Bashing in Wilmington NC verdict

In article C5HFr2CpAncratlAtlantaGANCRCOM mwilsonncratlAtlantaGANCRCOM Mark Wilson writes

So you feel that the defendents should have been convicted regardless of the
evidence Now that would truely be a sad day for civil rights

I dont know about everybody else but to me they should have been
convicted BECAUSE of the evidence which in my mind was quite
sufficient
