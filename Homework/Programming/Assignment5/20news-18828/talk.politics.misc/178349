 It is the government that is preventing entry to the market  The
 desire of those running established businesses to prevent or
 restrict the entry of competitors is an understandable though
 generally unpleasant human failing  But without a means to act
 on this desire without a government with sufficient power to
 restrict the options of the potential competitor the
 anticompetitive desire remains just an unpleasant wish  The
 government is the linchpin so we seek to disengage it so we
 dont get the shaft
 
 Once again Mark you dont specify the means through which the government
 is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests  As a 
 leftwing big government conventional liberal Im just as willing as
 you are to vote against anticompetitive regulations that favor auto
 dealers  
 
 But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents terms
 to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws
 and a desire to eliminate legislators pay  Each strikes me as a 
 particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
 interests cannot influence public policy  In fact they seem clearly
 designed to accomplish the opposite

This is similar to my saying that Clintons timber summit does little to
fix the health care problem  Look at the whole picture not just
randomly picked libertarian positions  If government is not allowed to
use noninitiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest
can influence the government to use noninitiated force on their behalf

The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which Ill address briefly  It certainly wont happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy  Statists run the education
monopoly so we have to be creative  The Advocates for SelfGovernment
reports 85 of their Seminar 1 participants embrace libertarianism
Thats the best means Ive seen yet  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance  in jest

Its amazing to me that governments around the world will try every
aspect of government control before as a final last resort after
everything else fails they will try individual liberty
