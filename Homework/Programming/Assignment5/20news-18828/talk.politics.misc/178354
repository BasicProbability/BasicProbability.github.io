Subject Re Representation of Territories Was Re The 11250000000000 lunch

              Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory

Those areas became states

Puerto Rico has the population needed to become a state  But the ethnic
mix there is such that Puerto Rico will probably never become a state

I say we cut them loose  If they dont want to become a state we
shouldnt continue to subsidize their existence
