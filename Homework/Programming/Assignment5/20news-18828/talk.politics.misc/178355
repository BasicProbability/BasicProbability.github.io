 51 Arrested for Defying Judges Order at Abortion Protest Rally
 The Miami Herald April 11 1993
 
    Circuit Judge Robert McGregors order prohibits antiabortion pickets
    within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice
    Even across the street they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
    or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic

 Several years ago Justice William O Douglas who was
 about as libertarian as you can get about freespeech 
 and similar issues wrote a majority opinion in which
 the Supreme Court turned down an appeal by a group of
 people who had been prohibited from demonstrating in
 front of their landlords home  

Do you have a cite for the case  You dont give enough
information to be able to compare the two situations
If the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music 
into the landlords home all day and night then I could
see how the opinion would be justified  But this court
order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
pictures of dead fetuses which doesnt disrupt the privacy
of anyone inside the clinic  

 He pointed out that
 people have a right to be free from speech 

Perhaps in the privacy of their homes but not on public
property  Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York
city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters 
outside his store  Patrons inside the store could hear the 
protesters asking them to reconsider shopping there  how 
is that different from the abortion protesters asking women 
to reconsider getting an abortion at a clinic  

 Harassment goes beyond
 expression to direct attack on particular persons
 in this case the workers and clients at a clinic
 Its purpose is clearly not to convey information or
 express an opinion but to intimidate and do harm to
 other others

Even if the protesters speech could be considered
harassment which it is not hate speech laws have 
generally been struck down by the courts  I dont see 
how the words dont kill your baby or abortion is 
murder could be considered harassment

 Antiabortionists have lost the battle for public
 opinion and the more psychopathic among them have
 turned to harassment arson bombing and murder to
 carry on their war  There is no reason not to 
 restrain them to protect the ordinary civil rights
 of everyone else

Some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
quietly on a public sidewalk  Yeah I could see how
that might be equivalent to bombing and murder
Uh huh  Let us know when you get a grip on reality
