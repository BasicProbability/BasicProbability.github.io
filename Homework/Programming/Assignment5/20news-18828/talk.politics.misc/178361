So  the Jury will be making its announcement at 700 AM Saturday
morning Pacific Time  1000 AM Eastern Time Why such an ungodly
hour

Maybe by making the announcement at 700 AM on the west coast
they figure all the rioters will be asleep giving the troops
time to move into place 

Since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities it was
smart not to allow Friday night for fighting sorry Elton and to
seal them for this morning  Also it allows for maximum daylight to
wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers as well as give
more preparation time

I guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting eh 

Are you a local news intern 

The Mayor of Los Angeles in a press conference about 300 AM
Saturday morning 

Actually that was 8 PM cos it was shown live on our 11 PM news
and cut into CNNs 11 Oclock Sports sorry but I didnt watch
the DevilsIslanders game  No SportsChannel 

Meanwhile following the announcement of the jurys verdict the
judge jury and assorted court personnel will be evacuated from the
building via helicopters landing on the roof of the courthouse They
cant  even walk out through the front door with their heads held
high 

We had cutovers to LAs KNBC on our WNBC and I didnt recall this
detail  But Ill not comment further on that 

Wont the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake
up later today

A netcontact in LA tells me that the alert will remain over this
weekend as some elements may find excuse over the notguilty verdicts
on three of five charges the aidingandabetting  Those acquittals
seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind
of angel that night speeding and fleeing et al  However   Another
consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on
the excessive force charges Koons for incompetance and Powell for
overreacting  both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops
interviewed that might get out of hand   Also some elements
may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops a dumb
move obviously  And Koreans are still scared and certain people
are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year

A Commander from Nassau Long Island was questioned about how his
people would have handled Rodney King and he said Wed have let
him roll around in the dirt til he got tired then handcuff him
