So  the Jury will be making its announcement at 700 AM Saturday
morning Pacific Time  1000 AM Eastern Time Why such an ungodly
hour

I guess its because the news is not what the government wanted to hear
Either the police officers have been found innocent  or  after a week 
the jury is hung  neither good news from the governments point of 
view as they desparately needed some scapegoats in Los Angeles

Wrong on both accounts

Maybe by making the announcement at 700 AM on the west coast they
figure all the rioters will be asleep giving the troops time to move
into place 

No one is a rioter until they participate in a riot which is 
unlikely to happen now

Most of the people in LA are likely to have gotten up early to 
listen to the court announcement

I guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting eh 

Sorry to disappoint you but this seems unlikely

The Mayor of
Los Angeles in a press conference about 300 AM Saturday morning in
announcing that the jury would give its verdict later this morning
just an hour away as I write this would not say what that verdict
is but I think he was told  in his press conference he said
anyone rioting will be stopped dead in their tracks 

I dont think he was told
However his statement was still appropriate

Meanwhile following the announcement of the jurys verdict the
judge jury and assorted court personnel will be evacuated from the
building via helicopters landing on the roof of the courthouse They
cant  even walk out through the front door with their heads held
high 

Jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously  It is not meant 
to be a source of pride or instant fame

Wont the rioters have a surprise waiting for them when they wake up
later today

Well the many people who got up early to go to the court to hear 
the verdict found that justice was served  Given your dire and 
cynical predictions I imagine that it is you who will be surprised
