Im not  Im in Canada  We have far fewer shootings like this  We have
had I believe one mass murder in the last twenty years

Im not going to say we dont have our gun problems  But we do have the
worlds largest undefended boarder with one of the most gunhappy countries 
in the world  I think Canada illustrates that gun control does have an 
effect  In fact its suprising that there is any difference considering
how easy it is to smuggle a gun from the US

Yes its amazing isnt it In fact it should tell you that gun control
is NOT the reason your crime rate is low since any idiot can smuggle guns
into Canada from the US at any time

I think Paul was trying to make the point that any idiot doesnt  There are
surely some idiots who do smuggle guns but Paul seems to feel that the exis
tence of stricter gun control laws has had a deterrent effect  

       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canadas
violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the US  Our
nongun crime rate is greater than their entire crime rate  It
would seem strange to suggest that it to were the result of gun
control laws

       I think if we looked wed find very specific cultural and
enforcement reasons why the nongun rate is low as well and then
that reasons could be applied to the withgun rates as easily

Given that most
criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who
purchase them legally having more restrictions on legal possession does 
seem to have the effect of reducing gunrelated crimes  

       Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished
because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a
crime with it a silly solution it still doesnt address the
question of Canada  Which is now by the way blaming their rising
guncrime rate on the US  Strange that the border used to magically
keep the guns out but now isnt

It certainly makes
sense that it would  Well it makes sense to some of us anyway  

       The other side of the coin of course is that far illegal drugs
are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally 
Ive still not been convinced that guns a commodity which criminals
have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources
stolen either from police military or civilian we wouldnt simply
see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as
well since theres a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there

If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics you would
realize that
  our nongun crime rate is also very high so guns per se are not the issue

Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and
Vancouver BC  The nongun rates were roughly the same for both cities  The
difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gunrelated  

        And as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques
of it two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come
to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost
entirely minority related  That is the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities Blacks and Hispanics primarily while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical

        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs
nonminority percentages but failed to take into account the relative
conditions of those minorities  That there was an eqaul percentage of
nomnwhites was about as far as they went  They failed to take into
account that the nonwhites in either city were not living in the
same conditions

        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns
then wed expect that the white rates the two groups which are
arguably fairly comparative in the two cities would have a far
higher rate in Seattle  Yet the majority in Seattle is not only
not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded but slightly
lower

  violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city

Surprise  Pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty drug use disease
etc  Since rates are lower in suburbia us middle class folks can ignore the
problem


       The point is of course that many of the US innercity
problems are not mirrored in Canada  As such  if there is a condition
which is significantly different in Canada from the US and violent
crime is highly correlated to that area suggesting that gun control
is the source of Canadas low rate is highly questionable  As one
Canadian pointed out on talkpoliticsguns Canadas major gun control
in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase
in violent crime rates which have been rising steadily since  Apparently
they didnt even mirror the USs very large drop of violent crime in
the early eighties

  most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already

Post hoc ergo propter hoc  Those areas implemented gun control because of
the high rates  

       True only to a certain extent  Take Washington DC where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards  Similarly for New York

       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high
or low  Did the gun control significantly and positively impact
violent crime  Since its gone up in those areas often faster than it
was going up before you cant simply dismiss the high crime rate by
saying gun control was caused by it  Yes gun control may be instituted
to deal with high crime  But if the crime is not positively impacted you
cant continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of
that gun control since much of that crime rate increased after gun control
was implemented just as happened in Canada

Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control

       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent
of gun control

And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in 
Washington DC may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there

       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what
others did with their guns and suddenly the police found nobody would
sell to them
