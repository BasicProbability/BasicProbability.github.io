Well yes and no The Federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
difficult to determine precisely what Maddison etc were up to from them 

       There are a couple of ways to look at them  One is We want
you to support this Constitution so well say anything that we think
will appeal to you or the more straightforward This is why we think
what weve suggested in this Constitution is a good idea

       You clearly consider the former to be the primary situation

The point is that they did not make pains to point out where the consitution
may have been aginst the new yorkers interests Also they did not want
to raise opposition by basing their advocacy on unpopular principles

       Horrors appealing to popular principles  Can we perhaps as the
question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal
to the principles rather than as you appear to believe it was written
with something else in mind and propoganda put out by its supporters

       But lets be honest about something here  When was the last time
you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments

       Or are they simply propogranda  We cant know what Phill really
means because hes obviously using arguments designed to convince

       Well I know Hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist and 
probably the authoritarian extreme to Jeffersons democratic impules
But what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions
on the government if we dont consider what they wrote about the
government

I dont propose that any means exists for determining their true opinions
Thus their true opinions died with them and are of little help today

Their opinions have not the slightest bearing on the matter though only their
arguments These are true or false regardless of who said them or why 

       If theyre true or false regardles of why they were said why
on earth did you make a point of calling them propogranda  That
would seem to be irrelevent

The
difficulty that most US posters seem to have is in considering that their
arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies 

       Oh I have no argument with questioning them  I dont believe
they no longer apply but thats because I think most of them were
good arguments  Im not entirely happy about the situation because
they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time but I dont
think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them

If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to
express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary
and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required They gave their 
opinions in certain areas and have been proved right In other areas they
got it wrong They ensured that there was a mechanism to adapt and improve
the consititution this can only happen if there is a willingness to accept that
the structural problems within the US political system may require
constitutional change as a solution 

       Since the US constitution is the basis for the US political
system most changes in it would require Constitutional change  In this
particular case however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
and tradition  It only should have been made part of the Constitution 

       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords than
wed almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also
In fact they both were because the British government had much
greater power than did the American system       

In principle no in practice yes 

        In principle no  That they had less power of that they should have
had less power

The British government today is theoreticaly
dependent on the will of the Monarch By convention any monarch seeking to
exercise that power is deposed The subtly is that the Prime Minister is
not able to identify their politics with the national interest in the same
manner that US Presidents regularly do

        Phill were discusing the power of legislative houses  While
the Prime Minister is member of Parliament he is more analgous although
badly to the US President

        Now please explain to me how the US House of Representatives
is in principle more powerful than the House of Lords or the Senate
but in practice is less  Are you suggesting that the writers of the
Constitution really intended for them to be more powerful but gosh
darn the thing was ratified before they realized theyd forgotten to put
those extra restrictions on the Senate in

       I disagree  The system is not too slow it was simply designed to
handle less than it has demanded that it handle  As somebody in Washington
put it whose name I forget Congress has become everybodys city
council

One reason for that is that at every level the government is rendered unable
to come to decisions These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level
instead 

      Not at all  As any entry level political science course will tell
you people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
government to attack which presents them with the best chance of
getting what they want  With national interest groups it is simply
a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a
law rather than the states  Less people to persuade and less 
contributions to make  

      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
the Federal level  Simply because if they win that battle all the little
state battlefields are won by extension  The same extends to insurance
medicine and most other questions

      Local government has not failed in that it hasnt done what it
should but that it is dominated by local interests  Thus nonlocal
interests who want localities to abide by their rules cant get their
rules past the local government  Thus since theyve got more clout
only in the wrong place they appeal to the next higher level because
it can impose its will on the lower

      I mean lets get real here  Do we really need the Congres
of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus
and such pattern  Or that carjacking needs to be a federal as opposed
to a local crime

      The more people want the more Congress will take power to sell
it to them for their votes  I dont think the rise of special interests
is coincidence with the increased power of Congress

       Congress is more than capable of quick action and has more than
enough power and time on its hands if it confined itself to what its
original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy

If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current 
no state subsidy motto they would be better placed As it is there is
plenty of state money being handed out The problem is that it is
distributed on the basis of power in congress and not on the basis of
actual need 

       Bingo  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
need matters because political power can be concentrated at higher
levels while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
in effectiveness

In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the
other 49 states with pork  defense contracts agricultural subsidies etc
Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster

       Then why not simply leave New Yorks education to New York  I
remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable
of educating its own children if thats what they want to do  And if
you leave it to them you only have to worry about the pork in that
state  And since industries cant concentrate their political power
and wealth rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
what they want individual voices have more relative impact

       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must buy off
states but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork

       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing
but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically
wanted to avoid  Namely a concentration of power  It would seem
then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either
House in some attempt to grease the wheels  All youll get then is
a system which moves quicker to do stupid things  It would make more
sense to make more decisions at a local level

No you have to break the machine free of seizure before you can redirect it

       But why on earth should we want to redirect it  You said yourself 
that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress  If Congres
has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
national legislation within its granted jurisdiction the pork problem
is significantly reduced

The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility
to come to a decision 

       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
to action thus it the system is weighted against action  Considering
the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
enforce its decisions by force I consider bias against making those
decisions a good thing

Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid wont
work unless the lower levels are less corrupt In most cases they are worse
not better

       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a they have
more legal legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution
than the federal government and b at those lower levels power is
harder to concentrate  And c you get the benefit of not imposing
new deicisons on everybody at once  You get to see them tried out
without a national decision  Congressional action usually treats the
entire country as a whole yet even with similar problems in different
areas different solutions may be called for

       And while I often dont agree with the decisions my local
and state reps make at least I have a better option of going to
the city council and shooting my mouth off  Id much rather the
majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
Washington with half a million or more constituents

       Im curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
are more corrupt  

       I fail to see where any restrictions implied or otherwise were
placed on the veto  It could just as easily have been read as a means
to put a check on democratically popular but unwise in the executives
opinion policies  

Since we were arguing from the Federalist papers I would point to them 

       Phill you brought up the Federalist papers  We were
arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators
should be allowed to hold up a bill  You claimed the Senate was
suppose to be a far less powerful House and I contended there was
nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this
Which was when you brought up that we cant decide what the founders
wanted based on the Federalist papers  You argued against them
I never argued from them  I have primarily referred to the Constitution
which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for
the House

The 
US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work The
only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where 
the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous

       The US Constitution is a nutsandbolts document  The Delcaration
of Independence was the highbrow reasoning  There are a couple of other
examples though such as the reasoning for the power to tax and the
reasoning for the power to grant permits both in Article I Section 8

That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the 
fact of the senate If the President was meant to revise legislation then
there would be three chambers of the legislature not two Furthermore
the separation of powers would have been much less distinct 

       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something
it wasnt intended  However I also believe it is inevitable considering
the Congress own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
want them to say  Unlike most people I think we shouldnt be worrying
about the veto which is fine but of the problem in Congress which
almost necessitates its abuse

       There is no limit in the Constitution to the Presidents veto power
regarding what a bill is for  Previous Presidents have used the veto
for any number of reasons most usually having something to do with their
agenda  I am really curious how you single Bush out as the President
who abused vetos

He has the record for vetos 

       BUSH  Phill thats absurd  Bush had 37 vetos one of
which was overridden  Go read up on FDR if you think thats
anything resembling a record

       Why is it not a reasonable restriction  Because 51 Senators
is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based  If 41 Senators
feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and 
fillibuster isnt that enough to indicate theres a sufficient question
as to whether a law is a good idea or not to reevaluate it

Up to a point the fact is though that when the majority are opposed by
a minority the minority should not be allowed to win by default

       Why not  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system
against action  Historically governemnt action in the US when
dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
not been successful  When youre in a position of imposing federal
power on diverse people why should the federal government not have to
got through something more than a bare majority

       Why one earth should 51 be sufficient to enact a law which
covers 250 million people in very very diverse places and living
in radically different conditions  Why shouldnt a supermajority
be required

Because the bill at issue is a money bill relating to a short term proposal

       Now were switching from a general question of a fillibuster
to a specific bill  I dont see how it make a difference

It is not a change in the law where a presupposition in favour of the 
status quo is arguable 

       Sure its arguable  Theyre arguing it  However requiring
60 to bring it to a vote ensures that theyll have to have a good
argument  Something that isnt based solely on party lines

       Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power
to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignored  I do not
see this as a positive thing  And for all that Im sure the Republicans
are looking for pork as much as the Democrats theyve got some legitimate
objections to the legislation in question

So instead you consider a system under which the minority automatically win
to be superior

       No I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
for action  Since US history is a history of carving up population
groups and implementing piecemeal on minorities I feel minorities
should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
about  And 41 is hardly a tiny minority  I dont advocate the minority
being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing
the federal system against action
