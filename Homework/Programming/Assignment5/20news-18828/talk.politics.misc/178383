David Smith writesGranted the simple fact of holding down a job will 
improve these kids chancesof getting another job in the future but what 
inner city kid would want to holddown just one more minimum wage job when 
there is so much more money to be madedealing drugs  

What suburban kid would want to hold down a minimum wage job when there is so
much more money to be made dealing drugs

Yet somehow surburban kids do hold down minimum wage jobs  So do inner
city kids when give the chance  Any reason you think that inner city kids
are incapable of doing legitimate work

I suppose the correct answer is not family values

Spose not  Never mind  Sorry
