In article 1993Apr1521574717331m5harvardedu bordenheadcfaharvardedu Dave Borden writes
The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we dont have one now
and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
Lets axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit
