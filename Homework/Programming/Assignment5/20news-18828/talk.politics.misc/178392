       How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on
the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that
                                                               
took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

Im curious why you think that particular adjective is important


     Im curious why you took a beign statement and crossposted it to several
different news groups including something along the lines of altdiscrimination  Look Rodney King is black and large  I have several large black male friendsand they are referred to as being large black men  to their faces and by
themselves   You know Ted I have a large number of adjectives for you
but I will spare you most of them because I try not to get into personal
flame wars  Let me just say that I think your action of cross posting this
was total BS and youre trying to start some crap  Hopefully others will
see through your trite little game and not play along
