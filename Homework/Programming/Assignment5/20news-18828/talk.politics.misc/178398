 However legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to
 be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly  Plus I have never
 heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack ecstasy chrystal
 meth and LSD  The 60 Minute Report said it worked with cocaine
 cigarettes pot and heroin

Or the government could adopt the radical and probably unAmerican idea
that citizens are free to live their lives as they wish and simply
decriminalize cocaine marijuana heroin LSD etc  Please explain why
the idea of allowing recreational drugs to be bought like cigarettes
is just plain silly  After all it works just fine for nicotine


Yeah Cancer is pretty cool isnt it
