FOCUSHEALTH EIGHT MYTHS about National Health Insurance Pt II

    An office visit thats 52 in Seattle is 18 in Vancouver
    Canada  Thats because among other things theyve given their
    government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees

Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really
why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
in Canada along with France and Germany without HMOs  the NYT
has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
lower in Canada but doctors takehome pay is almost equal to American
doctors also minimal bureaucracy cos the system is sooo simple
early March

Part of the deal for using the allinsurance approach like the French
and Germans do hey why dont they criticize France and Germany  Is
it because too many people take French and German in college to make
the accusations stick  was to preserve the doctors independance
Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britains National Health Service

Youve got to remember youve got a waiting list as well but its  
not as obvious If youre poor and you dont have insurance you dont  
    go to a surgeon In the States you ration by ability to pay  

For nonlife threatening things market arguments adequately cover why
certain procedures are in scarcer demand  I have MD friends who cant
make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance
rates but because they wont get enough customers  the CMA medical
monopolys grip on doctors licencing as in the US aside  so they
must move to larger places  However this does not refute debunking
of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care as has been done in the
US by Consumers Reports health policy studies cited by Prof Dennis
E Shea on USENET CNN NYT etc

Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canadas
health insurance approach on Talkpoliticsmedicine  There is one
small error in the article not all of our hospitals are private

WOULDNT NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  
FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS  

In Canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private  
hospital rooms  so many Canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance A policy to cover all of these things runs about 40 to 40  
a month  

Of course the one thing to note is that in the CanadaFranceGermany
case private insurance offloaded the basic coverage to the public
sector  They realized they were keeping lowriskhighprofit extra
insurance for things like privatesemiprivate rooms vs ward
accomodation dental glasses etc for corporate or personal
benefits theyll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
covered for basic care

At that point they wouldnt even consider a voucher approach
to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff

  

WOULDNT FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  
ACHE AND PAIN  

People who get free treatment do go to the doctor and hospital about  
a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  
bills  

Still Canadians  who pay nothing at the doctors  have a lower  
perperson health bill than we do

It is free in that there are no deductibles nor copayments two
things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like
real health insurance  which actually it is  I know that when
working in Alberta Ontario and Quebec I was aware that I was paying
for health insurance  eg in Toronto OHIP fees were listed on my
pay stub Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time but only
annually at income tax time built into the tax rate  Only fiscal
naifs will proclaim that its free along with the Canadian Left for
that is part of their brainwashing agenda

The French do have copayments though  France Magazines Summer 
1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
coverage including a sample chart of copayment percentages  For 
130 days youre covered for 80 of the public hospital rate 100
afterward  With extra private insurance you can get into a private
hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
rate  The public insurance covers 100 beyond 30 days or the same
cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
outofpocket or according to your supplementary private insurance
Over 23rds of French have some form of extra private insurance  So
the other 30 of health costs in Europe are out of private funds not
gleaned from other taxes  The GDP figures are combined public and
private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
yield the 1314 figure for the US

ISNT THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  
AND POWERFUL TO KILL  

Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  
politically thorny in the quiet words of one advocate for a  
national plan Some 1200 firms now sell more than 192 billion in  
health insurance Theyd put up a hard fight Not only has the industry  
grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers but 
our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does  
Canadas parliamentary system

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe its
just that it doesnt cover basic care  You can opt out in Canada
and Germany but youll have to go uninsured as a result because
there are too few other people that do so  ie no market

When private insurance realized how much money theyd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someones private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  In Quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that provinces
public health insurance plan
