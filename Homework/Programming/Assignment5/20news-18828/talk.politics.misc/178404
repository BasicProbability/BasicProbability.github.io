There is never any mention of how much working Canadians have to 
pay in taxes for their free health care system  

Oh really

I know that more than 50 of an average daily workers salary goes
towards taxes in Canada mainly because of this free health care
It looks like we are pretty lucky so far

I know that when working in Alberta Ontario and Quebec I was aware
that I was paying for health insurance  eg in Toronto OHIP fees
were listed seperately on my pay stub

While Im not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
in spending health insurance isnt on the table  See our polls 
A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans our
major English newsmagazine by Decima Research  Decima president
Allen Gregg is considered one of the worlds top poll researchers
and Mulroneys Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
the face of impossible election situations  I havent had a chance
to see this years version due to our library but previous ones
before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had
shown satisfaction at 97 and switching to an American allprivate
system had support within statistical noise  The Decima polls are
considered definitive  Even the new Reform Party a breakoff of
traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly libertarian
faction hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
just a few people have to be reminded that its not free the average
CanadianEuropean is more fiscally naive than their American
counterparts on issues like these

Personally I feel that the universal health insurance approach used
in Canada France and Germany  paying to private health providers in
a nominally free market not unlike Americas minus HMOs  depends a
lot on values in those societies different from the US  The basic
health needs for life are not viewed as market but the insurance does
allow the market to address that  basic health care is not viewed on
the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it  Plenty of
room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as

Lastly there were noises about how the Canadian system was not
containing costs but in fact their system is currently bankrupt

Please explain this one hopefully in a way that Canadian readers
besides myself can understand and concur
