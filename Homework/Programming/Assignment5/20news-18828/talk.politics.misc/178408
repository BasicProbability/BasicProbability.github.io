Subject Re Help fight the Clinton Administrations invasion of your privacy

In article 9308bluecispittedu cjppittedu Casimir J Palowitch writes
The Clinton Administration wants to manage your use of digital
encryption This includes a proposal which would limit your use of
encryption to a standard developed by the NSA the technical details of 
which would remain classified with the government

This cannot be allowed to happen


It is a bit unfair to call blame the Clinton Administration alonethis
initiative was underway under the Bush Administrationit is basically
a bipartisan effort of the establishment Demopublicans and
Republicratsthe same bipartisan effort that brought the SL scandal
and BCCI etc
