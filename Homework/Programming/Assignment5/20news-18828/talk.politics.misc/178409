  A sad day for civil rights  But typical of NC unfortunately
 
 If it is typical for the principle of reasonable doubt to be upheld in
 North Carolina then I would count that in the states favor 
 
Reasonable doubt dates back to Human Rights We are now in the time of
Civil Rights Civil Rights are issued by the State with whatever strings
attached they choose as the Grantor of said rights And if that means that 
verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or 
innocence in a traditional sense so be it Being subjective rather than 
objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right and you may be 
sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while but that really is a 
small price to pay for the common good dont you think
