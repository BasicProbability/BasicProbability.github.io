    Male sex survey Gay activity low

    A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
    examination of American mens sexual practices published since
    the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 2
    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

    The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday
    by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than
    the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional
    wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report

1 So what

So there are less gays then the gays claim

Last I checked I was one person I havent even been elected
as a representative for gaydom Should I ascribe every thing
you say as representing every member of the straight community

2 It will be interesting to see the reaction when 25million queers
   gather in Washington DC After all if there are only 6million of
   us then this is an event unprecidented in history


Dream on  Abortion and AfricanAmerican Civil rights rallies dont even bring
in half of that

Thats the point If there are several million queers in DC you had better
start wondering about the validity of the study
