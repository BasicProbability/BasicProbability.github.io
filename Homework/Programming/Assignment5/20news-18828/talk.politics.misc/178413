This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds  In this case
limited and big government are not defined  I would point out that
Lebanon Somalia and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
with limited government while the US Canada and nations in Western 
Europe where people would rather live are often pointed out as 
nations with big government from a libertarian point of view  

Well let me help by explaining the difference between a linited government
and a failed government  A limited government has its powers clearly
circumscribed  but is fully capable of enforcing its decisions within
those circumscribed areas  A failed government is incapable of
enforcing its decisions except sporadicly  Two completely different beasts

Of course one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
power and keeps it circumscribed in a complex society when it is in the 
interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
government power for their own ends  But apart from that little 
conundrum

It would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented  Now why do you suppose
that never seems to occur

 
The argument is not between those who want limited government and those
who want unlimited government  It is between those who believe
government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical 
grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds


regulation is such a vauge word  

I wouldnt call it vague  Id call it elastic  All regulation is 
not necessarily the same  By opposing all government regulation some 
libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
regulate relatively free markets as identical  Thats one reason
many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic
