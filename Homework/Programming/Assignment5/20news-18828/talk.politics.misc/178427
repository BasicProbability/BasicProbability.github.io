 The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
 draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we dont have one now
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
 on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
 Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
 Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 Lets axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

 You selfish little bastard Afraid you might have to sacrafice somthing
 for your country What someone not approve a lone for you  To bad
 What is immoral is people like you and the current president who dont
 have any idea why this country still exists after 200 years
					
					This country still exists after 200 years
					because the 
					people have to be forced by the government to
					fight in foreign wars
					I dont think so
