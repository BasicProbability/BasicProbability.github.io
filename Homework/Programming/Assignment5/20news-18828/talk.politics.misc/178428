       How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on
the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that
                                                               
took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

Im curious why you think that particular adjective is important

     Im curious why you took a beign statement and crossposted it to several
different news groups including something along the lines of altdiscrimination  Look Rodney King is black and large  I have several large black male friendsand they are referred to as being large black men  to their faces and by
themselves   You know Ted I have a large number of adjectives for you
but I will spare you most of them because I try not to get into personal
flame wars  Let me just say that I think your action of cross posting this
was total BS and youre trying to start some crap  Hopefully others will
see through your trite little game and not play along  

      You still havent addressed Teds statement  Were waiting

	Yeah Im also curious as to why you felt compelled to remind us of the
guys race BTW I dont mean to imply that youre clueless or anything but
the statement was hardly benign
