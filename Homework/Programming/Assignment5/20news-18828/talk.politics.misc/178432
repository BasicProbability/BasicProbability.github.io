It would seem that a society with a failed government would be an ideal
setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented  Now why do you suppose
that never seems to occur


I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place  Constant
combat isnt particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing  Also
they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stable
society anyway 

And the reason that the Soviet Union couldnt achieve the ideal of pure
communism was the hostility of surrounding capitalist nationsUh huh
Somehow this all sounds familiar  Once again utopian dreams are 
confronted by the real world
