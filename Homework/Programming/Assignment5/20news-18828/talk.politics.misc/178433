Subject Re EIGHT MYTHS about National Health Insurance Pt II

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees
 
Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really

why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance


And maybe thats not such a good thing I also read somewhere that
it is next to impossible in Canada to litigate against the health 
systemclass action suits are nearly impossible and you cant sue
the provincial health officials at all

Since our doctors are private and the system is just an insurance
plan litigation would not involve the insurance fund  Our lawyers
do not work on contingency so that if you were to sue for malpractice
then youd better be sure of winning to cover your fees  likewise
if you were a doctor and subject of a suit its time to sweat

Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when
the fee schedule hikes are presented the politicallybent doctors
were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength
rather than diminish especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
medicine approaches like Britains National Health Service

Oh no Dont let the AMA know about this They have enough power as it 
is Ask most Americans whether theyd like the doctors lobby to get 
more powerful

A few weeks ago the president of the Canadian MA wrote a letter to
the NYT to decry a lobbyists advert repeating the same old trash
This is significant because the AMA and the CMA are interlinked
organizations and he would not have done it without the approval 
of his AMA cronies

Well yeah tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre outside
Ottawa  Theoretically its limited to service personnel but some
studies Ive heard about have suggested that about half the patients
there are civilians who not only have connections but arent urgent
at all

It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital  since
not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff
that others dont  Ottawas population is only a quarter million
if you include the surrounding counties

The problem is in a system where hospitals annual budgets are
approved by the government how do you keep political considerations
out of medical decisions  I bet that if youre an MP or MPP or good
friends with one youre put on any hospitals urgent care list no
matter how minor your problem Which is OK unless youre someone who
gets bumped off the list for some bigshot

People of influence will get their way in any system American or
European  Its the Golden Rule  he who has the gold makes the
rules 

As for annual budgets those are actually annual grants for facilities
eg mops pans etc given to hospitals of which most are private
nonprofit foundations btw I have no problem with having aggressive
forprofit hospitals like the French who use our approach  but in
the Paris region they have almost as many people as Canada does so
their market is much more diverse  The rest has to be made up for
by billings from patients who use their services

WOULDNT NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  
FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS  

In Canada provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  
care eyeglasses prescription drugs ambulance service and private  
hospital rooms  so many Canadians do end up buying some private  
insurance A policy to cover all of these things runs about 40 to 40  
a month  

Hmm How much difference would it make in the figure of percentage 
of GNP spent on health care if dentistry and optometry were included 
in the accounting   Maybe Canada spends proportionately just as much 
on health care as we do

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the 1314 figure for the US

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse

How  They are collecting premiums  and Im an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system in order to make it look
more like the real insurance that it is  The private doctors and 
hospitals will still be there after the insurance hypothically
disappears as they were there before it appeared

Bob Rae the second least popular man in Ontario warned Ontarians a
few years ago that if they didnt stop crossborder shopping in such
huge numbers the services they expect from the province just wont
be there in a few years

For one thing I think that Bob Rae is an idiot 

He didnt say so but I knew he meant the OHIP

Most of OHIP comes from separate premiums on your paycheck if you are
a player   he wants to spend our money on other things than the
health insurance  Our high taxes are high for other spending but
health insurance which is separate and optional and it is being 
spent in a nonpartisan manner by every party 

OHIP is just a health insurance plan it does not provide any kind
of health care that is up to you and your private doctors

Would the private insurers take up the slack Theyd be under no
obligation to Of course they could eventually make money again 
but if what you say is true theyd be loathe to do so and out of
practice in handling such basic services too

Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies and their parents provide full insurance down
here  Regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage  They run around patting them
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who deserve it

When private insurance realized how much money theyd make without the
risks involved in basic insurance eg neurosurgery versus deluxe
amenities eg having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on
the fritz in someones private hospital room they started to pat
themselves on the back for their social responsibility  In Quebec
last spring a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
any thoughts of privatizing routine low cost parts of that provinces
public health insurance plan

Again I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that
much power I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers didnt go 
along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because
they knew that there was a good chance of the public system going bust
in the long run and then afterwards they could clean up Okay this 
sort of contradicts what I said higher up But its another possibility
Theyd have an added bonus when arguing against government
involvement in their industryas they could then point to its failure
instead of just citing theoretical principles

I agree  they were in a winwin situation  But right now it seems
that they have won bigger when you look at how full their coffers
are  Friends from my sisters MBA class were still being flown out
for job interviews individually with insurance firms in London ON
Canadas insurance capitol a la Hartford along with generous expense
privileges this year despite the ongoing postrecession blues
