The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees
 
Lack of defensive medicine and nearabsence of malpractice is really

why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance


Then why do we really need national health insurance then 
Wouldnt it just make more sense to find some way to cut down 
on the cost of malpractice insurance

It would if malpractice and defensive medicine were the main
factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs but they arent

Although Gary is correct in noting that malpracticerelated problems are
greater in the US than Canada they by no means account for the overall
difference in health care costs  They do account for a somewhat larger
portion of the difference in physicians gross income in the two countries

Some facts  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1 of
total health care costs in the US  In 1991 according to a survey of 
physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged
paying 37 of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance  
Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985
theyve declined significantly since then  At the same time health
care costs have increased more than any period in history

As far as defensive medicine is concerned the AMA estimates that its
total impact is about 7 billion per year  Thats about 8 of the total
current INCREASE in health care costs  and the estimate is from a group
that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine
on health care

As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things however
Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification
of MDs against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their
specialties  This would eliminate most if not all frivolous suits
while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice
