How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on
the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that
                                                               
took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

Im curious why you think that particular adjective is important

Im curious why you took a beign statement and crossposted it to several
different news groups including something along the lines of 
altdiscrimination  

Exsqueeze me  I saw your original post in altdiscrimination
Your post was crossposted to three groups  My followup was crossposted
to two of those three omitting socmotss

Now instead of engaging in metadiscussion off the topic could you answer 
the question posed  If your statement is so beign you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query
