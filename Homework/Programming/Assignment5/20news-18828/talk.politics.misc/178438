OK Phil youre right So far the evidence suggests that Nixon was a victim
of overzealous underlings and Kennedy was a womanizing disgustoblob with
a dash of megalomania After crushing the CIA and FBI whos to say Kennedy 
wouldnt have created his own version of American Friendly Fascism

Unfortunately however we dont have all the evidence So far this nations
citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4000 hours of Nixons
tapes Whats on the rest of those babies Some archivists have alluded that
there is evidence to suggest that Nixon and his cronies including George
Bush were aware of the plot to murder Kennedy before he was shot in Dallas

Ask your local DA what the charges are for the above crime


And so I must ask you Phil me putz when all this shit finally comes out
when you and I are old men I would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole
up your ass and parading you down Main Street with a sign on your chest

I was an Apologist for the American Fascist Regime circa 1944  2010

Hows that for a lovely Brechtian image


There that ought to get a reaction Unless Im in his killfile this week
