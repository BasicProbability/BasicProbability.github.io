 Oh and BTW its William Jefferson Blythe Clinton

No its not and I really fail to understand the use of that name
as an insult  Do you feel that being adopted implies some sort of
moral failing

No its a sign of aristocrtic outoftouchness with the middle
class  You ask George Herbert Walker Bush about that

And thats not his full name  What then is it


Even Quayle had his honeymoon period  It lasted a full 48 hours 
after he was chosen as Bushs running mate
