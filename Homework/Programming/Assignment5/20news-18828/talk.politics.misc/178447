How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives on
the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that
                                                               
took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  

Im curious why you think that particular adjective is important

Im curious why you took a beign statement and crossposted it to several
different news groups including something along the lines of 
altdiscrimination  

Exsqueeze me  I saw your original post in altdiscrimination
Your post was crossposted to three groups  My followup was crossposted
to two of those three omitting socmotss

Now instead of engaging in metadiscussion off the topic could you answer 
the question posed  If your statement is so beign you should have no
trouble politely responding to a polite query

       Well I dont think your query was exactly polite but I will TRY to
give you a polite responce  Something atypical of the net but here it goes

       Black is a descriptive adjective that describes Mr King  From many
of the newspaper radio and tv news reports I have seen this adjective      
is commonly in front of his name  I have NEVER seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner  I did not say that
Mr King was a no good black  I do not know Mr King and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect  I used it PURELY as a 
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many  most  news people have
used it in the past


      The entire second trial was about race Ted  I dont feel compelled to
discuss Mr Kings racial background but had Mr King been white there would
not have been a second trial  You probably are saying that the beating would
not have occurred if he were white but that is an extremely difficult call
to make  It is possible the case but not definately  

      I still think your actions are crap Ted  They are far more divisive than
me using the adjective black in a nonderogenory manner  Would you have
been happier if I had used Africanamerican   If so then you really are
lost in the world of PC  You have already been instrumental in getting one
persons net access revoked and I wonder if you have sent a copy of my 
message to my sys admin with a plea that I am not worthy of posting

     The way you went about this polite inquiry makes me believe it was 
anything but
