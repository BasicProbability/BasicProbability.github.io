 A good case A FKING GOOD CASE The defense lawyer asked the victim
 questions like what kind of sexual perversions do you participate
 in  and you think he made a good case
 
 Speaking as someone whos only about six weeks and a 6900 tuition bill
 away from becoming an unemployed slob with a law degree Id really like
 to see a transcript of this trial  Id especially like to know what
 happened immediately after the defense attorney asked that question
 assuming that the reports that he did so are accurate Im not
 accusing Tom Farrell of making anything up but this is the sort of
 case that spawns garbled misquotes false rumors and urban legends like
 tribbles  Itd be nice to think that the prosecutor objected
 irrelevant prejudicial inflammatory take your pick and that the
 judge upheld the objection

I did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case  They
were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips  Immediately
after the defense attorney asked the question there was an Objection heard
in the background  The clip ended at that point so I dont know if the
objection was upheld  I cant imagine NC is that bad 

 The arresting officer said the bastards told him they did it on
 purpose and hoped the victim would die and you think the defense made
 a good case No wonder were losing  Were aparently not trying
 to win
 
 Again Id like to see the transcript Id read the latter bit of that
 in the news media the arresting officer testifying that one of the
 defendants calmly asked him about the condition of the homo and said
 that he hoped hed die but this is the first Ive heard of the officer
 testifying that one of the defendants actually said that he did anything
 at all let alone that he did it on purpose

This I didnt hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
news stories both during and after the trial  Now the we did it on purpose
thing is stretching I think it was something more likehe had it coming  If
somebody else remebers better than I on this second point feel free to
clarify
