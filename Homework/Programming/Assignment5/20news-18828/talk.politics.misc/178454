6 months In other words its BUSHS Wiretapping Initiative
 

     Youre right I bailed out in Diff Eq  Nevertheless I would 
     suggest to YOU that there is a difference between a proposed BILL
     stalled in Congress and a executive order crammed down OUR 
     THROATS   Do you disagree


	I strongly urge you to consider moving any savings you 
	have overseas into protected bank accounts while 
	you are still able
 
Have you
