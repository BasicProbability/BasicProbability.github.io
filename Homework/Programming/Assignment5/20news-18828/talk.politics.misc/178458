	If you look through this newsgroup you should be 
	able to find Clintons proposed Wiretapping Initiative
                     
	for our computer networks and telephone systems

	This initiative has been up before Congress for at least
	the past 6 months in the guise of the FBI Wiretapping
        
	bill

What kind of brainless clod posted the above garbage Would they be


     What kind of brainless clod doesnt understand the difference 
     between a PROPOSED BILL BLOCKED IN CONGRESS and an EXECUTIVE
     ORDER ISSUED BY CLINTON AND CRAMMED DOWN OUR THROATS

     
  Here let me give a remedial course in thinking

     In order to create the appearance of low interest rates Uncle Sam
     has shifted his debt from longterm to shortterm securities

     In effect Uncle Sam has transformed the Federal Goverment into
     one giant SL waiting to blow

     Shortterm rates rise   Interest payments on Deficit rise 
     Uncle Sammy has to borrow more   Causing Shortterm rates to rise

     Uncle Sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop  His options

       i Raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
       ii  Make truly unimaginable spending cuts

    Results of i  large numbers of pissedoff citizens
    Results of ii large numbers of pissedoff citizens


    Uncle Sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to preempt the use
    of communication newtworks to foster a nationwide grassroots
    uprising
