 However legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to
 be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly  Ryan C Scharfy

 Or the government could adopt the radical and probably unAmerican
 idea that citizens are free to live their lives as they wish and
 simply decriminalize cocaine marijuana heroin LSD etc  Please
 explain why the idea of allowing recreational drugs to be bought like
 cigarettes is just plain silly  After all it works just fine for
 nicotine  wdstarr

 Yeah Cancer is pretty cool isnt it

Ryan please explain how the coolness or lack thereof of cancer is
relevant to a discussion of the legalization of currently illegal
recreational drugs  For that matter please explain how its even
relevant to a discussion of currently legal recreational drugs such as
tobacco wdstarr

You said it worked so well with tobacco  I was being fascisiousI cant spell 
worth a damn

Look this is getting ridiculous first I think tobacco should be legal  
Anybody who cant see the difference between tobacco and marijuana has got to 
be high
