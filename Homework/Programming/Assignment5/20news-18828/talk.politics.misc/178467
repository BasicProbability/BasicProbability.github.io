Funny but Ive seen a LOT more than 10 or 15 seconds of that video and
I still think the police involved were guilty I dont think theres any
excuse they could POSSIBLY come up with that would make what they did
OK I dont care if Rodney King was satan himself theres just no
excuse Now whether they did it because he was black or they did it
because they wanted to beat up on somebody they were arresting is
another entirely separate question that I have insufficient information
to make any kind of conclusion about
 
 
        How about the fact that you have a bunch of cops putting their lives o
 n
 the line day in and day out who are afraid as hell of a large black guy that
 took a large amount of punishment and refused submit  Oh yeah did you watch
 the start of the video when King got UP out of his prone postion and charge
 the cops  Sorry the video cuts both was when you sit and watch it start to
 finish
 
 

I have to agree with you the police may have carried it a bit too far
but Rodney King was no angel either And I dont think ANY guilty
verdicts should have been returned Im sure you know why they handed
down guilty verdicts on two of the officers Its quite simple really
it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
think its right to riot I hate to say this but I would have liked to
see them riot with everyone prepared It would be open season if your
skin was even slightly brown

Hey my motto is you dont fuck with me or my stuff and you dont get
killed Its just that simple
