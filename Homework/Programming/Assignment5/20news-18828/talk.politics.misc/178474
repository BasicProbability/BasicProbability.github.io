Steve  youre the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
ideal proving ground  I never felt that way in the first place  Quite the 
contrary  I think a better proving ground would be someplace that already
had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression  yet had a
strong spirit of individualism and initiative  Someplace like Texas 

Mr Grinch  
 

 
And while Texas taxpayers might willingly eliminate taxsupport for UT
and TAMU Im not sure theyd support gutting the football programs

Football can pay for itself


Then theres the impact on Ross Perots fortune of eliminating the various
state supported programs where hes made his money

Why  Hes already made it  Sure nodoby else will be able to bilk
the public in the same specific ways  but why should he or I care


 
All in all Texas doesnt seem to be a very likely place for
libertarianism to take hold 
 
More likely than most places  When I was there the most important 
state issue was whether to have a state income tax or instead legalize
a popular vice for fund raising  and vice won a decisive victory

Mr Grinch

ps  Now that hes safely dead  I expect David Koresh to become the
hero of popular folk ballads  and the ATF to be generally equated with
Santa Anna
