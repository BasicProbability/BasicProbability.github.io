I couldnt disagree with you more strongly  It sounds good but in
practice it too often becomes tyranny because there are too often
conflicting ideas of what constitutes improving the human condition
Far better to let people and their organizations pursue whatever goals
they think best and let the human condition be improved by those who
are willing to do so without coercion

There will always be conflicting ideas on what constitutes improving the
human condition thats humanity You seem to believe that libertarianism
will improve the human condition by lifting all constraints and that
people will have a better chance of improving themselves in that environment
 
Let me try to put it another way  Libertarians believe that an
unconstrained environment provides the best chance of solving any
problem because it maximizes creativity  However there is never
any guarantee that a really good solution will ever be found to any
particular problem  Utopia is not an option

Utopia is a myth although we can do a lot better than what we have today
But I think that you must pitch Libertarianism as a progressive agenda
ie You can do better under our style of system

        I admire a lot of what the Libertarians stand for but you
guys are some of the worst salesmen I have ever seen And when it comes to
politics you need salesmen whether you want them or not
 
What we need are more people who agree with us know something
about marketin and are willing to both do that marketing and teach
others how to  Are you in

Im flattered by your invitation but Im afraid you have the wrong person
Although I completely agree with your civil liberties agenda Im not 
in support of your economic agenda What I DO like about the Libertarian
party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the
past I encourage you guys to continue your crusade but Im afraid I
cant ride along
