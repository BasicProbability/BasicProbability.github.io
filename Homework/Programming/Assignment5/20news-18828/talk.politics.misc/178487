Subject Re Limiting Govt Was Re Employment was Re Why not concentrate

In article C5JH23Eu8encorecom rcollinsnsencorecom Roger Collins writes

 Look at the whole picture not just
 randomly picked libertarian positions  If government is not allowed to
 use noninitiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest
 can influence the government to use noninitiated force on their behalf

Either the government has force available to it or it doesnt  The
Libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone
else uses force first  even when that first force is not directed
against the government but one of its citizens  That all being true 
what safeguards do we have against the government CLAIMING that some
initiation of force on its part is really a response  Like the burning
of the Maine the Tonkin Gulf incident or the assault on Waco

I ask this not to argue but to understand
