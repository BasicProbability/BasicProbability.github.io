 you dont specify the means through which the government
 is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests  As a 
 leftwing big government conventional liberal Im just as willing as
 you are to vote against anticompetitive regulations that favor auto
 dealers  
 
 But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents terms
 to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws
 and a desire to eliminate legislators pay  Each strikes me as a 
 particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
 interests cannot influence public policy  In fact they seem clearly
 designed to accomplish the opposite

If government is not allowed to
use noninitiated force to achieve its goals than no special interest
can influence the government to use noninitiated force on their behalf

Fine  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable
with the use of state sponsored coercion  The notion that coercion can
be virtually eliminated in a society or more properly that once it is
eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious 
consideration is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists  

For example does noninitiated force coercion include tax collection
Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned
by Adam Smith  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the
state how is the state to deal with it  Exclusively through after the
fact arbitrationlegal compulsion  


The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
which Ill address briefly  It certainly wont happen until
libertarianism is the dominate philosophy  What means do we have to
make libertarianism the dominate philosophy  Statists run the education
monopoly so we have to be creative  The Advocates for SelfGovernment
reports 85 of their Seminar 1 participants embrace libertarianism
Thats the best means Ive seen yet  We should lobby for compulsory
Seminar 1 attendance  in jest

Well I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants
is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a 
complex conflictual industrial society  Id venture to point out 
however that if libertarians couldnt convince at least 85 of a group 
of seminar participants to embrace their philosophy their 
propaganda skills need to be honed  

Frankly however it is no great trick to create a government for a 
society in which almost everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper
government policy  Once that is assumed all sorts of annoying formalities
can be dispensed with elections police etc  And as Mr Marx said
the state will just wither away  

On the way there however would you like to explain how eliminating 
virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the 
current society will help us to live happier lives Or is it like
socialism just some shortterm pain that well have to bear until 
everyone has had the benefit of reeducation through regular 
seminar training
