Subject Re The state of justice GM trial

	A judge denied GMs new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
from the fire

	Thoughts

	Its kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

On the other hand it would be kind of scary if there were never a final
verdict because a party to litigation could keep saying Oops  I forgot
to bring up this evidence and demand a new trial  You get one bite at
the apple

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
Shouldnt that be up to a jury

Its up to General Motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation
Youd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing General Motors pulled the same
stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost  Its not
as if General Motors couldnt file enough discovery motions to delay the
trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  

Define obvious bias

Shouldnt that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial

Did GM move for a new trial on those grounds  No  Perhaps they had a 
reason
