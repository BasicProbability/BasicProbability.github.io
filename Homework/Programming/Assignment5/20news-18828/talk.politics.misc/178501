But I guess one needs to know a little about the bible
christianity and american history

Mt St Helens didnt spew such crap  How do you manage
drieux day in  day out to keep it up
 
So which are you advocating
That You know Nothing About American History 
Or that You Know Nothing About the Bible
 
Is this a Restoration of the Know Nothing Party
 
Go easy on him drieux It is the right of every American to
know nothing about anything
