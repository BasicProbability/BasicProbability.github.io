Subject Who are The Rich was Re Professors Whining About Pay



Candidate Clinton promised to tax the rich and most folks thought that
was a pretty nifty idea  Then President Clinton said he wanted families
who make more than 100000 to bear 70 of the new tax burden and many
were quick to complain that their sixfigure income does not make them one
of the welltodo  Its particularly ironic to me that its in those
traditionally liberal enclaves of the Bay Area and academia where the
wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of just
regular workingclass folk

Nobody will ever admit to being rich everybodys middle class  So who
are The Rich  Well Ill throw out some stats from the 1990 Census and
let you be the judge

 that would be about 55 to 65 thousand US and that is what tenured
 professors can expect to make  For a PhD with say 10 years experience
 65000 is a lot less than what he could be making in industry  
 
 Oh  As a 12year veteran of Silicon Valley Ive seen precious few
 employment ads that call for PhDs  And 65K is hardly chump change
 its well above the median household income for the state

Bay Area average household income is in the mid40000 range  National
average is 31889  The Bay Area has nearly twice the national average
of sixfigure income households 91 vs 48  The costofliving here
may be high but I dont think its twice the national average

 In Los Angeles modest home prices can be 500000  

A 1500squarefoot tract house in a Bay Area workingclass neighborhood
goes for about 250000  I doubt that the Los Angeles market is all that
different  It would appear that this definition of modest is perhaps a
bit immoderate

 So what  Theyre no cheaper for those who are gainfully employed
 
 In California 65000 is not uppermiddleclass
 
 It depends upon your definition its clearly above average

It is more than what twothirds of California households make  Seems
to me that belonging to the upper onethird is not an unreasonable
definition of uppermiddleclass  Note that if that professors
spouse earns 35000 they become one of Clintons rich families

Heres a breakdown of national California and Bay Area household incomes

   30K  3050K   50100K  100K

US  49     24        23      4  the Census Bureau did some weird
CA  41     26        26      7   rounding heremore like 5
BA  34     25        31      9

And to add a little prespective

A minimum wage earner working 40 hoursweek makes 8840year  The poverty
line for a family of four is 15171  If they make up to twice that the
government considers them to be working poor  Say we decide to call this
the lowermiddleclass  Then how bout

3050K annual income is middleclass  50100K is uppermiddleclass
100K is rich  1000K is filthyrich  and 10000 is Bill Gates

make sense
