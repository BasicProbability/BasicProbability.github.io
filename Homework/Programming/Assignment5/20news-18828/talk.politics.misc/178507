The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with  Iran The people
there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who
they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked
attack  Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is
meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there
is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move

It is also widely stated in nonmainstream sources that the CIA had a
large part in the overthrow of the popular and popularlyelected
leftleaning Premier Mossadegh in 1953  Is this widely recognized outside
the US  I have never seen it mentioned at all in mainstream US
media  How about within Iran
