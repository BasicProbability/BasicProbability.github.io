When I heard the latest approval rating reported for Clinton I
laughed so hard I forgot the exact numbers  Maybe one of the 
Clintonettes can refresh my memory

Has his rating dropped to 48 or 49 percent  Ha HA HA HA HA

snick oh my either way its still the lowest rating any President
has ever mustered in his first 100 days since these polls started being
taken

Hum I guess this has some significance as opposed to having an incredible
drop during the last days in office Unfortuantely having a loss in the
polls during the last days of office usually means no reelection Ask

He was finished before he started
