 	A judge denied GMs new trial motion even though GM says it has two
 new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
 from the fire
 
 	Thoughts
 
 	Its kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
 denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
 to the previous ruling appear

Welcome to the conservative judiciary

 	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
 Shouldnt that be up to a jury

I think Scalias point was that you get one chance  If new information
comes out later tough  If the conviced want justice they have to hope
the governor is feeling charitable

Theres a guy on death row in Texas that was denied a new trial dispite
evidence of his inocents

 	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
 shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  Shouldnt that be enough for
 a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial
 
 	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective

It got swept away in the Reagan Revolution
