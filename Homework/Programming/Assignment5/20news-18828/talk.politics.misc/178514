 Secondly any Canadian who has worked and participates in the
 insurance its a negative option you have to explicitly decline
 it knows that the premium is deducted separately 

yes and some Americans actually have a problem with having more
of their money taken from them to pay for others health care

But note again the Canadian and German health insurance is voluntary

Not true I am required to have insurance by law the method of collection
effectively makes it a tax


 but like basic plus cable you have to tell them that you dont
want it  for example Hutterite colonies in western Canada are not
part of it Mennon and Hutter were fundamentalist Protestants from
Germany whose followers left for the New World  Mennonites are a
very diverse lot while Hutterites are similiar to the Amish  The
American idea being floated today gives you no option but to live
off the land 

the selfish bastards that they are unfortunately that number has
diminished recently but once President Pinocchio gets through
with us i hope for a reversal of trend

Well here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards Pity they
dont look at what 12 years of the ReganBush selfish Bastard ecconomy
has done to the country

Elect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves
thats why they are selfish bastards Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the
ultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle
class
