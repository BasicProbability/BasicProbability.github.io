Correct JFK was quite disgusting in that way The reports of the women that
he coerced via power of the office are now in the dozens Today wed
call for immediate resignation for that kind of behaviour
 
I guess coercing women into having sex is MUCH worse than stealing breaking
and entering rigging national elections starting secret wars that kill
hundreds of thousands and using the powers of your office for personal
gain like Nixon did NOT
 
Garrett you are a really pathetic liar

Isnt name calling fun
 
Some of your charges are arguable but most of them are obvious lies
I challenge you to present us with any evidence that Nixon stole
rigged a national election never mind elections or used the powers
of his office for personal gain

What do you think happened at Watergate What do you think they broke into
the building for It wasnt to just look around Do I have to draw you 
a picture
 
You cant because there is absolutely no evidence that any of these
events occurred

Whatever


Who said anything about panicking snapped Authur           Garrett Johnson
This is still just culture shock You wait till Ive       GarrettIngrescom
settled into the situation and found my bearings
THEN Ill start panicking  Douglas Adams
