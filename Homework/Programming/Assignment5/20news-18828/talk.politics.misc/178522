 What I see is that the media is reasonably fair but is seen as
 liberal by conservatives and conservative by liberals

Not that I think anyone cares but this pattern using other examples
of course was discussed 2000 years ago by Aristotle in
NicomacheanEthics   Note that you cant use this insight to reason
backwards eg  Since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
the liberals see the media as conservative the media are fair  though
Ive seen this reasoning implied
