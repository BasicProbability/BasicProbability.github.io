On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

I dont know where YOU live but this is not the case nationawide
Perhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to 
do so but in my area and most areas where I know people immunizations
cost 

Sorry to shatter your stereotypes


 
    In case you havent noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give 
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps
