  but like basic plus cable you have to tell them that you dont
 want it  for example Hutterite colonies in western Canada are not
 part of it Mennon and Hutter were fundamentalist Protestants from
 Germany whose followers left for the New World  Mennonites are a
 very diverse lot while Hutterites are similiar to the Amish  The
 American idea being floated today gives you no option but to live
 off the land 
 
 the selfish bastards that they are unfortunately that number has
 diminished recently but once President Pinocchio gets through
 with us i hope for a reversal of trend
 
 Well here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards Pity they
 dont look at what 12 years of the ReganBush selfish Bastard ecconomy
 has done to the country

how about what 25 years of taxandspend big government institutionalized
dependency and outofcontrol good intentions at others expense has
done to the country
 
 Elect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves
 thats why they are selfish bastards Bush and Regan gave tax breaks for the
 ultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle
 class

yeah right and Clinton is any different please
he is just a better lia i mean politician

you think Slick and his gang of elitist socialist academics will lead
us to the promised land dont hold your breath
