And like the house of lords which it is copied from it was given pretty
wide powers Unfortunately they started to use them and thus the gridlock
set in

       I wasnt aware the House of Lords had wide powers  I was under the
impression is was pretty powerless compared to the House of Commons and
certainly didnt have almost equal their powers  The Senate is restricted
only that it may not introduce bills relating to raising revenue
 
The Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords in the period in question
The stripping of the powers of the House of Lords did not occur until 1914
and David Llloyd Georges budget Even despite this the House of Lords has
considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body 
 
Just how much power does the House of Lords have now 


Who said anything about panicking snapped Authur           Garrett Johnson
This is still just culture shock You wait till Ive       GarrettIngrescom
settled into the situation and found my bearings
THEN Ill start panicking  Douglas Adams
