When are Libertarians going to draw a clear line between
themselves and NAMBLA By your own statements you were once
a member of an organization which you knew supported
exactly what NAMBLA supports namely abolishing the age of
consent Ive never supported any such organization YOU
have

While both organizations may on paper support the abolition of the age
of consent there the resemblance stops

One supports the removal of a coercive law the other a paper facade
to legitimize sexual relations with children

Whats the difference in practice

It amounts to your saying its disgusting but should be legal

or

someone else saying lets allow the parties involved to decide what is
disgusting

Or if youre like me you think that it ISNT a coercive law because
some children cant make informed consent
