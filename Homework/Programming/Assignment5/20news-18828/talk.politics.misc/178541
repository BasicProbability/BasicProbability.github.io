 Secondly any Canadian who has worked and participates in the
 insurance its a negative option you have to explicitly decline
 it knows that the premium is deducted separately 

yes and some Americans actually have a problem with having more
of their money taken from them to pay for others health care

But note again the Canadian and German health insurance is
voluntary

Not true I am required to have insurance by law the method of
collection effectively makes it a tax

Could it be because youre British Phill and living in Germany
While the EC working rules are more liberal than what we have in
the 1989 USCanada FTA theres probably a law about that having
health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here
for example

You have mentioned this once before yet both the NY Times profile on
the German sickness funds late Jan and pamphlets that my girlfriend
gives to her language students from the German consulate both say that
it is voluntary okay there were quotation marks  and that only
90 of the population is covered by the sickness funds analogous to
our provincial health insurances but not divided by provincestate

Another guy in health care policy says that the Turkish guest workers
arent covered  hes written to me a couple of times hes not a
poster  Ill ask him
