  This past Thursday VP GOre threw out the first ball at the home opener for
  the Atlanta Braves According to the news reports he was quite loudly booed
  No Dr Norman these were not your typical beer swilling rednecks
  
  Personally I wouldnt have paid any more attention to the incident except
  that the evening news when describing the event went on to comment that
  being booed was nothing unusual since it was normal for audiences to
  boo at this point since the celebrity was delaying the start of the game
  
  What a bunch of crock I have never heard of any incident in which the
  thrower of the ceremonial ball has been booed before
  
  Dan Quayle got roundly booed in Milwaulkee last year  I was listening 
  on the radio  This was the game that Quayle told the Brewers players that
  he would like to see them play the Orioles in the ALCS
 
 Its come to this has it  Defending Al Gore by comparing him to Dan Quayle

Who compared Quayle to Gore  Mark said he had never heard of any incident
in which the thrower of the ceremonial ball had been booed before  I mentioned
another incident  And if the media had a liberal bias Im sure he would
have heard of the Quayle incident

If I was to compare Quayle to anyone it most likely would be Elmer Fudd

 Id say that about says it all back to the pit with ye back to altfan
 danquayle  Begone
