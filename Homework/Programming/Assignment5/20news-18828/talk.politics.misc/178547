                           BY DEE DEE MYERS

	     
                          The Briefing Room


945 AM EDT

	     	  
	     Q	  Why was the 1000 am postponed 
	     	  
	     MS MYERS  Just due to scheduling conflicts  So as we 
put out the President will meet with the leaders of the national 
police organizations at 200 pm in the Rose Garden as opposed to 
1000 am  The only other things on his schedule today are  At 
1100 am hell meet with General Vessey who as you know is on 
his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIAPOW issue  At 
1230 pm hell have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval 
Office  And at 200 pm hell meet with the police organizations
Then from 300 pm to 400 pm hell do his weekly photos with the 
various groups
	     
	     Q	  A photo op with Vessey
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theres no coverage on the Vessey meeting
	     
	     Q	  Why
	     
	     MS MYERS  Why  Its a closed meeting  
	     
	     Q	  What about the lunch
	     
	     MS MYERS  The lunch  No theres no coverage
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with any congress people today
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing scheduled
	     
	     Q	  There are no meetings 
	     
	     MS MYERS  There are no congressional meetings today 
no
	     
	     Q	  Has the President been given any information by the 
Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report 
from Hanoi  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the 
Vietnamese on that subject
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well clearly the report is the first order 
of business  Its high on the agenda on something that theyll 
discuss  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the 
parameters of his visit to Vietnam today but the President hasnt 
drawn any conclusions about the report yet  Certainly its 
something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese 
about first
	     
	     Q	  Did the President talk with any Republican senators 
yesterday about the stimulus package
	     
	     MS MYERS  He spoke with Senator Dole
	     
	     Q	  How many times
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe once during the day and once last 
night
	     
	     Q	  What was the outcome of that
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theyre continuing to work toward some kind 
of an agreement on a jobs package
	     
	     Q	  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any 
way flexible on this
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I think were hopeful that were going 
to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate and well 
continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some 
kind of an agreement
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss the VAT tax
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont know if that came up
	     
	     Q	  Can you check that
	     
	     MS MYERS  Sure

	     Q	  So what are they  is the President offering to 
scale down his program  is that what hes trying to do buy it down 
to where Dole will sign on
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well hes trying to protect as much of it 
as he can  But its important to him to get some kind of a jobs 
package through the Senate and through Congress now  And as soon as 
we reach some conclusions on that well let you know  But at the 
moment hes continuing to consult with members of Congress 
including obviously Senator Dole
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody else
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont believe he talked to any other 
Republicans yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Is he talking to anybody today
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont think anything is scheduled but I 
wouldnt rule it out
	     
	     Q	  We were led to believe that the President called 
Mr Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the 
conversation around to stimulus package  Is that correct
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think the President has contacted several 
people on Russian aid  I think that it was always expected that the 
stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation 
he would have with Senator Dole  The primary objective of the 
conversation was Russian aid  That was the first order of business 
but it was both
	     
	     Q	  In the Presidents mind are they linked 
politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the 
stimulus package he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to 
the American people  Has he made that argument
	     
	     MS MYERS  I cant talk about specifically what 
arguments he might have made  The President is obviously committed 
to both  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people 
first  But as you know we outlined the details of additional 
Russian aid last night in Tokyo
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that the stimulus 
package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for 
Russian  to accept a vote for Russian aid
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that the President is going to 
continue to work to pass the stimulus package to pass a jobs 
package and were still hopeful that well get some kind of jobs 
package through the Congress
	     
	     Q	  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating 
now with Dole
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hes discussing options with him
	     
	     Q	  On the stimulus is it your understanding that over 
the break some Democrats themselves have left the support that they 
had earlier for the package the stimulus package
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think we still have wide support in the 
Senate for the jobs package
	     
	     Q	  But specifically that youve lost Democrats other 
than Shelby
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont believe so  There hasnt been a 
vote
	     
	     Q	  What about Kohl
	     
	     Q	  Kohl and Feingold
	     
	     MS MYERS  There hasnt been a vote yet  And well 
continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to 
bring the package to a vote because we believe that a majority of 
the members of the United States Senate support the package
	     
	     Q	  If youre werent worried about Kohl and Feingold 
why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think George pointed out a number of 
projects in a number of states that stand to be funded or to lose 
funding if this jobs package doesnt pass
	     
	     Q	  No Democrats  Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  Ill let you draw your own conclusions
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any 
other Republicans again today
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theres nothing specifically scheduled but 
again I wouldnt rule it out
	     
	     Q	  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to 
any other states today
	     
	     MS MYERS  What weve done is were in the process of 
breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state  I 
think its entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those 
up well send out press releases to the various states that suggest 
how their states would benefit from this package
	     
	     Q	  Will you share those with us
	     
	     MS MYERS  Sure  As we did yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Do you have copies of the ones you sent 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes we made those available yesterday  And 
we certainly can continue to provide them today
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee since yesterdays questions and subsequent 
stories about the VAT what further consideration of this issue has 
been given
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothings changed since yesterday  I think 
the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was 
something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he 
has not made a decision on and I dont think we have anything to add 
to that
	     
	     Q	  But he also said that business and labor groups are 
telling him they support it  Can you tell us 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that there has been  Im not going 
to speculate on who supports it  I think the President said that 
there has been some support among business and labor groups  I dont 
think he said he was directly contacted by them
	     
	     Q	  Are we to take that to mean that the administration 
has sounded out business and labor groups on this 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think theres been plenty of public 
discourse on this over the years and even recently but I dont think 
I want to add to that
	     
	     Q	  In February though the President said that this 
was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road  What 
has happened between then and now to cause this administration to 
change its mind
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think as we said yesterday it is 
something that the working groups are looking at  Theyre 
considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to 
specific options that will be covered by the Presidents health care 
plan  The President has not taken it up yet has not made a decision 
on it  And beyond that I dont have anything to add
	     
	     Q	  You havent answered the question  It wasnt being 
considered by anyone in the White House after the Presidents 
comments in February and George reaffirmed that in a briefing
	     
	     Q	  And then suddenly 
	     
	     Q	  What happened

	     MS MYERS  The working groups as we have said 
throughout we instructed to consider a wide variety of options 
acrosstheboard  And one of the things that has been talked about 
and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a valueadded 
tax

	     Q	  But the President himself took this off the table 
Dee Dee and suddenly it reappears  And this goes to the credibility 
of this administration in a way  What has happened in the meantime

	     MS MYERS  The President has not looked at this it 
hasnt been presented to him again yet  The working groups are 
looking at it as theyre looking at a wide variety of options and 
no decisions have been made

	     Q	  And it raises the question of how independently the 
task force is working

	     MS MYERS  The task force was instructed to consider 
all options and theyve taken that mandate seriously and theyre 
considering all options

	     Q	  But thats not the impression that the President 
left in February  The impression he left was that this was something 
that was longrange to be looked at 10 15 years down the road  The 
clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was 
not on the table not an option 

	     Q	  If it changes Ill tell you
	     
	     Q	  Bring him on

	     Q	  And you repeatedly referred to the Presidents 
remarks telling us that those were still in operation
	     
	     MS MYERS  Its changed and we told you  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  But thats what Alice Rivlins comments and Donna 
Shalala comments were about  I mean that seemed like an 
orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers 


	     MS MYERS  I wouldnt  no Alice Rivlins not a 
Cabinet member first of all  Second of all it was not 
orchestrated but clearly they both said yesterday and in the last 
couple of days that its something thats being looked at  We 
confirmed that yesterday  And I dont have anything to add to that

	     Q	  Is it because he has very few options

	     Q	  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon 
the task force to convince the President about  In other words has 
the President himself personally ruled it out and its now up to the 
task force to convince him to put it back on the table  Or is it in 
fact back on the table having been placed there by discussions with 
the President  

	     MS MYERS  It is not the working groups mission at 
this point to convince the President of anything  It is their 
mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and 
the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options  I 
think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that 
context and at this point hes not  that presentation has not been 
made but its something that he will hear and he has not made a 
decision on

	     Q	  They will present it to him as one of his options 
though he specifically ruled it out

	     MS MYERS  Correct

	     Q	  Dee Dee is this more than a trial balloon  Is 
this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to 
this form of taxation

	     MS MYERS  Its simply a statement of fact  The 
working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number 
of issues relating to health care reform  One of the options that 
theyre looking at is the VAT 

	     Q	  Dee Dee when the working groups were examining 
this possibility was this on the table during the same time period 
that you were telling us that it was not

	     MS MYERS  I dont know what the specific timing of 
their drafting of options is  I dont know

	     Q	  Who was telling you that it was not under 
consideration

	     MS MYERS  I was referring back to the Presidents 
comments

	     Q	  Have they discovered that the sin taxes wont raise 
enough money to fund the core benefit package

	     MS MYERS  No theres no decisions that have been made 
on how to pay for the health care plan
	     
	     Q	  Im asking whether the projections 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theres a number of options depending on how 
the plan is structured  You cant decide how much the plan is going 
to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like  And so 
you cant discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out 
until you know

	     Q	  Dee Dee weve been told that they have a computer 
models on a number of possible packages

	     MS MYERS  Correct  

	     Q	  The question is whether they have now determined 
whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest 
minimum package  That is not a very difficult computation

	     MS MYERS  It is a question that you know that were 
not going to answer until  theres a number of options being 
considered  It depends on how the package is structured  The exact 
details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for 
them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made  
	     
	     Q	  And when the President has been meeting with health 
care  his health care advisors which we are told he has been doing 

	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	     they have never once said to him these are your 
funding options including the VAT  He has never heard the word VAT 
in his 
	     
	     MS MYERS    I am not going to comment on the specific 
nature of the daily  theyre not daily but the quasiregular 
briefings
	     
	     Q	  Well you have
	     
	     MS MYERS  I have not other than to say that hes not 
considered the VAT  And I think that is a true statement
	     
	     Q	  No but you said that it has not been presented to 
him as an option
	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	  That doesnt mean he hasnt heard about it
	     
	     MS MYERS  Im not going to get into the details of 
whats discussed  I think that statement stands for itself
	     
	     Q	     specific Dee Dee  When you say he hasnt 
looked at it do you mean that he hasnt looked at it in terms of 
paying for medical coverage or hasnt looked at it in general  
Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it 
works what the advantages are the whole thing  It sounds like 
	     
	     MS MYERS  But that was  I think in Chilicothe if 
you go back to his remarks there it was a broader philosophical 
discussion of the tax structure  And I think the comments were 
generally in reference to the overall economic plan  But clearly 
its something that hes thought about in the broad context  I mean 
that was clear in Chilicothe  What Im saying is that in the process 
of the working groups its something that he hasnt considered yet  
Its something that the working groups will present to him among the 
number of options and that no decisions have been made  And Im not 
going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where 
health care issues are being discussed
	     
	     Q	  Its your statement from this podium that no 
discussion of this has taken place  You say that no option  that 
the option has not been presented to him
	     
	     MS MYERS  That is correct
	     
	     Q	  Do you stand by  does the White House still stand 
by Georges statement in March that this will not be in the proposal
	     
	     MS MYERS  No decisions have been made  We have 
nothing to add to whats already been said
	     
	     Q	  Let me follow up here  Do you stand by what Rivlin 
said yesterday that if any kind of VAT were to be used or 
considered that other changes to the tax code would have to be made 
so that it would be less regressive
	     
	     MS MYERS  Im not going to comment any further on what 
might happen if
	     
	     Q	  But do you stand by the previous conversations in 
February that if there were to be a VAT I think the President said 
youd exclude food and energy 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Im not going to comment on the specific 
structure of a decision that hasnt been made
	     
	     Q	  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalalas 
comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working 
groups
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont know specifically what 
	     
	     Q	  Could you check for us because thats a real 
important credibility question
	     
	     MS MYERS  Sure
	     
	     Q	  Since the task force was brought together this 
issue has been discussed at the beginning and throughout as one 
fairly painless way to raise a lot of money  Were you all kept in 
the dark  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month 
and a half when youve been denying that a VAT tax would be 
considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think weve said all that we have to say  
It is something the working groups are looking at  The President has 
not made a decision about it yet  And beyond that I have nothing to 
add
	     
	     Q	  Well sorry Dee Dee there are still a couple of 
questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem 
with credibility here  yours primarily  What were asking is if 
you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered 
while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not or if 
its a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading 
us
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont believe that anyone has ever come 
out here and deliberately misled you from this podium  ever ever
	     
	     Q	  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to 
indicate something  has anybody told anybody to come out 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Were not trying to shade answers or 
deliberately mislead anybody  Ive said what I have to say about 
this issue
	     
	     Q	  All we were trying to find out 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I understand what youre trying to find out 
and Ive given you the answers Helen
	     
	     Q	  Were trying to find out what changed  what made 
it an option again  Thats the 
	     
	     MS MYERS  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to investigate all options and they are doing that  
	     
	     Q	  Yes but it wasnt an option before  How can you 
investigate it if the President has taken it off the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  It is something that theyre obviously 
considering and the President has not made a decision on
	     
	     Q	  Yes but he took it off the table in February
	     
	     MS MYERS  Working groups are considering it  Theyll 
present it to the President at some point and hell make a decision
	     
	     Q	  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off 
the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  Its clearly on the table 
	     
	     Q	  Yes but he took it off the table  Did he change 
his mind
	     
	     MS MYERS  Its back on the table Bill
	     
	     Q	  Did he change his mind
	     
	     MS MYERS  He said this morning that he hasnt made a 
decision about it  He obviously knows that its on the table  Its 
something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on 
this well let you know
	     
	     Q	  So he must have changed his mind right
	     
	     MS MYERS  At some point it will be looked at  I mean 

	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee theres like two options  either he 
changed his mind or the working groups think theyre authority 
exceeds the Presidents
	     
	     MS MYERS  The working groups were given a broad 
mandate to look at all options theyve done that
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put out his income tax
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes there will be something available on 
his income tax probably later this afternoon  His return will be 
available 
	     
	     Q	  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through 
it
	     
	     MS MYERS  No nothings planned  I think someone will 
be available probably not in a briefing setting but to walk you 
through the questions
	     
	     Q	  Were used to be walked linebyline through the 
presidential tax forms
	     
	     MS MYERS  Ive seen those briefings  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Could we have one
	     
	     MS MYERS   No I dont think there will be any kind of 
a formal briefing but there will be somebody available to answer 
your questions about it
	     
	     Q	  Did they file a joint form
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  When did he file it
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe its being filed today
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee is there going to be a backgrounder for 
Miyazawa
	     
	     MS MYERS  No there will be a readout after the 
meeting
	     
	     Q	  No backgrounder today
	     
	     MS MYERS  No backgrounder today
	     
	     Q	  This is complicated stuff  We need help  
Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  We cant give you taxes and Miyazawa all in 
one day its too confusing  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of 
force in Bosnia   Theyve both said that A they never ruled it 
out and B it might be necessary now  Does that influence your 
thinking on whether or not to change your approach
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theres been no change in our policy towards 
Bosnia  We have always said that wed consider 
	     
	     Q	  But does that impact upon your decision  Are they 
people whose opinions would carry weight with you
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theyre people whose opinions carry weight 
certainly  I mean the President supports the process that theyve 
initiated  But theres been no change in our policy for Bosnia 
although were considering a number of options right now  If the 
Serbs dont come back to the negotiating table if they dont sign on 
to some kind of an agreement we will consider additional options 
which weve been saying regularly
	     
	     Q	  One followup question then  We cannot get a 
straight answer from anyone in the administration  Why do you not 
set a deadline for the Serbs  Can you tell us the strategic or 
tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table
	     
	     MS MYERS  Were continuing to put pressure on them 
every day
	     
	     Q	  Which doesnt work so 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well we think it is having some effect  
Were going to continue to tighten sanctions  As you know we 
support the omnibus resolution  We expect that to come to a vote on 
the 26th  
	     
	     Q	  You say its having an effect  can you give us 
any documentation
	     
	     MS MYERS  Id be happy to provide somebody to talk to 
you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that
	     
	     Q	  Theres been no  you have not been able to 
provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any 
effect in Bosnia  Serbia yes in Bosnia no
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that theyve had effect in Serbia 
and we think theyve had some effect in Bosnia  And again Ill be 
happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that if 
youd like
	     
	     Q	  We would like to hear from someone who can show us 
what the effect has been in Bosnia  We had the briefing on all of 
the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade but we havent 
seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting  Can you 
provide something along those lines
	     
	     MS MYERS  I will see what I can get you
	     
	     Q	  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced 
this morning  where is that money coming from
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well have to work with Congress on the 
details of that package
	     
	     Q	  So that would be new money that you would hope to 
get
	     
	     MS MYERS    Yes thats new money in addition to the 
16 billion announced in Vancouver  So I assume that you all have 
seen the 18billion package that was announced this morning in 
Tokyo by Secretary Christopher
	     
	     Q	  Isnt there a concern though about offering 
something which you have to get in Congress  I mean that was the 
concern with Vancouver you didnt want to do that
	     
	     MS MYERS  The concern with Vancouver was to do 
something immediately which required money that was already approved 
in the Fiscal 93 budget  What were looking at now is a little bit 
longerterm plan to build on top of the 16 billion that we 
announced in Vancouver  This clearly will require congressional 
approval or some of it will anyway and were going to continue to 
work with Congress to make that happen
	     
	     Q	  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by 
Congress
	     
	     MS MYERS  The President has had a number of 
conversations with members and will continue to work with them as 
this process moves forward
	     
	     Q	  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a 
fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through 
Congress
	     
	     MS MYERS  It was created in consultation with 
Congress
	     
	     Q	  In meeting with the law enforcement officials is 
that  does that have a set speech and a goal  A direction
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes the President will talk about  and 
the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the Presidents jobs 
package  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help 
give kids something to do
	     
	     Q	  Who are they
	     
	     MS MYERS  Its members or leadership from three 
organizations  NAPO which is the National Association of Police 
Organizations IBPO which is the International Brotherhood of Police 
Organizations I believe and IUPA which is the International Union 
of Police Associations
	     
	     Q	  Will the FBI chief be there
	     
	     MS MYERS  The FBI chief  No
	     
	     Q	  Or any other federal law enforcement officials
	     
	     MS MYERS  No it will be the President and these 
national law enforcement organization leaders
	     
	     Q	  Does the 18 billion announced today include the 
400 million thats in the FY 94 budget for disarmament
	     
	     MS MYERS  No  The NunnLugar money is separate
	     
	     Q	  So this would be the 700 million thats in the 
budget already plus another 11 billion
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe all of this is on top of the 700 
million already in the budget
	     
	     Q	  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or 
Fiscal 94 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well work with Congress on the exact 
funding mechanism  on exactly how this will be paid for
	     
	     Q	  This 18 billion on top of 
	     
	     MS MYERS  On top of 700 million  on top of the 400 
million NunnLugar money we announced earlier
	     
	     Q	  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob 
Dole  it was on this tranche not on the previous money he was 
calling Bob Dole
	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct
	     
	     Q	  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa
	     
	     MS MYERS  There will be a readout after the meeting 
with Miyazawa  Tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee on a totally unrelated matter some 
Republicans who are active in the US Chamber of Commerce are 
complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House 
and the Chamber of Commerce  There are  the town hall meeting the 
other night the satellite and all of this relationship
Does the White House feel that youre getting too close to these 
Chambers of Commerce
	     
	     MS MYERS  Thats an interesting charge  Laughter  
After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any 
attention to the Chambers now there are those who would accuse us of 
being too close  I think thats interesting  But no were thrilled 
by the support weve received from the national Chamber and local 
Chambers across the country and well continue to work with them on 
this and other initiatives
	     
	     Q	  Whats the status of the President thinking about 
going to this Democratic retreat
	     
	     MS MYERS  Its on his calendar  I think hell almost

	     MS MYERS  We havent figured out exactly when hell be 
there yet  
	     
	     Q	  Is it open to coverage
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I believe the whole thing is closed
	     
	     Q	  Is he going to have any kind of address statement 
anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th
	     
	     MS MYERS  Were still looking at that  We havent 
made a final decision about how well  who will make a statement or 
what 
	     
	     Q	  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing is scheduled but I wouldnt rule it

	     Q	  Theres been a suggestion that hes going to this 
retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights  or appear 
or have any involvement in the gay rights march
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I think this is something hes been 
discussing for a long time  appearing at the Senate Democratic 
retreat
