On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

    In case you havent noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps



Excuse me for sticking my nose in but any parentparents who do not allready 
immunize their children especially if it is already free dont deserve one 
frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves or public health 
care service

I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are 
slightly seperate issues but anybody who wouldnt help their kids dont 
deserve my tax help
