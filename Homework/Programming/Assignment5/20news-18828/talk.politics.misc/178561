   And now those other options dont exist  We probably agree on this
   more than you thinkwelfare was invented to solve a problem of the
   30s but the poverty is now so much worse and our economic infra
   structure has been so eroded that it just cant keep up any more
 
  You mean since your philosophy took over the economy has almost
  collapsed
 
 Excuse me my philosophy  You dont have any idea what my philosophy
 is  The American economy has had its ups and downs through a number of
 prevailing economic philosophies  But then economics is hardly a science

In my lifetime your philosophy  socialism masquerading as a liberal
welfare state  has been in ascendancy

 No I mean exactly what I wrotethe welfare system of the New Deal is
 wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs

Absolutely  So the response of socialists is take us even further
into socialism

     2 Whether or not the fathers work
     is not germane to single mothers
  
    Very true  But the promotion of casual sexuality is something that
    plays a part in the single mother problem
 
   Ill buy thatand theres lots of reasons for it extremely far down on
   the list being the flashinthepan media attention a bunch of middle
   class dropouts got for their philosophy and experimentation  
 
  Flashinthepan  No your subculture has utterly dominated the
  TV and movie industries for two decades now
 
 My subculture  My were getting personal  The only subculture I see
 dominating the TV and movie industries is money  If youll buy it
 theyll sell it  And as recent movements to boycott TV advertisers have
 shown theyre very sensitive about what sells  Whatever happened to
 personal responsibility anyway  Or am I personally responsible for
 the decline in that too

To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible
for themselves yes

    Come on  You and I both know that the major problem of this society
    today isnt a lack of employment its a lack of people willing to work
 
   Huh  Tell that to the single mother I know who was laid off from
   her 10hour job at a hospital and now works 2 fulltime minimum
   wage jobs to barely be able to support herself and her kid  Barely
   Hey shes too proud to go on public assistance but the only jobs
   she can find are menial and with no benefits  And no career path
   eitherthey find excuses to lay people off and hire new ones rather
   than give raises and perks  And why not  Its a lot cheaper
 
  Oddly enough all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage
  to find employment almost immediately  Maybe she needs to move to a
  cheaper part of the country where jobs are plentiful and the cost
  of living is lower
 
 The west side of Chicago is about as cheap as it getssqualor city
 Tell me about all these places where its cheap to live and jobs are
 abundantIll pass them on

Sonoma County

 You live in a strange and wondrous place sir  Inexpensive housing

Not exactly cheap but not Los Angeles either

 lots of employment and utterly surrounded by socialists  Well I suppose
 thats the sort of environment that would attract socialists or at least
 not dissuade them

No its that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists  all the
spoiled rich kids feeling guilty about their wealth  But not guilty
enough to give it away  they just look for politicians to take MY
more limited wealth away

   I see a lot of people willingnay eagerto work  What I dont see
   is a system that makes it at all feasible to do so  Its not just
   welfare which nobody enjoys but there just arent the jobs any more
   When the US was expanding industrial capacity there was always a mill
   to go work inskills to learn a future  Now theres only McDonalds
 
  Odd  Not the experience of anyone I know  Just the opposite
 
 In California

Yup

   Mr Cramer I was there  Hippiedom was a very lowbudget operation
   Our drugs were cheap
 
  The money I was referring to was Aid to Families with Druggie 
  Cohabitators AFDC
 
 Well I doubt that much of this goes to drugsthere isnt much left after
 buying food and there is very little in the first place  Sure you read
 about such cases now and then but thats what makes them news  Show me
 your statistics about AFDC abuse

I can tell you that relatives I have known the drugs came first the
food was secondary
