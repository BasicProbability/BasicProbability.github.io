     The fact that the South had a number of slave owners is true but
     relatively small numbers around 1200 had more than a few hundred slaves
     I have to get references that I do not have here for 
     exact numbers
 
 If it has any bearing on this discussion I saw a figure for the total
 number of slaveowners as 300000  Does anyone have a figure for how
 many slaves there were  How many farmers without slaves
