The Miami Herald April 11 1993

   Melbourne Florida    

   Circuit Judge Robert McGregors order prohibits antiabortion pickets
   within 36 feet of the property line of Aware Woman Center for Choice
   Even across the street they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
   or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic

   The protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the First Amendment
   to the Constitution

   This is our sidewalk said Joe Carroll 33 a landscaper who
   marched with his children Mary Grace 8 and John 7

   I am not a rescuer  I am not a trespasser  Its just that this is
   my sidewalk  I am not really protesting abortion  We are protesting
   denial of our rights of assembly religion speech  This judge is
   trashing the Constitution

   The childrens grandmother led them away sobbing as Carroll and
   his father were arrested

   Outside the clinic Eleanor Smeal president of the Washington
   DCbased Feminist Majority Foundation called for the Florida
   Legislature and Congress to pass laws as tough as the judges
   order which covers only Brevard and Seminole counties

   This cannot go on she said  This is not freedom of speech
   this is total psychological warfare with violence  It is ridiculous
   to have to ask clinics to go courtbycourt    to get protection
