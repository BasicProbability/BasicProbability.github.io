 EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE
 
 By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer
 
 SAN FRANCISCO  Police on Thursday served search warrants on the
 AntiDefamation League here and in Los Angeles seizing evidence of a
 nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than
 950 political groups newspapers and labor unions and as many as
 12000 people
 
 Describing the spy operation in great detail San Francisco
 authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how
 operatives of the AntiDefamation League searched through trash and
 infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on ArabAmerican
 rightwing and what they called pinko organizations
 
 Representatives of the AntiDefamation League a wellknown
 organization in the US Jewish community dedicated to fighting
 antiSemitism declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking
 any laws
 
 Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to
 gather political intelligence in at least seven cities including Los
 Angeles and San Francisco
 
 Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political
 spectrum including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan the White Aryan
 Resistance Operation Rescue Greenpeace the National Assn for the
 Advancement of Colored People the United Farm Workers and the Jewish
 Defense League  Also on the list were Mills College the board of
 directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San
 Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper
 
 People who were subjects of the spy operation included former
 Republican Rep Pete McCloskey jailed political extremist Lyndon H
 LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft who
 is based in South Africa
 
 Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was
 confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement
 agencies  They also alleged that data on some individuals and
 organizations was sold separately to the South African government
 
 In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from
 police the AntiDefamation League could face a total of 48 felony
 counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West
 Coast spy Roy Bullock according to the affidavit filed to justify
 the search warrant
 
 The AntiDefamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than
 25 years by funneling 550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I
 Hochman who then paid Bullock according to the documents released in
 San Francisco  Hochman a former president of the Jewish Federation
 Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the states leading tax
 attorneys will be out of the city until late next week and could not
 be reached for comment his office said
 
 Until 1990 Hochman a former US prosecutor also was a member of a
 panel appointed by thenSen Pete Wilson to secretly make initial
 recommendations on new federal judges in California  Hochman is a
 former regional president of the AntiDefamation League
 
 The league which initially cooperated with police has denied
 repeatedly that its intelligencegathering operation broke any laws
 League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an
 employee and have said they simply traded information with police
 departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes
 
 But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursdays searches
 San Francisco police alleged that ADL employees were apparently less
 than truthful in providing information during an earlier search
 conducted without a warrant
 
 David Lehrer executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office said
 the organization has not violated the law  There is nothing
 nefarious about how we operate or what we have done he said  Our
 record speaks for itself
 
 The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret
 fund used to pay for factfinding operations  Lehrer according to
 the documents signed checks from the account under the name L
 Patterson
 
 An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to
 a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending
 them directly to the AntiDefamation League
 
 Bullock 58 who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for
 nearly 40 years defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with
 San Francisco police  He said that he gathered names from many
 sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as
 Skins and Pinkos but that did not necessarily mean that they were
 under surveillance
 
 I might never see or call up on 99 of them again Bullock said
 And it doesnt mean anything that theyre in the files  Its not a
 threat to anyones civil rights that a name appears in my files under
 say Pinko
 
 In recent years Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police
 Officer Tom Gerard who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he
 was questioned by the FBI in the case
 
 A former CIA employee Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records
 and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses
 vehicle registration physical characteristics and drivers license
 photographs
 
 Using files gathered for the AntiDefamation League Gerard and
 Bullock also provided information to the South African government
 receiving 16000 over four years the documents show
 
 The file on Times staff writer Kraft which was apparently sold to the
 South African government provides some insight into the hitandmiss
 nature of the spy operation
 
 The file notes that Krafts articles appear frequently in The Times
 and are well researched and written but little else about the file
 is accurate  The brief entry confuses The Times Kraft with another
 Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong
 Krafts physical description photograph and other personal
 information
 
 Nevertheless the documents provide illuminating details of how
 Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations from
 skinheads to leftwing radicals searching regularly through the trash
 of target groups  Using AntiDefamation League funds he also ran his
 own paid informants under code names such as Scott and Scumbag
 
 He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast
 exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies
 including the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms
 
 It was Bullocks work as a paid informant for the FBI  while spying
 on behalf of the AntiDefamation League and the South African
 government  that proved his undoing The FBI learned that he was an
 agent of a foreign government and began investigating leading to the
 probe of the AntiDefamation Leagues intelligence network  The
 AntiDefamation League employed undercover operatives to gather
 information in Los Angeles San Francisco New York Washington
 Chicago St Louis and Atlanta according to the affidavit and
 investigators  Joining San Francisco police in searching league
 offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of
 San Francisco Dist Atty Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax
 Board  The Los Angeles Police Department which earlier refused to
 cooperate with the investigation was informed of the searches in Los
 Angeles but not invited to participate  Investigators suspect that
 some confidential information in the AntiDefamation League files may
 have come from Los Angeles police officers

 ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION
 
 By Richard C Paddock Times staff writer
 
 SAN FRANCISCO  The AntiDefamation League defended its record as a
 civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities
 who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential
 police information on citizens and groups
 
 But San Francisco Dist Atty Arlo Smith said that AntiDefamation
 League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many
 felony counts of receiving confidential files eavesdropping tax
 violations and conspiracy
 
 Police have accused the AntiDefamation League of not being truthful
 about its spying operations which collected information on more than
 12000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political
 spectrum
 
 Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show
 that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept
 files on political figures
 
 Even so Smith suggested that if the AntiDefamation League shut down
 its spy operation prosecutors would take that into account when
 deciding what charges to file
 
 In a statement released in Washington National Director Abraham H
 Foxman described the ADL as a Jewish defense agency which has fought
 to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80
 years
 
 Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on
 extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing
 information to police journalists academics government officials
 and the public  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain
 information illegally he said
 
 Like other journalists in order to protect the confidentiality and
 physical safety of its sources ADL will not comment on the nature or
 identity of any source of information Foxman said
 
 The AntiDefamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its
 longtime employees Roy Bullock was anything more than a private
 individual who is alleged to be an ADL informant
 
 Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements
 showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through
 Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I Hochman
 
 Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be
 distanced from ADL Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator
 Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment
 
 Despite the AntiDefamation Leagues assertion that it will cooperate
 with authorities San Francisco police said the group did not turn
 over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the groups
 offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall
 
 A second round of searches Thursday this time with search warrants
 produced a vast quantity of records primarily dealing with financial
 transactions Smith said  Further searches may be necessary and it
 will be at least a month before any charges are filed he said
 
 The investigation of course will go wherever the facts lead us
 the district attorney said
