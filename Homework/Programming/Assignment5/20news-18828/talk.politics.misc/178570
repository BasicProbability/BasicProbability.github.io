  Isnt it wonderfull the way people can make the sadistic and indescriminate
  murder of the BaderMeinhof gang sound like altruism
 
 Gee Phil Id remember where you are and that these people are monitoring the
    
 net  Id also remember that they have about as much sense of humor as Ed
    
 
 Damn It isnt Big Brother after all And all this time I thought that all
 those revolutionaries while blowing things up and killing the odd
 innocent person in the process really did love all us proles cause
 everybody knows that dialectical materialism will save you even
 if it has to get you killed first
 What a fool Ive been 

What you fail to see is that in order to make a nightmarish stew of psychosis
and repression you have to break a few eggs  You the evil productive 
elements in society are those eggs

Damn the spirit full speed ahead

 

Youre like a bunch of overeducated New York jewish ACLU lawyers
fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in
Arkansas  Holly Silva
