                       BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS

                          The Briefing Room



104 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Good afternoon  
	     
	     Q	  Could we do this on the lawn
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That would be nice  Lets go out 
to the cherry blossoms  Well do like the President
	     
	     Q	  Is the stimulus package dead 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely not  
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us more about the Dole talks  You 
said it was a good visit but no compromise
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes  The President had a good talk 
with Senator Dole last night  I think that as we said before there 
were no specific compromises on either side although it was a very 
good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as 
well  As you know the President first called Senator Dole I believe 
Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package  They did not 
speak  Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning  when the 
President was out  Instead he spoke with Tony Lake and at the close 
of that conversation indicated that he wanted to speak to the 
President about the jobs and stimulus package  They finally talked 
about that yesterday afternoon
	     
	     At the close of that discussion they said that they 
would have another talk last night which they did when the Senator 
was up in New Hampshire  And although there were no specific 
compromises made on either side they did say that they would 
continue to have some discussions  And thats where we are
	     
	     Q	  Well who is giving in  Where is it standing are 
both making concessions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know that its at that 
phase  No compromise has been made  As the President has said 
consistently he intends to come forward with an adjusted package  
He believes in the package but he believes that if its going to 
take adjustments to get the minority to release it hes willing to 
make those adjustments
	     
	     Q	  On the subject of a VAT 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh boy
	     
	     Q	  Can we stay on this for one more minute
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sure
	     
	     Q	  We have a problem with the five minutes 
	     
	     Q	  I know no decisions have been made but what would 
lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Sorry Andrea Im not going to go 
down that road  No decisions have been made  As the President said 
this morning a number of groups a number of members of Congress a 
number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked 
at  The working group is looking at it but no decisions have been 
made
	     
	     Q	  To follow have they done that directly through 
him  Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President 
about it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not to my knowledge although 
theres a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the 
VAT  But the President has not made a decision
	     
	     Q	  At the meetings that hes had with his own task 
force advisers have they discussed the funding issue and what the 
possible options would be
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think that that has been 
presented for a decision no
	     
	     Q	  Not for a decision but has it been discussed as an 
option
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again there are a lot of levels of 
briefing  I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the 
President as okay this is something for you to decide on  
	     
	     Q	  Youre not saying he didnt know it was being 
considered though are you
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No he said its being considered
	     
	     Q	  He knew that
	     
	     Q	  But has he discussed that with his advisers  
Thats what Im asking
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has said its being 
considered  I do not know what level of discussion there has been 
over the VAT  It is something the working groups are looking at  I 
dont even know that its 
	     
	     Q	  But he didnt say he was considering did he at 
this stage
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No he is not  I think were 
getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here  What is 
considered  
	     
	     Q	  Well he is the one who said I havent reviewed 
it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That is true  That is what I just 
repeated 
	     
	     Q	  George is there any concern here that as a result 
of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if 
it were to be considered hed let us know and having it trickle out 
the way it did that there may now be the development of a 
credibility gap on this issue and others
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think so  I mean it is 
now public knowledge that this is being considered
	     
	     Q	  Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute 
statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it 
was off the table and was not being considered and then to have it 
come out not from you people but 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well wait a second  It came out 
from the administration  What are you talking about
	     
	     Q	  What Im saying is though that the President said 
he would let us know 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Right
	     
	     Q	  You people then said  you said I believe that 
its not going to be on the program
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  On March 25th
	     
	     Q	  On March 25th 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Circumstances change
	     
	     Q	  Well I understand  But we have to find that out 
by rooting around in the fine print of an interview
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Rooting around  I know you did do 
a very good job there to read the USA Today article  But this is 
laughter  the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services  I mean that is common anytime you guys 
write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the 
Clinton administration the headline is  Ill look at it right 
here and AP story  Clinton wants more money for spying
	     
	     Q	  What about his remark that if it were being 
considered hed tell us about it  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  And the administrations concerned 
and hed let you know
	     
	     Q	  And did he
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes  Absolutely  What did he say 
this morning
	     
	     Q	  It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It didnt have to be dragged out of 
me  We had the Deputy Director of the OMB we had the Secretary of 
Health of Human Services say it was being considered  That is his 
administration  That is his administration policy
	     
	     Q	  Were these authorized trial balloons or were they 
orchestrated leaks  I mean what was the 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They were asked questions they 
answered the questions
	     
	     Q	  Youre saying here that it didnt have to be 
dragged out that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were 
considering it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Absolutely  I was very clear  
Painfully clear
	     
	     Q	  Was there a particular political strategy in making 
it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax 
day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No it was just this issue is being 
considered  They were asked if it was being considered they 
answered that it was being considered
	     
	     Q	  George The New York Times 
	     
	     Q	  Why do it yesterday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They were asked
	     
	     Q	  The New York Times reports today that Secretary 
Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and 
oranges numbers in order to portray last months unemployment figures 
in a way that was supportive of the Presidents job stimulus bill 
but which turned out to be totally false
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if it was totally 
false but I think  laughter  the chief economist at the Labor 
Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing and they 
say that 
	     
	     Q	  The question is is the President concerned about 
behavior that amounts to corrupting government data  And whats he 
doing about it if so
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The chief economist has said that a 
mistake was made it wont happen again and thats the end of the 
matter
	     
	     Q	  Isnt that the same information that goes to the 
President
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Theres two separate pieces of 
information  I think thats where the confusion was
	     
	     Q	  When did you all first learn about this mistake 
that was made
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I read the article this morning
	     
	     Q	  And as far as you know is the President aware of 
it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think so
	     
	     Q	  And was he aware of it before he read about it in 
The New York Times
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know  Not to my knowledge
	     
	     Q	  Did you ever hear about it before this morning  
Anything
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I didnt
	     
	     Q	  Wasnt the President given an erroneous spin on 
this for his own purpose  For his speeches for his arguments
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well again Im not sure  Both 
statements are true  What the Labor Department has granted is that 
mixing them in one sentence essentially was misleading  They said 
it was a mistake  They said they wouldnt do it again
	     
	     Q	  Did they drop it  is this something that you 
choose to spin or make an issue of
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Whenever fewer people are out of 
work were gratified  But that doesnt take away from the need to 
get this jobs package going
	     
	     Q	  If I could go back to the stimulus package for a 
minute  You said that the President plans to come forward with an 
amendment  Is the timetable still what it was  that the amendment 
would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday or did he in 
the conversation with Dole talk about the possibility of putting 
that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think at this point theres no 
changes in the schedule at all  I dont know that they discussed the 
timing like that
	     
	     Q	  Do you believe that youre closer or getting closer 
this week than you were last week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I believe that were going 
to pass a jobs package  The President is prepared to make 
adjustments in order to get that to happen  I dont know where the 
votes are on cloture at this particular time  I dont know whats 
going to happen until we have a vote  But the President believes 
deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done
	     
	     Q	  Has there been any indication that this situation 
has changed
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were going to continue to work on 
it  Well know when the votes are taken
	     
	     Q	  George last week you said that there are  or 
various people in the administration were saying that you couldnt go 
through Dole you were going to have to try and go around him because 
he was immovable on this subject of a compromise or at least the 
compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could 
accept  This week youre talking to him  Is that because youve 
realized that the peeling off effort wasnt going to work
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats because Senator Dole wanted 
to talk to the President about the stimulus package
	     
	     Q	  He initiated the conversation
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Reich this morning said that in fact 
the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all  You 
say hes making 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know that thats exactly 
what he said  I think he said he didnt have any indication that 
there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise 
and the President doesnt want to compromise  And the President 
doesnt want to compromise  But if he has to make adjustments to get 
it through he will
	     
	     Q	  Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was 
working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before 
the actual vote
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its possible
	     
	     Q	  Today
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not sure exactly when that will 
happen but I think that its very possible that well come forward 
with some sort of a different package or Senate Democrats will come 
forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it 
passed
	     
	     Q	  As we understood his conversations with Dole the 
first one was some discussion of this and Ill get back to you 
tonight with some details or some adjustments or whatever the phrase 
is  Did he offer him some details or some adjustments  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think its a question of how 
detailed  I mean I think they had a general discussion about the 
package last night subsequent to their conversation yesterday 
afternoon  I believe that there will be followup discussions today 
in the Senate not necessarily between the President and Senator 
Dole  And let me just reiterate neither side has made specific 
compromises at this date  When we have something well let you know  
And Im not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that 
weve talked about or that weve offered anything in a hard way
	     
	     Q	  What are the followup discussions if not the 
President and Dole
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think Senator Mitchell is going 
to talk to Senator Dole
	     
	     Q	  Is that a threat  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Did the President say to Senator Dole all right 
how about this number as an overall size or did Dole say to the 
President I can go as high as this  Did they talk numbers
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think it was a negotiation 
in that respect  It was more of a discussion about their positions
	     
	     Q	  Did they discuss actual numbers
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im just not sure  I know they 
talked about the basic outlines of the packages  I think they talked 
about the programs they cared about  I dont know if they got to the 
level of this many xbillion dollars 
	     
	     Q	  Does Dole have to sign off before there is a 
package
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No of course not
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House have anything to do with the 
protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole 
was speaking  Was that in any way organized by 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not to my knowledge no
	     
	     Q	  And has the President been in touch with Senators 
Kohl or Feingold  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think hes talked to them 
no
	     
	     Q	  George is the President considering the more 
palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the 
haves having to continuously pay for the havenots  And is he going 
to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few with the haves 
having to pay for the havenots
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes deeply that 
the tax rates on upper income Americans as he presented in his 
budget should go up  And I think for the second half of your 
question Ill refer you to my briefing from yesterday
	     
	     Q	  George on the subject of accuracy in information 
you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money 
that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee  Apparently that is 
not true  Its actually waste water money
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its waste water money for 
Wisconsin and some could go to Milwaukee 
	     
	     Q	  But it would not affect the drinking water problem 
because its waste water money right
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  It would affect the water treatment 
overall 
	     
	     Q	  But the implication from your statement the other 
day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now  
Would you agree thats not the case
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not sure of the specifics  I 
know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin
	     
	     Q	  A leftover question from this morning which was 
when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating 
on a VAT
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not sure exactly when  I just 
dont know  I assume it came up over the last  certainly between 
the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago  
	     
	     Q	  So sometime since March 25th
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think thats right  I dont know 
the exact date
	     
	     Q	  George the President this morning mentioned that 
some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax  Apparently the 
National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax 
being okay if it replaces the BTU tax  So does the President feel 
that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax hes proposed 
or is this totally in addition to the other taxes hes already 
proposed  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think weve said all we have to 
say about the VAT at this point  I mean theres just no  this is 
being considered by the health care working groups and that is all  
The President hasnt made any further decisions beyond that 
	     
	     Q	  But it would be to finance health care it wouldnt 
be to replace some other tax that finances  it wouldnt replace the 
income tax for instance
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  There have been no discussions on 
that
	     
	     Q	  In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress 
Senator Doles press release today said VAT  on tax day  Do you 
think  does it have a chance of getting through Congress  Would it 
have a chance
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I have no idea 
	     
	     Q	  Is that a consideration whether you all put it 
forward
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  That would become a consideration 
if the President were to decide to do it  Its not in consideration 
now
	     
	     Q	  You said at the beginning of the briefing that 
circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under 
consideration
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes what the President referred to 
this morning  These groups came forward and said this is something 
that has to be considered
	     
	     Q	  Those are the circumstances that have changed  
Thats the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled 
it out that groups have asked it to be considered
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats what he said 
	     
	     Q	  Is that true
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Was there in fact some understanding that sin 
taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im not going to get into the 
deliberations
	     
	     Q	  But George 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  What the consideration is as 
the President said groups came forward and said this is something 
you ought to consider  The working groups are looking at it 
	     
	     Q	  Is that the only thing thats changed since his 
prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Can you explain how those groups  how that 
information got to him that groups wanted it  Was it just reading 
the newspaper or did groups make presentations
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think the groups  as you know 
the health care task force has met with dozens of groups
	     
	     Q	  But this is the Presidents knowledge that these 
groups had come forward
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think he was referring to what 
was coming to the working groups  Obviously there have also been 
published positions in the newspapers
	     
	     Q	  Have certain groups briefed him on the groups 
presentations to them
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if theyve briefed him 
 I mean how detailed the briefings have been    I know that the 
working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these 
groups
	     
	     Q	  What kind of arguments did the groups make that 
were persuasive enough that the President would change the position 
that he had enunciated previously
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know its just theyve had 
longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance 
health care
	     
	     Q	  The President wasnt aware of those longstanding 
positions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He may have been at some level  
Obviously hes been a governor for a long time and he knows the 
basic arguments for and against a VAT tax
	     
	     Q	  What were trying to figure out here  youre 
telling us that the only change the only thing that affected this 
change in the Presidents attitude toward the VAT between February 
and now 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The Presidents attitude hasnt 
necessarily changed  I mean he has not made a decision
	     
	     Q	  I know but the President said that it was off the 
table  So did you  And youre saying that the only thing thats 
changed is the positions of these groups except youre also 
describing them as longstanding positions  I dont see the change  
If these groups havent had any change in their position thats been 
made to the President 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well theyve made the 
presentations to the health care task force
	     
	     Q	  Theres no relationship at all between the fact 
that sin taxes that he had said  suggested in February that he 
favored will not produce enough revenue to finance 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think he ever suggested 
that they would produce all the revenue
	     
	     Q	  Well he suggested that he thought that those were 
appropriate ways to finance health care
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  He did say that  I dont know that 
he said anything to refute that
	     
	     Q	  But in fact has the task force discovered that 
there wouldnt be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind 
of core benefits 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I dont think that the task 
force ever suggested that there would
	     
	     Q	  George if he advocated a VAT tax would that break 
his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his 
programs
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I cant comment on a hypothetical 
situation
	     	  
	     Q	  But does that promise  would that promise not to 
raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him 
from seeking a VAT tax
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President has made no decisions 
on the VAT tax  When he does well tell you and well explain the 
implications then
	     
	     Q	  Which specific groups can you cite  business 
labor or otherwise  whose recommendations to the health care task 
force has prompted this consideration
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont have the specific  I just 
dont have that
	     
	     Q	  George can you tell us to what extend these other 
alternatives for instance the employer tax or the sin taxes or 
other financing options are also still on the table and what these 
options are
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No as members of the task force 
and representatives of the working groups have said they are looking 
at a wide variety of options  I think that Ira Magaziner said that 
there are 20 different options under consideration  But Im not 
going to comment 
	     
	     Q	  Whats the scope 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im just not going to comment on 
them no
	     
	     Q	  Whats the scope of the need  How much are you 
talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Thats what the health care task 
force is looking at
	     
	     Q	  Since theres not going to be any briefing on the 
Miyazawa visit two questions  One generally what does the 
President hope to use that meeting for but more specifically is his 
task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and 
the remark about market access at the press conference
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The Vancouver note
	     
	     Q	  Does no mean yes
	     
	     Q	  Yes and no
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I dont know  I saw the 
Prime Ministers press conference where he was asked the question 
about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when 
he was asked the question  The questions of trade are something that 
certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the 
President  There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and 
the US that we want to do something about
	     
	     Q	  Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he 
suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in 
terms of trade  Are you going to oblige  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS   I think the President will state 
our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit 
very clearly  I dont necessarily want to agree with your 
characterization of the Prime Ministers comments
	     
	     Q	     that we need specific export targets specific 
numerical targets  is that what hes going to discuss with 
Miyazawa
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Theyre going to have a broad 
discussion of a wide range of trade issues  I dont want to get into 
those specifics until after the meeting
	     
	     Q	  Why
	     
	     Q	   Thats the crux of the issue right  Whether or 
not  does the President believe that without specific numerical 
targets it is really as he said in his press conference sort of 
hopeless that this is going to change very much
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes that we must 
have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around  I do not 
want to get into the specifics of how that would be done
	     
	     Q	  But does the President believe that their stimulus 
package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think first the President wants 
to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister 
Miyazawa himself and then hell make the comment on it
	     
	     Q	  How about the Russian aid package  There seems to 
be some confusion about how the US views that Secretary 
Christopher saying  or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do 
more the Japanese saying that thats not what they heard
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again were going to continue to 
work with all our allies in the G7 and were going to continue to 
press for help for Russian reform Russian democratic reform  And I 
think that so far we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and 
were going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral 
packages
	     
	     Q	  Do you think the Japanese need to do more
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were going to continue to work 
with all our allies to do as much as we can
	     
	     Q	  Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today 
Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatchers comments on 
the Bosnia policy  And he said Its a rather emotional response  
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Over an emotional issue
	     
	     Q	  Right  to an emotional problem  Does the White  
House condone that kind of remark
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think that Secretary 
Christophers remarks speaks for itself  The President believes also 
that this is a deeply troubling situation that were trying to find 
answers for 
	     
	     Q	  But that specific  rather emotional response  
specific term
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No it speaks for itself
	     
	     Q	  In connection with that doesnt it seem that with 
the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment is it 
good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now 
to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  For example
	     
	     Q	  To take stronger action to take military action  
air strikes anything that can be done
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  The President believes that what 
must be done now is to push harder for sanctions  He is also  as 
you know the administration has been discussing lifting the arms 
embargo  He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase 
pressure at this time
	     
	     Q	  What is your response to the critics who would say 
that the US is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain 
the presidency
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Theyre wrong  Were pressing hard 
for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table  Were pressing hard 
for increased sanctions and were talking to our allies about the 
arms embargo
	     
	     Q	  You were putting great store in Vance and Owen 
getting people to agree to that  Now Vance and Owen have both said 
that military force to some extent would be acceptable  Does that 
change your thinking
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Clearly were going to listen to 
whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to 
say  But at this point the President is moving forward on sanctions 
and talking about the arms embargo
	     
	     Q	  A followup on a Dee Dee comment this morning  She 
said she would be able to provide some administration officials who 
could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia  Are 
you going to be able to do that or do you have anything 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think thats what she said
	     
	     Q	  Thats exactly what she said
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think thats true  But 
what she said  we would look into the situation of what kind of 
evidence can be provided in Bosnia  Obviously if there are 
connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and 
we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade that will have 
an effect over time  I do not know day by day minute by minute 
what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact 
effect has been   But clearly we are slowing the shipment of goods 
into Belgrade  We are having an effect on the Serbs there  What 
kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I dont 
know  But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at 
all I dont know why theyd be fighting it so much
	     
	     Q	  Are the First Ladys tax returns going to be 
released
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think theres a joint tax return  
And it will be probably later today
	     
	     Q	  Is the President considering signing an executive 
order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work 
force as part of the gay rights march here next week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think theres any proposal 
for that at this time not that I know of
	     
	     Q	  Its something that the President promised during 
the campaign that he would do
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I have not seen any  I dont 
think its anything thats on his plate right now
	     
	     Q	  Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point 
on this issue
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know about on this issue  
I assume that hell meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian 
community sometime soon as he meets with representatives of lots of 
different groups and communities
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if thats scheduled 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its probably going to be tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Probably going to be tomorrow  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Its a good thing you asked
	     
	     Q	  Whos probably going to be there  Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know
	     
	     Q	  How long 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know  Thats all I know
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if its at 300 pm tomorrow  
Laughter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know what time it is  I 
dont even know for sure if its going to be tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  Environmental groups have asked him to make a major 
speech next week of some kind  Is that going to happen do you know
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if theyve asked but 
I think the President has always planned as he did last year to 
give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will  If its not 
exactly on Earth Day it might be a day before or something like 
that
	     
	     Q	  Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of 
the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I dont know the specific 
timing of something like that but its certainly something under 
discussion and something weve been working on
	     
	     Q	  Campaign finance reform
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Were working on it
	     
	     Q	  Do you think it will be next week
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im just not sure
	     
	     Q	  The biodiversity treaty is something youre working 
on  I missed the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes something were working on  
He asked if it was ready to be signed and I said I didnt know 
anything about that but its something weve certainly been working 
on
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what organizations might be represented 
in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont
	     
	     Q	  Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out 
of town on the day of the march
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Hes got to be at the Senate 
meeting in Jamestown and I believe hes also going to be giving a 
speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston 
on Sunday as he did last year
	     
	     Q	  Would you have told us if she had not pressed you 
on the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  On what
	     
	     Q	  On the gays
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  When we went through the 
Presidents schedule for the day certainly
	     
	     Q	    George what day is the publishers speech  Is 
that Sunday
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think its a Sunday
	     
	     Q	  And Saturday hell be in Jamestown
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  So youre just going to be in Jamestown for one 
day
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No Im not sure  I dont know how 
long the Senate thing goes  It might go overnight  I just dont 
know
	     
	     Q	  You would have made the gay meeting public right
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im certain if we had the meeting 
 I dont know about open to the press but we would have told you 
about it
	     
	     Q	  I mean because it is as far as I can tell the 
first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with   

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I didnt say it was going to be in 
the Oval Office  Laughter  But I didnt  Im not say that its 
not but I didnt say that it was  Laughter
	     
	     Q	     at the White House in the Bush administration 
gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White 
House had to repudiate having done that  So I just wanted to make 
sure 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well the President wouldnt do 
anything like that
	     
	     Q	  Certainly not
	     
	     Q	  What marching orders did the President give to 
General Vessey
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  They had a very good discussion for 
about half an hour today  He wanted  the most important thing was 
he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs  He will 
obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document  
The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting 
and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes 
in our policy towards Vietnam  Hell be looking at Vietnams 
response to the questions raised by the document and hell also look 
into investigations on discrepancy cases increased efforts on 
remains implementing trilateral investigations  and access to 
military archives  
	     
	     And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the 
activities of the joint commission and on the document
	     
	     Q	  Vietnam says its a fake  What is the DOD analysis 
at this stage
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Its not completed yet and its 
also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the 
Vietnamese
	     
	     Q	  A number of Defense officials have been saying that 
they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are in fact 
nonAmericans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to 
as Americans from time to time  Do people  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  We dont have any final 
determination  Were going to wait for the complete review when we 
have it well make a judgment
	     
	     Q	  I know you dont have any final determination but 
given all of the intense public interest in this do you think that 
thats a likely possibility
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I just dont want to characterize 
it in any way until the review is complete
	     
	     Q	  George was there a topic scheduled for the speech 
in Boston
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No 
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to have a press conference 
tomorrow with Miyazawa
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I think so but Im not positive  
Yes I expect yes
	     
	     Q	  Was Toon in with Vessey  
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes 
	     
	     Q	  He was in on the meeting
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  What was the question
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey 
and the answer is yes 
	     
	     Q	  Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal 
report this morning the Presidents distressed about some of his 
press clippings and that perhaps hes distressed with you about that
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  No  Well I do have a response  I 
think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied 
that the President has had restricted access to the press  I would 
point out that hes answered 358 questions on 77 occasions more than 
any of his predecessors I would also point out it also 
	     
	     Q	  How many questions
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Three hundred fiftyeight on 77 
occasions
	     
	     Q	  How many were while he was jogging
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well no thats actually a very 
good question Andrea  And I would point out further that the 
article also implied that these questions were only answered at 
tightly controlled photo opportunities which is just patently false  
Hes had 13 press conferences in either the East Room the Oval 
Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room in addition to 
questions taken at photo opportunities and that is only the 
	     
	     Q	  Oval Office press conference  when was that 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Hes answered questions in the 
East Room  Hes had five in the East Room hes had one in the Oval 
Office hes had one in the Rose Garden hes had one or two in the 
Roosevelt Room  And this is just to the White House Washington 
Press Corps  In addition to that hes had 17 interviews with local 
television anchors  Hes met with the editorial board of The 
Portland Oregonian  Hes had an hourlong interview with Dan Rather 
Hes had interviews with local press from California Florida and 
Connecticut 
	     
	     Q	  Can you address the question of the attitude  The 
article implies that he doesnt 
	     
	     Q	  Why doesnt he like us  Laughter
	     
	     Q	  Did you really get blamed for that Post story
	     
	     Q	  The story is that you  are you held responsible 
for it
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think Im going to comment 
about this
	     
	     Q	  Are you denying that the President has shown 
displeasure publicly
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I am not commenting on the 
discussions between the President and myself
	     
	     Q	  Did the President write that letter to Chris 
Webber
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  What
	     
	     Q	  The letter to the University of Michigan basketball 
player
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Oh yes
	     
	     Q	  That is an authentic letter
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Since the President first talked about the VAT in 
February he said at the time that he thought there probably should 
be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing  
Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I just cant comment on a 
proposal he hasnt made
	     
	     Q	  George does the President have some agenda for 
this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Well I think it will just a 
general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about 
including AIDS and other issues  civil rights
	     
	     Q	  The military issue
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Im certain it will come up
	     
	     Q	  Is he using this event to name the AIDS 
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont think so
	     
	     Q	  George what specifically is the President doing to 
prepare for tomorrows meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Hes had briefing memos  Hes had 
general discussions with members of the Treasury Department the 
Trade Representative and others
	     
	     Q	     report yet
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  I dont know if he has the report 
referred to in The Times but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him 
today
	     
	     Q	  He was
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Yes
	     
	     Q	  Does he intend to use any of these instances that 

	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Again I dont know that the 
reports been presented  But obviously the President will press 
hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred
	     
	     Q	  In terms of the Wall Street Journal the thrust was 
that theres a real schism here  a hostility  Do you think he 
feels that way
	     
	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  Not at all  As I said on the 
record in the article I think the President likes reporters  Again 
I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading  The 
thrust of the article was that in some way some attitude which the 
President may or may not have is affecting access when in fact he 
has the most open accessible administration than have any in recent 
history

	     Q	  Can we come up to your office  Laughter

	     MR STEPHANOPOULOS  If youre invited  
	     
	     THE PRESS  Thank you

                                 END                    134 PM EDT
