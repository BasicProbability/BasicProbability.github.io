Subject Drug Use Up Among US Eighthgraders


The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday April 14 1993
issue of USA Today Drug Use Up Among US eighthgraders by Mike
Snider p 6D

    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get more teens are
    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky 

    For the last two years government officials have trumpeted results
    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is
    being won  But this year officials are retreating  drug use by
    eighthgraders has risen according to the survey of 50000 students
    nationwide

    Possible reason for the increase  more experimentation  Why  If
    drug use dropped during the 80s eventually some students will
    have fewer drugusing contemporaries who act as examples of
    substance abuses drawbacks says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston
    one of the survey authors  Each new wave of youths must be given
    the knowledge skills and motivation to resist using these drugs
    Johnston says

    This type of resurgence is possible says Eileen Shiff author of
    Experts Advise Parents Delta 1495  But thats not the issue
    she says  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today
    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now

    Aggravating the problem  baby boomer parents  who experimented with
    drugs and alcohol as teens  trying to be friends not parents to
    their children  Ive even seen parents serving kegs of beer to
    their underage kids and friends Shiff says  For a recent graduation
    Shiff and other parents organized an allnight lockin party where
    no booze or drugs were allowed  We need to fulfill that parental
    role otherwise the peer group takes over she says

    Officials may talk about the war on drugs but they really havent
    done anything that Ive seen says Suzanne Linkous Scottsdale
    Ariz 16 a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs dating and
    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line  Linkous a
    member of USA Todays Teen Panel says theres always going to be
    experimentation with drugs

    A real war on drugs could be waged educationwise she says  But
    some dont want to give kids the facts  They think it will give
    them ideas its the same with birth control  I think you should
    give the kids the information or have it accessible through classes
    pamphlets and speakers she says

    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school  in
    kindergarten says Dallas Owens 17 teen panelist from Miami Shores
    Fla  I remember in kindergarten I used to see drugs  I think
    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds
    about using drugs he says

    Scare tactics in public service announcements arent working only
    one commercial has gotten it right he says  The commercial opens
    with two goodlooking girls in the restroom talking about having
    no prom date  Then they take a hit off a joint  That hits home
    because its not attractive he says  You cant be doing drugs if
    you want somebody to like you
