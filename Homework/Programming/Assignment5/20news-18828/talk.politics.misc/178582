 The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
 draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we dont have one now
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
 on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
 Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
 Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 Lets axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

Let me say this about that as a retired Navy officer 

I agree Cut it  But lets not stop there 

Eliminate the C17 transport Overwight overdue overbudget it was
supposed to carry tanks New tanks are now too big for the airplane 

Scrap the Seawolf SSN21 nuclear submarine The breakup of the USSR has
left us with a number of sticky military problems but NONE of them will
require Gods gift to submarines 

Ground the B2 stealth bomber Im sure its a great airplane that will do
EVERYTHING its designers said but at halfagigabuck a copy we cant
afford for even ONE to crash And airplanes DO crash 

Elmo Zumwalt said it best 20 years ago HighLow A MIX of a FEW
extremely capable weapons systems and a LOT of CHEAPER
moderatecapability systems
