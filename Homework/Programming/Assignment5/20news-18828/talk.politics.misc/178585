Excuse me for sticking my nose in but any parentparents who do not allready 
immunize their children especially if it is already free dont deserve one 
frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves or public health 
care service

I know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are 
slightly seperate issues but anybody who wouldnt help their kids dont 
deserve my tax help

Hmmmmmwhat about their kids
