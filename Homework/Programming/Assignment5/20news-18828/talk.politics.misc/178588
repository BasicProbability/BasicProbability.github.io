Heres my own top ten response to Mr Ipsers list

8   It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work
     to provide the services that people need and to help solve the problems
     that need to be solved  Granted some things can probably be done more
     efficiently for less money and should be  But some things are going to
     cost more money and Im sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about
     taxes all the time  You want to live in my country you pay your fair
     share

Some people pay shares that are more fair than others and will continue
to do so even with the presence of President Clinton  Until the rich 
elite hurt from taxes and shower me with their blood dripping from the
wound of the tax dagger I will scream and yell  Because taxes are 
killing the poor and middleclass and Im tired of the wealthy getting
a free ride in this country  Sure they pay a lot of taxes but I want
them to SHARE MY PAIN

And not even Slick Willy is that fair is he seeing that he and his
wife qualify as one of those wealthy people I was talking about  Theyre
on the lower end of wealthy but wealthy they are

7   I cant believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give
     up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes  If youre
     willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an
     enemy which at best doesnt affect us and at worst really should be our
     friend then you have no right to tell me you shouldnt pay taxes

Yah I think the draft for Vietnam was a sack of shit  But do we get
to pick and choose which laws we obey Mr Chaudhary  If so shall we
set up a you follow the laws you like and Ill follow the laws I 
like arrangement

6   Hey I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60sesque touch

I never thought much of beaded curtains
 
Now beaded seatcovers on the other hand

5   Health care is a human rightdeleted

I didnt think I was going to respond to this but I changed my mind

Tell me why do you think health care is a human right  

This isnt a flame or anything I just wonder  Next thing you know 
free public transportation will be a human right  Maybe membership
at prestigious health spas

Sorry to grease the hill on ya there

4   Make love not War

Be sure and wrap that wanker when you go spreadin that free love stuff
around  Or after the FDA gets its thumb out of its ass use that neat
new Reality femicondom

3   Contrary to popular belief it is possible to be a male and a feminist
     at the same time  To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity
     to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong and trying to force
     them into some sort of tradition role is even worse  Women certainly 
     have as much to offer this world as men and the day that gender
     discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of
     the past few centuries seem like reform bills  I look forward to it

So do I  Amen  And all that

1   HEY MAN ACADAMIA RULES

What the hell is an acadamia anyway  Is that like a macadamia  

cpk
 
Its been 80 days  Do you know where your wallet is

Slick Willys already got his hand in my pocket  Im just afraid
of what he might grab hold of
