This country is hardly ruined In fact it is booming compared to after the
1980 election

This whole USA has gone to hell and ReaganBush caused it is not only lame
pathetic and old its wrong

Under ReaganBush the economy grew by 11 trillion dollars  This is more than 
the entire economy of Germany a kind gentle country in many peoples 
books  What a joke

Drive down to Cincinnati and take a look  Not pretty is it
Things were much better there in 1980  All that growth went into
the hands of Ron and Georgies pals and I DIDNT GET A SINGLE
DIME OF IT DAMMIT  And now Im gonna be bled to death by tax
leeches to pay for the damage  Fing great

Oh heres another thing  Seems like a lot of people in 
Columbus drive over to Marysville and make Japanese cars  Hm
I wonder how many Americanowned companies employ those in
Central Ohio  Other than Ohio State University

Its been 80 days  Do you know where your wallet is

Slick Willys already got his hand in my pocket  Im just afraid
of what he might grab hold of
