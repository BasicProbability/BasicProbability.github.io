 First off they could recognise Iraqus responsibility in initiating the
 IranIraq war Providing technical assistance to Iran to get its oil
 production back up to capacity would also be a smart move at the moment 
 Iran is above its OPEC ceiling If they had extra capacity they would
 use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests

I agree with most of what Phill says except the point about it being in
our interests to bring down the oil price  Consider that both the US
and Great Britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy 
their energy needs    Pricy OPEC oil impacts both Germany
Japan and many other industrial rivals more than these two  
In addition the proceeds from the sale especially by Saudi Arabia Kuwait
UAE etc are disproportionately reinvested in the US and GB 
propping up these economies and further providing an incentive 
to keep prices from falling too low
