  BTW is anyone besides myself peeved that nonUS citizens Puerto
  Ricans etc are very close to having full representation in the US
  House of Representatives
 
 
    Sorry Chris Puerto Ricans are US citizens

OK  I stand corrected  I guess then that the comments about payoffs
ie pork to Puerto Ricans that others have been making still
stands

Now everybody how about some opinion on the following related topic

Should the people who are natives of US territories have
representation in the US House of Reps or the US Congress
The US Constitution sets up the House of Representatives to represent
each State in proportion to its population and the Senate to represent
each State equally  What should be done with US territories like
Puerto Rico  Does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
the past such as with the Louisiana Territory or the Northwest
Territory
