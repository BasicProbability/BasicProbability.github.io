 Any thoughts on who is going to count all of the gorgeous bodies at 
 the MOW  The press  The White House Staff  The most Junior 
 Senator  The King of the motssbi  

 Just curious as to whose bias we are going to see when the numbers 
 get brought out

Probably law enforcement people Park Service Police and DC cops
who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
density of the crowd in small regions

These sort of techniques derive from Army Intelligence and CIA
methods of estimating troop strength and tend to be
methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers
so as to justify bigger budgets

Judging from past experience the 87 March a Peace and Justice March the 
same year and 3 different Procoice Marches The Park Service will come out
with an estimate that is approximately 12 the estimate that organizers will
come up with  though the last Choice march I went to had a signin system 
and the numbers ended up closer  And then youve got the media types in their
helicopters rolling dice

I believe the MOW plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy and 
basing their count on those  I see two problems with this  One can they 
get everybody to take one and only one  Two they couldnt possibly have
been able to choose a colordesign that wont clash with somebodys outfit
