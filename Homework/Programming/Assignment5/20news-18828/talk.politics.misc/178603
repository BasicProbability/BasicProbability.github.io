Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage

In article 15427optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes

  1 So what
 
 Homosexuals lie about the 10 number to hide the disproportionate
 involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  They also lie
 about 10 to keep politicians scared
 

Back your statments with proof or shut up

  2 It will be interesting to see the reaction when 25million queers
     gather in Washington DC After all if there are only 6million of
     us then this is an event unprecidented in history
 
 But many of the people who will be marching arent homosexuals but
 other members of the leftist agenda
 

Again back your statements or shut up

  The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
  The median number of sexual partners for all men 2039 was 73
  
  Dont forget that 25 had 20 or more partners
 
 Not surprising  Remember that study includes homosexuals as well
 

Hmm  Tell me did you go to the Mickey Mouse school of logic  You have
just stated that there are not many homosexuals as Kinsey reported in his
survey and the surveys of the Kinsey Institute since  Then you say that
the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
a large part of that group or there are some homosexuals whose lives 
consist of having sex with no gaps for eating c  Using your logic
it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about 2000 partners each
a week  Try to think through your arguments carefully  Or then again not
because I like to laugh every now and then

  Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
  and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
  homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
  male population  
  
  And what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
  who said they where homosexual Or is that number to inconvient for
  you
 
 It wasnt published
 

Hence the argument cannot be resolved using this data  Next point please

  Its a shame that we dont have a breakdown for
  straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
  how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
  
  Fuck off
 
 Typical homoseuxal response
 
 

This depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour gay bi
and hetero  This has yet to be proved  See an earlier post about the Kinsey
Institute of grading  This although rough seems more logical  Also you use
this would show defining a fact and not an assumption  Again back your 
statements or shut up
