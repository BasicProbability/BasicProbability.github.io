Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage

In article 15437optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes



 You might  except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than
 straight men  which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are
 

Excuse me a moment when I laugh my head off  I defy you to prove
your statement damaged and screwed up  You cant  Oh dear  Your
argument once again Mr LogicNOT falls flat on its face

Take a course in civil behaviour and logic  Then come back and defend
your arguments
