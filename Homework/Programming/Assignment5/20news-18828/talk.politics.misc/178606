   I note with insufficient emotion that amongst the five survivors of the 
   Waco debacle there were two Brits and an Aussie The AngloSaxon persona 
   really doesnt lend itself to martyrdom for a spurious messiah

I dont see how you draw that conclusion  Around 20 of the 80 inside the
buildings were British one quarter  Two out of the eight latest count I
heard survivors were British one quarter  Anyhow British doesnt equate
to  AngloSaxon

What exactly are you trying to say  And why were there no fireengines within
a mile of the compound
 
Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters


  What crap Phil 50mm Wrong To give you a clue as to how big 50mm is the
 F16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other 
 aircraft A 50mm gun would be somewhere in the cannon realm They might
 have had 50 calibre but definitely not 50mm
