 When you force people to associate with others against their will
 yes
 
 


Good grief  I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may
be discussed intelligently

I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic
minority  However your argument again falls flat on its face  You state
that you under an antidiscrimination bill would be forced to associate
with others homosexuals I assume against your will  How do you know that
you do not associate with them now except they may be closeted   Would you
like to change your argument to read forced to associate with truthfully
homosexual people against my will  You have no proof that anyone you
now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your
argument  Is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour sic
and that is the camp mincing type  Prove it  You cannot

I must admit though that it looks as if you actually thought about your response
this time instead of just raving
