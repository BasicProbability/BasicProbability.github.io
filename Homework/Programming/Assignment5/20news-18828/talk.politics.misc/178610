 The Walz monster above however was past 40 when he molested these
 kids as he says above


Hehehe  Dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements

Clayton babe please define the word molest  Are you using a legal
term or a proper dictionary term  Molest as far as I can remember means
to do damage to persons  My mate Mike was lured into a womans parlour
when he was 14  Is that molestation  A number of my friends straight lost
their virginity before that  Were they molested  They told me that they
thoroughly enjoyed the experience  I see no damage  

Please stop pushing your objective morality on others  If you push people wont
fall over and say Ye gads youre right theyll just push back

Have you signed up for that logic course yet
