	If you look through this newsgroup you should be 
	able to find Clintons proposed Wiretapping Initiative
                     
	for our computer networks and telephone systems

	This initiative has been up before Congress for at least
	the past 6 months in the guise of the FBI Wiretapping
        
	bill

What kind of brainless clod posted the above garbage Would they be
so kind as to explain how this is Clintons initiative when it
has been before Congress for at least the past 6 months

    It is Clintons initiative now  He is pushing it hard
    Arent the liberals supposed to be concerned about privacy
    rights

    If you want to know more about the wiretapping initiative
    read 1984  its in there installed in every bedroom
