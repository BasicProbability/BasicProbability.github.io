 The median of a distribution is that variatevalue which divides the
 distribution halfway ie 12 of the distribution population have
 lower and half have higher variatevalues

 So for Males 2039 the median73 this means that half of these men
 are higher than this and half are lower than this  Now if the population
 sample size is 3300 and 1 of them are gay 33 males are gay  If we
 say they are distributed equally then only 165 are greater than 73
 sexual partners of course this means that 495 heterosexual men are
 greater than 73

Not quite  First the median does not imply that half of the men are
above and half below 73 it simply means that 73 is the midpoint
between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most
likely zero  However assuming your implication to be moreorless
correct your final result is still invalid  If 50 of all males
have had more than 73 partners and you deduct the assumed 1 of 
homosexual males what remains is not 495 but still 50 of all
heterosexual males  Which is to say hey were all human
