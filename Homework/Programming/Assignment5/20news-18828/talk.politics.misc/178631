 My point if it alluded you is that as LONG
 as the USA remains in the State of REBELLION
 against Gods Divinely APPOINTED Vicar over
 these colonies what more can YOU expect from
 PaganIdolators Alienated From Gods Wonderful Plan
 
 
   obGeoPoliticalContext I was Pleased that the 
   restoration of the Bourbon de Bourbons to
What tree did you just climb down from the church is an opressive farce which
destroys cultures Im not knocking religious morality but I think that
Americans take their religion TOO SERIOUSLY to the point of trying to convert
anyone or anything to their particular sect Its a  question of power and not
salvation All monotheistic religions breed intoleraance into their flock
Islam Judaism AND CHRISTIANITY Religion is not the opiate of the masses
fanaticism is and brother it lookes like youre pretty hopped up on your own
selfrightousness


never heard of arguement by absurdity eh no  Also called
sarcasm  The usual procedure is to accept some part of the
oppositions arguement and run with it until one goes
beyond rational thought and then ring the changes

zB The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one
And in these times of economic difficulty the Washington
legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from
425 the federal level to 490 fifteen cents over
Oregons
	It would seem to me that this increase does not
keep pace with inflation that the minimum wage should be
to 608 by my figures so it is proposed that we raise
the minimum wage to 650 per hour by 1 July and then give
a 10 cost of living increase every 4 July

and anyone who doesnt like it is obviously a country club
republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people
