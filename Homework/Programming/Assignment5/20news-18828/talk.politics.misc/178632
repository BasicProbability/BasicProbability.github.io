Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage

In article 15427optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes
 Dont forget that 25 had 20 or more partners

Not surprising  Remember that study includes homosexuals as well

Err earth to Clayton you posted this to show that 2 were
homosexual So if we assume EVERY homosexual was promiscious that
leads us to conclude that 23 percent of heterosexuals are promiscious
And that first assumtion is a bad one

Clayton it IS suprising from the claims you are making
