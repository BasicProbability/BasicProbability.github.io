Subject Re Why not concentrate on child molesters

In article 15453optilinkCOM walshoptilinkCOM Mark Walsh writes
Really  I thought that insurance companies hired all of
their actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated
with all groups of people and that gays are more likely
to have AIDS than are those of other sexual orientations

Correlation  causality

The risk factor is having nonmonogomous unprotected sex not being
homosexual
