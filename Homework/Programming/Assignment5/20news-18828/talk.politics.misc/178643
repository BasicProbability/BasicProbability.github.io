Subject Re Are Americans sexually repressed

crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes

Unless of course the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder caused by childhood sexual abuse as a number of
recent works suggest

Which number is that  Zero

Please present a number of authoritative works which suggest
that homosexuality is a form of mental disorder caused by
childhood sexual abuse

Dont present your own biased conclusions based on a collage
of tidbits youve extracted from a few hours research as the
conclusions of people who study mental disease and sexual abuse
professionally
