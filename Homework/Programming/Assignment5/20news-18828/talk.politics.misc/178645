So we try to ensure that the process of deciding whether to introduce
third parties isnt random  As Steve said above there are examples
where third parties are less ignorant or corrupt than the two
primary parties should this knowledge not be able to help

Of course it helps  but only if the decision to involve third parties
is the primary partis to make  A corrupt and ignorant third party
isnt going to say  were corrupt and ignorant  well stay out of this
Pointing out that they are corrupt and ignorant wont help  they either
wont believe you or wont care


 
  Its impossible or at least beyond my abilities to formulate a rule
that will always tell whether the involvement of a third party would be
good or bad  but theres one that seems better than any other Ive ever
heard suggested  voluntary good  mandatory bad  That is  a third
party should involve itself in a transaction ONLY at the request of
the primary participants
 
So we dont formulate a rule that will always tell we try to use
knowledge about other properties of situations  To some of us it
appears that trying always to apply voluntary good mandatory bad
is not only less than optimal it is in some circumstances seriously
damaging  The interesting question is to characterize those
circumstances as best we can

Look  somebody has to have the power to decide whether a third party
will regulate your transactions or not  That somebody is going to
be either you or the third party  You can argue until you are
blue in the face that regulators shouldnt get involved in fact  people
have tried this  they wont listen    The fundamental question you
have to ask is  whose decision is it whether or not to involve regulators
ours or theirs  After youve answered thed first question  you can
try to move on to such questions as should regulators be involved and  if
so  what regulations are appropriate  Although with your answer to
the first question  the second and third are taken out of your hands
