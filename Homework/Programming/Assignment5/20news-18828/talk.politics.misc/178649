 You dumb shit
  
 	Its amazing that someone with your limited vocabulary learned
 how to use a computer Didnt they require you to take English at the  
school
  where you went Or are you just crude by nature
 
 
Im forced to agree with Garrett here  Theres no need for vulgarity
or even hostility  I mean its not as though Garrett asked to be born
dumber than a bag of hammers  While it can occasionally be annoying
there is a noble tragedy to someone with no knowlege of geography or 
preMadonna history thinking that his political views are worth reading  
Something like a hydroencephalic trying to master nuclear physics  
I was the first to note that the population of the PRC isnt gonna
fit into Cambodia unless you puree them so theres no need to keep 
pounding on that idiocy  There are plenty of other idiocies in his post
Find your own and stop hogging mine
 
At first this kind of ranting annoyed me but now its rather entertaining
These kinds of posts dont require ANY facts logic or even sense Its 
kind of like what 10year old kids do on the playground So go on and play
Not everyone on the net is as simple minded as you guys seem to be

Nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has          Garrett Johnson
