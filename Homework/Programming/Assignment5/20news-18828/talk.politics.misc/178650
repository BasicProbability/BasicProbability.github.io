Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

lightly off track but still relevant why all the crying
over the children  I know we are hardwired to consider
the future of the race and comapssionate people are concerned
for all children but so what

For the Branch Davidians the options were to die or
submit to Eviltm  and have their childrens very
souls lost due to the brain washing of the Ungodly
State  to put this in terms the average netter might
	grasp they considered it the equivalent of putting
	Jesse Helms in charge of NEA and MTV

And remembering that in 1983 the Supreme Court Struck Down
Freedom of Conscience IRS vs Bob Jones et al

Whos next

Is your religion  belief system Government Approved

Jim JOnes had won numerous awards from the state before
he moved to Guiana  Obviously state regulation would have
stopped that tragedy too
