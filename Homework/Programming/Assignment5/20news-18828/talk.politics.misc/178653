Subject HE JUST DOESNT GET IT Re will they ever learn

They Refuse To Learn From History Or From the Present

Pointing to Canadas vaunted socialized medical care program he
contends that it is failing even while the cost is catching up with
angry taxpayers He notes Americans dont go to Canada and
elsewhere for medical care its the Canadians and others who come
here Why should the United States duplicate what doesnt work well
in other countries We have the worlds best medical care lets not
mess it up with Hillary Clintons plans for socialized medicine


John F McManus National President of the John Birch Society



When McManus says We have the worlds best medical care I can hardly
believe hes referring to a system

1  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP while there isnt a
    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than
    10 percent

2  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage even though all
    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone

3  Yet Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life
    expectancy childhood immunization rate infant mortality and many
    preventable diseases

4  We pay on average about 1000 each for MRIs  To put that in
    perspective they cost 177 in Japan

5  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on
    health benefits  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere
    else


How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world  The only
thing the USA health care system is good at is showering wellinsured patients
with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it  And
the private system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient
that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every
other sector of society  individuals government and industry

Of the  800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health
care costs last year the Consumers Union estimated that at least 200 billion
was thrown away on overpriced useless and even downright harmful tests and
procedures and the most bureaucratic regulated insurance system in the world

There are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA  But did the
private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork  Ask any doctor
whos had to hire a fulltime clerk to deal with it all

The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP not down  The
competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the
hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment  Spending millions on
expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle
isnt my idea of the worlds best health care system

Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and
expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful  Im especially
thinking of heart surgery and some womens surgeries like hysterectomy and
Cesarean section  Sound like the worlds best health care system



Ever notice how every time someone tries to bring about some real change in
health care the Libbies start bashing Canadas system  First of all Hillary
Clinton is not advocating another Canadian system  I think thats been made
abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months  Where did John F
McManus get that idea anyway

Lets say youre a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border  Your
child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals  The
nearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east and theres an
American city one hour south  Which way are you going to go  Is it because
the American system is the best in the world or just for convenience

It still amazes me that people cant seem to see more than just black and
white on health care reform  There are a million different ways we ould
restructure the system  Its not just a choice between total government
control and total private control  I wish the people screaming socialized
medicine every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM
THEMSELVES on health care issues



The current system sucks  I want to keep providers private but that doesnt
change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we
dont REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM  Purely private health care without any
government intervention doesnt work  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of
nationalizing providers or evern insurers  How can you scream socialized
medicine at her programs  Dont you even know what youre talking about



Ever see Clintons graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the
decade  Notice how the line falls then starts increasing  Why  Ill give
you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we
dont do something about it



PEOPE JUST DOESNT GET IT  The current health care system is a cancer which is
killing our economic wellbeing  Costs are still rising 10 percent a year
even as Americans by the tens of millions go without or are forced into
managedcare programs which are certainly pretty socialized already if you
ask me

A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillarybashers to please
come forward and present no gimmicks straight talk just how THEY would set
about keeping costs down  I didnt get a single answer

The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases
filled with evasive platitudes like give health care back to the people
Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms  What is it about the
current system that you would change and how would that help


How can anyone read the news live under our system and NOT see these faults
How can we deal with the deficit our cities our educational system our
infrastrucure AIDS modernizing our industry etc if we dont quit throwing
away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems


America needs health care reform NOW  Dont just sit there and Hillarybash
inform yourself
