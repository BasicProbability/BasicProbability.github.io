 What was the purpose of this post  If it was to show a mindless obsession
 with statistics an incredibly flawed system of reasoning and a repellent
 hatemonger agenda then the purpose was accomplished with panache

Yes you are  When you and the rest of the homosexual community
pass laws to impose your moral codes on me by requiring me to
hire rent to or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
my will yes you are in my face  Until homosexuals stop trying
to impose their morals on me I will be in your face about this

Gosh I have to associate with heterosexuals against my will every day 
That means youve imposed your moral codes on me now doesnt it 
Fortunately I have taken the time to get to know some members
of the het community and discovered that hey  They really ARENT all evil
elitists with no concept of reality

Ive got a few clues for you  a Im not working to pass any laws  b
Our morals are YOUR morals I imagine you value freedom  So do we  If you
value your own freedom you must necessarily accept that these laws are
important to protect it  After all discriminate in one area and youre
open to discriminate in the rest  c I suggest learning a bit more about
gays lesbians and bis before you post the kind of drivel you have been 
Its obvious that you havent a clue who youre talking about

 
Clayton E Cramer uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer  My opinions all mine
Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all

But not between members of the same sex right  How can you live with such
hypocrisy
