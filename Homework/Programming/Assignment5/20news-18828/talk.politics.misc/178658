Basically I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that
something is wrong with us exists because non african americans dont want to
deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african
americans and that this is about 80 of the problem

There is something terribly wrong however with a culture which
condemns attacks and all too often kills any of its members who
attempt to get an education  My mother is an elementary school
teacher and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
hisher peers of trying to be white and is beaten bullied and
tormented by them  It goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating  In my mothers school one of the most promising young
students who happened to be african american had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs

Nobody who buys into such a culture has any hope of being anything but
poor andor a thug andor dead regardless of their color

What has to be changed is the culture  If that culture cant be
changed then those africanamerican kids who are willing to separate
from it must be separated from it and the murderous thugs of whatever
color  Otherwise future bright young african american girls who
wanted to be doctors will end up dead on the school bus
