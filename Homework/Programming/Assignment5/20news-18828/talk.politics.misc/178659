 Well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself
 
 I reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners  The question here is not of being

That I suppose says a lot about how screwed up you are


No Cramer it does not  In this instance you are telling porkies to
yourself as well as everyone else  Havent you ever been to a
cafe or restaurant and been absalutely stuffed full of goodies and yet
when one more item just a little different with a new texture and
a new taste was presented you somehow found the space for it

Maybe you havent so what  It is a widely reported phenomina and
I reckon the same applies to sex
