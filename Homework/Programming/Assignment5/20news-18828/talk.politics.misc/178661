and the word liberal definitely has a different connotation 
than what you have written above  Just ask Michael Dukakis 

Yeah the Republicans have defined it to mean spends money on things that
dont make our rich buddies richer
	If you have something reasoned and intelligent to say then you should
post If all you can do is rant and rave save it


or maybe they mean that liberals believe in tax and spend rather than
borrow and spend
	True conservatism is cutting spending and taxes Its a matter of
debate just how succesful the last few presidents have been at that


finally it means openminded about things that I dont want to be open
minded about
	I hear it again and again and Ive noticed far more often from 
liberals than anyone else if you dont agree with me you are closeminded
	Look whos talking I suggest you take a look at your post I see
nothing but unfair and unsubstantiated generalizations It suggests that the
author is anything but openminded
	Next time you feel like posting something like this save it for 
somebody who cares
