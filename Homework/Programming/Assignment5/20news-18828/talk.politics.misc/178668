Subject Drug Use and Policy in Japan

Is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in Japan  Im interested
in knowing if Japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs and how they
dealt with it  Ive heard undocumented that Japan years ago used heavy
legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem  Id like to know both
sides of the story  Does anyone recall such a problem  What were laws
at the time relating to drug use drug dealing and drug trafficking  What
are the laws now  What other antidrug measures like education and treatment
has Japan used  How are drugs regarded by the Japanese people  How effective
have antidrug measures been in Japan  Thanks for your help
