Okay but do doctors willingly testify against each other in 
malpractice cases when they do go to court obviously absolutely 
essential to prove malpractice It used to be impossible to get
doctors here to do that A possible advantage of the US system 
you wont hear about from the AMA 

Our doctors monopoly is exactly the same as in the US if not
more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates
but I dont know an answer to this one  Anecdotally my friends
who are MDs including my main buds from high school talk about
how hard it is to turn states witness against someone else 
no direct experience there though

Also in some circumstances you may have to sue the insurance plan
people here after all sue health insurance companies all the time 
I heard about a guy in Alberta who came down with some rare eye 
disease that he had to take repeated trips to Seattle to get treated
It cost him and his family something like 6000 and the province 
years later still has only reimbursed them for 500 or so

Well what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses

Since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable one can
raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which
one is entitled hey not Albertas fault that he lives there  
If he lived in Cheyenne WY his private insurance wouldve told him
to go to hell for the travel expenses and thats that  An HMO would
have just kept quiet and let him go blind

Well yeah tell us about the National Defense Medical Centre
outside Ottawa
 
It serves the same purpose as the Bethesda Naval Hospital  since
not all hospitals can provide everything maybe they have some stuff
that others dont  Ottawas population is only a quarter million
if you include the surrounding counties

My point was that something that should necessarily remain 
unpoliticized has become very politicized to the detriment 
of its mission

I dont think that this has been shown with the DMC 

The problem is in a system where hospitals annual budgets are
approved by the government how do you keep political considerations
out of medical decisions  I bet that if youre an MP or MPP or good
friends with one youre put on any hospitals urgent care list no
matter how minor your problem Which is OK unless youre someone who
gets bumped off the list for some bigshot
 
People of influence will get their way in any system American or
European  Its the Golden Rule  he who has the gold makes the
rules 

But to what extent does it affect the system And why is an urgent 
care list necessary in the first place Its worth thinking about

Its regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get
at what facilities  Dont Americans have to arrange in advance for
operations too  I think that there are two standards being applied
here and that Canada cant give Beverly Hillsstyle treatment to
everybody  Its not a big brother list  its more like calling
around town for a table for dinner 

Yeah but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow 
especially in the hospital business 

Yes and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather
than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the 
next time around  Whether its using mop a couple of weeks longer
or even selling services to Americans remember our system is cash
based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except
in specialties that require larger populations to generate business
why not  The alternative is closing unused wards  business

whether Canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own 
health services catering toward Americans who would be willing 
to pay more than they do is another issue entirely it must be 
noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants 
from the province were getting smaller If those grants are so 
insubstantial why the need to attract foreigners to make up the 
difference

You answered the question yourself  private nonprofit foundations
have to make money somehow and I think that its about time that
they acted like the private hospitals that they are  Personally
Im fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that
their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance
thats one at you Bob Rae

The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield 
the 1314 figure for the US

But dont the US figures include dentistry and optometry where the 
Canadian one until recently anyway didnt

Since we have always been evaluated in an OECD style I dont see
how  remember OECD counts both private and public funds and
in Canada like France and Germany 30 of health care spending is
private funds ie not the basic health insurance money

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse
 
How  They are collecting premiums  and Im an advocate of having
copayments like the French do in their system 

Well if you spend more than you take in you go bankrupt Its that
simple If the provincial insurance systems find themselves paying
out more than they get in revenue they wont be able to pay for
everybodys primary care Yes the infrastructure will be there 
But will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate

Minor copayments can flush out abusers  Remember that our system
is only an insurance policy  But our costs arent rising fast
enough to ensure adequate copaymentsdeductibles  last year
Quebecs userfee proposal came out with the number of 5 as
the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather
than give the QMA a raise  And its not contract time yet as
far as I can tell from UPI Clarinet 

Even the new Reform Party a breakoff of traditionalists from the
Conservatives with a mildly libertarian faction holds our public
health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to
be reminded that its not free the average CanadianEuropean is more
fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these
But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen  but cutting public
spending all over the place and bringing back the death penalty with
little haste if elected

I know that for Petes sake I live right on the border I know the
Canadian system isnt socialized medicine unlike Britains NHS 

Sorry   Its just that I even run into people from Buffalo
and from Michigan who dont know 

The point is that means that if the money runs low in the plan
youre out of luck unless you can afford it yourself

Yeah but thered be a lot of leadtime and a healthcare crisis that
would preclude it  If provincial governments as bad as some of them
are heck we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the
Conservatives in Saskatchewan  embarassing can be so irresponsible
there is still reallocation  health insurance is so important that
its about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent
insurrection outside of the hockey rink  Right now attempts to get
the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like
codliver oil 

Would the private insurers take up the slack Theyd be under no
obligation to Of course they could eventually make money again 
but if what you say is true theyd be loathe to do so and out of
practice in handling such basic services too
 
Some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
American companies and their parents provide full insurance down
here  Regardless all firms up north can easily turn on cable TV
to see how well the American firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage  The private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage  They run around patting them
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras 
for those people who deserve it

Yeah but eventually its going to create a kind of twotiered 
effect that will be noticeable after a while like in Britain 

Most Americans are fearful of a singletier system  

Seriously there are few areas that have sufficient population for a
twomoretiered system like what the French have  a health policy
prof DG Shea has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having
a population of 500000 is necessary for adequate competition 
and in Canada there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes
with that population or larger

Anyways the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those
in the US and barring any future Chernobyllike crisis sudden
transients in spending are unlikely  In fact the health allocation
is one of the most wellbehaved sectors of spending up north so any
talk of bankruptcy is talkradio fodder far away from the border

If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back the
things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like
luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable

This wont be overnight and something like this would force Canada
to have a system more like the French one  but thats not a bad
thing and the change will be minimal ie add copayments and
frustrate the socialists chanting Hey its free
