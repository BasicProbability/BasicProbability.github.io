 The Selective Service Registration should be abolished  To start with the
 draft is immoral  Whether you agree with that or not we dont have one now
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees  Finally the government has us
 on many lists in many computers the IRS Social Security Admistration and
 Motor Vehicle Registries to name a few and it can find us if it needs to
 Maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time
 Lets axe this whole department and reduce the deficit a little bit

Im really surprised Clinton hasnt already tried to do this  He seems
to want to tackle other irrelevant issues first so why not this one as well

Let me say this about that as a retired Navy officer 

I agree Cut it  But lets not stop there 

Eliminate the C17 transport 

Wrong  We need its capability  Sure it has its problems very few
airplanes havent but getting rid of something we need is not the
answer  What do you want to do start over a rebuild a new airplane
from scatch  Itll have its problems as well and there will be calls
again for it to be scrapped  THe other option is to try to extend
the life of the C5s and C141s that are getting extremely old

Scrap the Seawolf SSN21 nuclear submarine 
Ground the B2 stealth bomber 

Itll cost jobs but Im for it  We especially dont need a B2 THe
SSN21 I know litttle about
