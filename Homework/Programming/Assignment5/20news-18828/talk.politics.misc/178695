 These two paragraphs are from two different posts  In splicing them 
  together it is not my intention to change Steves meaning or misrepresent
  him in any way  I dont think Ive done so 

As noted in another thread Limiting govt the problem libertarians face
is insuring that the limited government they seek does not become the 
tool of private interests to pursue their own agenda
 
It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams  Just
as Marxism fails to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
the state is to wither away libertarians frequently fail to show how
weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
condition

		   Patricks example of anticompetitive regulations for
            auto dealers deleted
Heres what I see libertarianism offering you

This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream but basic human decency
and common sense  A real grassroots example of freedom and liberty
And yes not having a few people acting as our masters approving or
rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other does strike me
as a wonderful way to improve the human condition

   Thanks awfully

Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues  As
Ive noted before Im not necessarily disputing the benefits of 
eliminating anticompetitive legislation with regard to auto dealers
barbers etc  One need not however swallow the entire libertarian
agenda to accomplish this end  Just because one grants the benefits of
allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell hisher services without
regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be 
free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention  
As somemany libertarians would argue  

On a case by case basis the costbenefit ratio of government regulation
is obviously worthwhile  The libertarian agenda however does not call
for this assessment  It assumes that the costs of regulation of any
kind always outweigh its benefits  This approach avoids all sorts of 
difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic 
to say the least

I have no objection to an analysis of medical care education 
national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide
a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
than is provided through statist approaches   With some notable
exceptions however I do not see such nittygritty worthwhile 
analysis being carried out by selfprofessed libertarians
