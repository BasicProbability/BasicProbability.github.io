 Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
 better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months

	Firstly they could have backed off  When you put a power freak like
David Koresh in that kind of situation he is going to explode  no pun
intended  Koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands

	If the government hadnt given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened

	Secondly the Davidians were expecting everything the government did 
They thought that they were facing the apocalypse and that they were to perish
in fire  They werent scared of the FBI  They are not the average hoods they
are very devout followers of a religion  PsyOps didnt work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them 

	The BATF should have left at the beginning they should have looked at
Koreshs personality  Instead they thought They have guns  We have bigger
guns  Lets go get em

	They botched it from day one  They shouldnt have been there in the
first place


The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the
Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush

Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy There are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated They set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell

The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish Had they
expected the BD to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one

	The search was a noknock warrent  Meaning that what
those on the scene see is a bunch of men with guns storming 
their compound and lobbing grenades at them  The terms of the
search warrent are secret and the BATF has yet to even reveal
what they were




The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police 

	They did not serve a warrent they basically attacked the
compound and expected a surrender  They had semiautomatics and
concussion grenades that we KNOW about  

	Look at the death and injury toll inflicted on both sides in the first
battle and its difficult to believe that either side had any
superiority in weapons


If anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it
