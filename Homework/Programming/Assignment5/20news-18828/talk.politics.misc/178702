     IT IS A MATTER OF LOGIC that governmentrun systems are
     inefficient and the fact that the highly bureaucratized private
     sector system in the US is vastly more inefficient is therefore
     irrelevant  

	Proof that the entire private sector is vastly more inefficient

 It is for example of no relevance that Blue Cross
     of Massachusetts employs 6680 people more than are employed in
     all of Canadas health programs which insure 10 times as many
     people

	Blue Cross is the government health insurance provider
