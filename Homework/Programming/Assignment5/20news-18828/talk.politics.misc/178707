 A good case A FKING GOOD CASE The defense lawyer asked the victim
 questions like what kind of sexual perversions do you participate
 in  and you think he made a good case

Speaking as someone whos only about six weeks and a 6900 tuition bill
away from becoming an unemployed slob with a law degree Id really like
to see a transcript of this trial  Id especially like to know what
happened immediately after the defense attorney asked that question
assuming that the reports that he did so are accurate Im not
accusing Tom Farrell of making anything up but this is the sort of
case that spawns garbled misquotes false rumors and urban legends like
tribbles  Itd be nice to think that the prosecutor objected
irrelevant prejudicial inflammatory take your pick and that the
judge upheld the objection

	Having watched most of the televised trial I can answer that
when such statements were made by the defense atty the prosecutor did
object and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously
falling under the selfincrimination type of objection  There was
quite a bit of metadiscussion during the trial over the use of graphic
language with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the
exact language  Practically every time the defense tried to get the
plaintiffs to selfincriminate by asking them such questions there
were objections and sustains

	At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about
solicitation for a felony and the judge herself said sustained
before the prosecutor could get the objection stated
