     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
 Note this contradictory title  Gay Activity Low

Not really  The percentage of gays was low  Headline writers arent
noted for accuracy

     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American mens sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 2
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual
 
 The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
 The median number of sexual partners for all men 2039 was 73
 
 Its a shame that we dont have a breakdown for
 straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
 how much more promiscuous gaybi men are
  
 
 Now lets take a quick look at what you are saying
 
 The median of a distribution is that variatevalue which divides the
 distribution halfway ie 12 of the distribution population have
 lower and half have higher variatevalues
 
 So for Males 2039 the median73 this means that half of these men
 are higher than this and half are lower than this  Now if the population
 sample size is 3300 and 1 of them are gay 33 males are gay  If we

Actually 2 were either exclusively homosexual or bisexual  You arent
readiing very carefully

 say they are distributed equally then only 165 are greater than 73
 sexual partners of course this means that 495 heterosexual men are
 greater than 73
 
 Interesting results
