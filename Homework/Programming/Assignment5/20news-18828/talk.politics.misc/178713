Subject Re CLINTON Press release on Clipper Chip encryption initiative

In article 1qvnmkINNoc6lifeaimitedu ClintonHQCampaign92Org The White House writes

                 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY



The initiative will involve the creation of new products to 
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure 
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links



A stateoftheart microcircuit called the Clipper Chip has 
been developed by government engineers  The chip represents a 
new approach to encryption technology  It can be used in new 
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to 
an ordinary telephone  It scrambles telephone communications 
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in 
commercial use today

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary 
information protect the privacy of personal phone conversations 
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted 
electronically  At the same time this technology preserves the 
ability of federal state and local law enforcement agencies to 
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals 

       While also allowing law enforcement agencies to intercept phone
conversations of criminals and noncriminals unlawfully  No Rev
King we arent spying on you

       I wonder how long it will take for the wrong people to put their
hands on the equipment necessary to read this stuff  Itll probably
be as safe as weapons locked safely in evidence rooms

keys numbers that will be needed by authorized government 
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device  When the 
device is manufactured the two keys will be deposited separately 
in two keyescrow data bases that will be established by the 
Attorney General  Access to these keys will be limited to 
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a 
wiretap

       And people to whom they sell them to  All it takes is corrupting
the right guy  No that never happens
