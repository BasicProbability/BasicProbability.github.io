      Bzzzzt  THANK you for playing but obviously you are not reading the 
   material as it is presented  According to the report Ive got in my 
   hands the Newsweek article which reported that 2 to 3 percent of the 
   population is gay used the criteria of No heterosexual contact in the 
   past year  But at the same time the University of Denver study points 
   out quite dramatically that 60 of all selfidentifying gay men have 
  had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year 
 
 I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual 
 contact of any kind in the previous year they are counted as heterosexual
 Even if they didnt intend it that way thats how the figures are being used

Could someone please post some date such as what questonnares where used
and how they were distributed and returned
