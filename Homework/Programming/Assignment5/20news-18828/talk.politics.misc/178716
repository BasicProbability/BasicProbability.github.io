Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and
Vancouver BC  The nongun rates were roughly the same for both cities  The
difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gunrelated  

        And as was not pointed out in the study but in critiques
of it two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come
to mind it was pointed out that the difference was also almost
entirely minority related  That is the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities Blacks and Hispanics primarily while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical

Many of the people who never read the NEJM article believe that this
critique is valid  In fact the study explores the minority issue at length
and cites studies to back up its contention that poverty not minority
type is the relevant factor in violence statistics  

      Perhaps I failed to make myself clear  Minorities in the US
correlate with poverty  This isnt good and we should address it
but we shouldnt ignore that minorities and poverty do tend to go
together

      Does Vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along
racial lines  If it doesnt then assumptions of being able to compare
minority vs majority in both cities is questionable at best


Post hoc ergo propter hoc  Those areas implemented gun control because of
the high rates  

       True only to a certain extent  Take Washington DC where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards  Similarly for New York

Actually I dont know whether any serious studies have been done for both
cities  Usenetstyle statistical arguments are not very serious usually
involving people sitting by computers with the latest World Almanac figures
I had heard of a study on Washington DC that seemed to indicate a significant
drop in gunrelated violence there after the laws were implemented  I heard
Gary Kleck comment on the radio that he thought the decline in suicide rates
was related to the new laws but he doubted their affect on other gunrelated
violence  I have never seen a report on the study nor have any of my progun
friends had much to say about that report  Remember you cant just say that
crime increases indicate a failure of the laws to affect crime rates  You dont
know whether the rate of increase would have been different without the
laws   

       If the rate of increase over a period of several years remains
unchanged or increases I think its not a far jump to say that the laws
are not effective  No you cant sit down and say that things wouldnt
have been worse  I dont have a crystal ball and neither do you  However
that road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique any
action  If it gets down to be It might have been worse without them
then there is no valid objection which Im sure would amuse certain
people to no end

You dont know whether the laws prevented a threefoldincrease or 
failed to stop a twofold increase  

       So weve got a situation where we have several options

	1  The crime rate decreased  Obviously gun control worked

	2  The crime rate remained the same  It would have been worse
	without gun control

	3  The crime rate increased  Perhaps the laws prevented an
	even bigger increase

       Cute testing ground weve got  All responses support the proposition
that gun control works

       The question is this  Did Washington DC experiance an increase
in its violent andor gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern
indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws  If it did then
the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to
control did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws
