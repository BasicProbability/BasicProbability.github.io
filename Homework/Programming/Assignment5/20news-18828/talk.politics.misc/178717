Wait a second youre ignoring major facts here
 
There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant The BATF had a
noknock warrant The initial firefight began when the BATF threw
concussion grenades at the building BATF admits this
 
	When did the BATF say this Everything Ive seen from the BATF
	from the official version to the dissident statements of BATF
	officers who conducted the raid claims that the Davidians were
	shooting at the agents long before they were within grenade 
	range 

	What I saw on TV and what you claim are two different things The
Davidians did not start shooting until after the BATF lobbed a couple
genades in the windows and started shooting themselves

	Also if the warrant is sealed how do we know it was a noknock  

	EASY If you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns
going in throught windows that is a NoKnock warrant Also since the 
videotape shows the BATF throwing grenades before the BDs etunred fire 
you can safely assume that they didnt ring the doorbell
