     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
 Note this contradictory title  Gay Activity Low

Not really  The percentage of gays was low  Headline writers arent
noted for accuracy

But you stated that this study was presented in a very accurate and
dependable way  This is confusing to the issue

And if you read this title it implies that gay sex homosexual sex
activities are low compared to the general population that they surveyed


     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American mens sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 
     2 percent of the men surveyed HAD ENGAGED in homosexual sex and
        
     1 percent considered themselves EXCLUSIVELY homosexual   
        
 									     
Actually 2 were either exclusively homosexual or bisexual  You arent
readiing very carefully

Well let us quibble look at the above statement that you posted I have marked
it with  IT STATES THAT 1 ARE EXCLUSIVELY HOMOSEXUAL IT STATES 2 ARE
OR HAVE ENGAGED IN HOMOSEXUAL SEX

And please not the use of adjective here HOMOSEXUAL SEX

Now I stated that if we take 1 as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint

I believe that you are either 1 you are not writing what you think you are
writing 2 you cant read or remember what you wrote
