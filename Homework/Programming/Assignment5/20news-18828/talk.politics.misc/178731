 I wouldnt worry too much about it though  We are starting to find
 out how politically impotent homosexuals really are  Nonrelevant
 stuff deleted and coming this Saturday they are going to
 wind up with TREMENDOUS egg on their face when I submit no more
 than perhaps 35000 queers will show up in Washington while they are
 promising crowds in the millions  And most of the ones who will be
 there will look like ACTUP and Queer Nation not the guy working in
 the next cubicle  As if thats really going to play in middle
 America

How wrong you will be  I participated in the last National March on  
Washington MOW for LesGayBi rights Oct 11 1987  with a turnout of  
about 750000 people  and we didnt have alot pissing us off at the time   
The big issue was the AIDS crisis but we werent being slapped around  
quite as bad as we are now  This time its AIDS and Equal Rights  and  
the Military Squabble  And this MOW has been in the planning for YEARS  
whereas the last one was pulled together in a relatively short time  The  
last MOW was the largest ever on DC and you can bet we are going to  
exceed that by a long shot  I truly believe we will exceed the 10  
million goal the MOW committee has always had set for this event
