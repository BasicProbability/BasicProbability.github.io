 Recent studies have been all over the map  So have less recent
 studies  None can be said to have shown anything to within an
 accuracy of 110 of 1 as you claim here

This study is from the Battelle Human Affairs Research Centers
in Seattle and was a hot topic in the news last week  The study
questioned at random 3321 men in a face to face interview

This is not a studies but a study  Other studies including the
justpublished Janus Report give very different figures  The Janus
Report figures are not too different than Kinsey 9 homosexual men
and 4 bisexual men

 Earlier studies have been all over the map also  

I think hes talking about Kinsey who came up with the 10
statistic used heavily by gay groups to push their political agenda
Kinseys work has often been accused of lacking a strong scientific
backbone  

Dont be stupid  The Kinsey report is one study so it cant be all
over the map all by itself  Other studies including the Battelle
one have also been criticed  As far as agendas go this is really
chutzpah  Your agenda is obvious
