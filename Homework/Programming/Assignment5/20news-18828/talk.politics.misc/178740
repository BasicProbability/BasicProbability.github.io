 First the median does not imply that half of the men are
 above and half below 73 it simply means that 73 is the midpoint
 between the maximum number of partners and the minimum which is most
 likely zero  

Actually the median is defined as the 50th percentile  If the
median number of sexual partners for men is 73 it means that 
at least 50 of men have had 73 or fewer sexual partners and
at least 50 of men have had 73 or more sexual partners

Question What is 03 of a sexual partner  

To confuse matters more take the following data set

50 60 60 70 70 73 80 90 90 90 2500

The mean arithmetic average of the above set of numbers is 294
The sample standard deviation is 732
The mode is 90
The median is 73

             Its a strange quirk but I hardly ever sing along
                   with people who tie me up   Mork
