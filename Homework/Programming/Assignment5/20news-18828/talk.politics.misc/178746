 Some chump at Brandeis

 I mean how many people actually CARE how many people are gay as long
 as you know how to findavoid them if you want to  I dont

 If you dont care why was so much effort put into promoting the
 10 lie  Because it was important to scare politicians into
 obedience

I wouldnt worry too much about it though  We are starting to find
out how politically impotent homosexuals really are  The Colorado
boycott has fizzled Slick Willie was effectively prevented from
implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his
OWN party this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their
claims of large numbers and coming this Saturday they are going to
wind up with TREMENDOUS egg on their face when I submit no more
than perhaps 35000 queers will show up in Washington while they are
promising crowds in the millions  And most of the ones who will be
there will look like ACTUP and Queer Nation not the guy working in
the next cubicle  As if thats really going to play in middle
America

Sigh  Youre absolutely right  We have no political power whatsoever 
Therefore we should be oppressed and ignored and denigrated right  I
certainly hope you dont have an SO sir because if she heard how
disparaging you are towards political minorities and if she had any shred
of selfrespect shed be out the door


Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
where they belong

Dont count on it sweetheart

 
  The views expressed herein are     Theodore A Kaldis
  my own only  Do you seriously     kaldisremusrutgersedu
  believe that a major university    rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
  as this would hold such views 
   

Certainly not  Most major universities wouldnt touch views that display
the brainpower and the perspective of a mayfly with a tenfoot pole

PS  Incidentally I think even mayflies could come up with more
enlightenment than the above bullshit  Evolve a bit will you
