Subject Re Employment was Re Why not concentrate on child molesters


Wow I hadnt realized how VENOMOUS this was getting  Be careful herethe
problem isnt the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich
rich  Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system
and make money everything ELSE we care about goes to shit  I have to
constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make
money  Money doesnt make us happy it just prevents certain things making
us more unhappy

Therefore dont shoot the rich  Shoot the conservatives
