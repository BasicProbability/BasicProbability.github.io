 I want to know that I have a competent doctor when I am ill  Government
 regulations have driven up costs and decreased quality by providing a
 monopoly for licensed MDs  Many procedures could be performed by
 qualified nurses but doctors are forced to do them  The common cold
 must be diagnosed by a licensed doctor who is the only one who is
 allowed to write a perscription  Doctors are spending much of their
 time on such mundane cases that they cannot have the time to spend on
 the really tough cases  This results in higher cost lower quality
 medical care

Here in Georgia the state legislature in 1992 accidentally passed a law 
lobbied for by Opthamologists prohibiting anyone but a licensed MD from
giving shots They were trying to limit Optometrists from competing with
them
They inadvertantly forbade nurses EMTs dentists and tattoo artists 
from piercing the skin probably diabetics too The Secretary of States 
office announced on June 30th that they wouldnt enforce it pending
reconsideration in the 1003 Legislature In the hassle over the state flag
I heard nothing about repealing it
