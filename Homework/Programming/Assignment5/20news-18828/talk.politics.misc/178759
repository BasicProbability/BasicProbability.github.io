Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage

In article C5L0v1JCvnewscsouiucedu dansuxacsouiucedu Dan S writes
 Dont forget about the culture  Sadly we dont as a society look upon
 homosexuality as normal and as we are all too well aware there are alot
 of people who condemn it  As a result the gay population is not encouraged
 to develop nonpromiscuous relationships  In fact there are many roadblocks
 put in the way of such committed relationships  It is as if the heterosexual

Such as  Not being able to get married isnt a roadblock to a permanent
relationship  Lack of a marriage certificate doesnt force a couple
to break up  This is an excuse used by homosexuals because the 
alternative is to ask why they are so much more promiscuous than 
straights
