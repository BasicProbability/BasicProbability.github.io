 Kaldis writes
 The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear was
 presented as evidence that she was a prostitute and the court
 apparently found this compelling
 
 Ah I know women who wear miniskirts without wearing underwear and
 they are not prostitutes

Do they have a history of working in massage parlors and telling
coworkers there that they are prostitutes  Do they frequent truck
stop parking lots at 400 AM without ID on any sort
