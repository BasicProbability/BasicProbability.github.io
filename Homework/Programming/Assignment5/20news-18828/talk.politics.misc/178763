In article mvpC5rB2HD2Fnetcomcom mvpnetcomcom Mike Van Pelt says
There is something terribly wrong however with a culture which
condemns attacks and all too often kills any of its members who
attempt to get an education  My mother is an elementary school
teacher and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
hisher peers of trying to be white and is beaten bullied and
tormented by them  It goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating  In my mothers school one of the most promising young
students who happened to be african american had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs

You know you have a point here but dont stop with African Americans
When I was in high school in the early 1980s on various occasions I had
knives pulled on me had friends who were stabbed and I was beaten up
repeatedly by those that couldnt accept me as different  And dont
let the teachers off the hook either  On many many occasions there
were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their
wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they
would just watch quietly  All of this was in a nice white middle
class high school  In fact we were so nice and white that we made
sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom
with his white girlfriend  This isnt a race thing its the
way public schools seem to be run

Id hate to be in high school right now  At least I didnt have
to deal with guns just the roving psychodrugdorks and the jocks
withoutafuturebutwithplentyoftestosterone

Id separate everyone who wants to learn from these assholes  But hey
the valuelessness of learning and glorification of jocks is an American
tradition you think anything is going to change  If you have kids
take em out of the public school system and educate them yourself
Thats what Ill do if I ever have them  I wouldnt wish what I went
through upon any kid  Maybe on some of their parents though
