 	Actually I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject
 ie the new inproved survey saying that roughly 1 of men are gay
 on the front page of The New York Times recently I think it was
 on Thurs 15 April  The headline was something to the effect of 
 New Survey Finds 1 of Men Are Gay
 
 	I was shocked not because the New York Times was running a story
 on a sex survey although that was part of it but because they thought
 that this news was actually important enough to warrant front page space
 I mean how many people actually CARE how many people are gay as long as
 you know how to findavoid them if you want to  I dont  

If you dont care why was so much effort put into promoting the
10 lie  Because it was important to scare politicians into
obedience
