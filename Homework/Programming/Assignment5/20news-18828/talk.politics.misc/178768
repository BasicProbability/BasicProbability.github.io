Wait a second youre ignoring major facts here

There was NO attempt to simply serve a warrant The BATF had a
noknock warrant The initial firefight began when the BATF threw
concussion grenades at the building BATF admits this

	When did the BATF say this Everything Ive seen from the BATF
	from the official version to the dissident statements of BATF
	officers who conducted the raid claims that the Davidians were
	shooting at the agents long before they were within grenade 
	range 

	Also if the warrant is sealed how do we know it was a noknock  

Hey dont confuse these guys with facts dude You might break some
beautiful illusions

Of course by BATF admits this they mean that the BATF did not deny some
post by a proKoreshgun lobby person some time back

If anyone wants to understand the paranoid mindset of Koresh I offer you
talkpoliticsguns There you can dredge the sewers of minds so hung
up on power and ego trips that they bend reality arround their own
particular set of beleifs

I long ago gave up arguing the case for arms control directly Instead
I invite people to ask themselves would you want to be in a room full
of the occupants of talkpoliticsguns their personal armouries and
attempt to enter a discussion with them
