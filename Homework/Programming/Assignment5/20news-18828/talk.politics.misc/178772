 I certainly hope you dont have an SO sir

What is SO supposed to signify  I prefer the companionship of a
person not a euphemism

 because if she heard

Thankfully you got the gender right  For I am not a deviant

 how disparaging you are towards political minorities

Sexual deviants do not comprise a political minority

 and if she had any shred of selfrespect shed be out the door

I only associate with girls who do indeed have selfrespect  But were
I to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the
door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
homosexuality I would encourage her to indeed do so and I would
further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
the way out  Who needs such an airhead

 Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
 where they belong

 Dont count on it sweetheart

Oh I cant do anything BUT count on it  After all it is
inevitable for it is part of the natural order of things  Throughout
history nature has always asserted itself  Dont be so arrogant as
to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the
nature of man where practically every other generation has failed
Greater men than you havent been able to do this  The above MOST
CERTAINLY WILL happen no matter how much you may wish to pretend
otherwise

Moreover Im not your sweetheart
 
  The views expressed herein are     Theodore A Kaldis
  my own only  Do you seriously     kaldisremusrutgersedu
  believe that a major university    rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
  as this would hold such views
