  Critisism is too easy What solutions do people have that  would have been
  better than what the FBI had been doing for the last few months
 
 	Firstly they could have backed off
 
 Regardless of who was at fault in the first assault the one in which
 four ATF officers died once that was over backing off was no longer
 an option  The people inside particularly Koresh were criminal
 suspects  They could have made a case of selfdefense if they wanted
 in a court of law  Until then the police had the responsibility to
 capture and arrest them  Ive never heard of a case where the police
 knew there was a criminal suspect in a building and still decided
 to back off  Continuing the siege was one of the few alternatives
 to what actually took place and its a matter of debate whether any
 of these would have ended any better
 

How about letting in the press

How about letting Koresh out to talk to the press

Maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the pressTV for a couple of
days he would have surrendered peacefully


How about letting the relatives of Koreshs followers talk


Seems to me when you isolate someone try to send them crazy by playing
loudspeakers through the night of Tibetan chants etc you dont have
much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy  Im not too
sure of their sanity to start with

I am VERY suspicious when the government controls all communication
and sends the press 2 miles away 
I have a gut feeling that noknock warrant which is sealed would not
stand up to scrutiny

I dont think noknock warrants are what the constitution writers had
in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure
I dont think an allpowerful central hightaxing government was
what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights
to the citizens and states and restricted central government
