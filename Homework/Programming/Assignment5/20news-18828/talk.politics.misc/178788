Subject Re Janet Reno killed the Waco children


In a previous article edwentellnlgov Ed Suranyi says

This too is ridiculous  In no way can the provoker be considered
to have played more than an exceedingly minor role  A person
who kills is ultimately responsible for his own actions


      Frankly Im sick of being lied to  It was bad before Clinton
      and now its worse  Here listen to Ricks  FBI  words
      ONEHALF hour before the fire

        Come out with your hands up  This matter is NOW OVER 

      Now I hear Ricks  and REno  claiming that this was just 
      another incremental step in pressure  More bullshit

      Why did they pick 6 AM  Monday morning  So nobody would
      NOTICE  So everyone would be busy at work starting a new
      week  More bullshit

      Did the FBI hold back fire engines  Here let me paraphrase
      Sessions

        no we didnt hold back the engines  We had them on 
         standby blah balh blah   And so to protect the
         the fireman we didnt allow the engines to enter until
         it was safe 

     WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS    YES WE HAVE NO BANANAS 

     What the HELL kind of doubletalk is this  No we didnt so
     blah balh we did    Huh

     I WATCHED this

     Clinton takes responsibility EVEN THOUGH it wasnt his 
     decision  MOre BULLSHIT  Does he or does he NOT take
     responsibility   No more even though bullshit  Yes
     Or no  

     Christ
