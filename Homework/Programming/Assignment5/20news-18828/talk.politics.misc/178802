FURY OF MOTHER NATURE

Mans contribution to environmental pollution are paltry compared to those 
of nature In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET former Atomic Energy 
Commision Chairman Dr Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data

Atomic Energy Commision  Hmm they would say this


Im no defender of the AEC but it is worth noting that it is unfair to tar
that organization with the decidedly minority scientific views of its
former chairperson and one term Washington governor Dr Dixie Lee Ray
Dr Rays political agenda is wellknown and documented  Likewise her
lack of objectivity in analysing scientific data is wellknown
