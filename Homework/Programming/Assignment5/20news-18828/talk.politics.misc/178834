Subject  Only 17  Month 



	Ahhh remember the days of Yesterday  When we were only 
	going to pay 17  month

	When only 12 of the population would pay extra taxes

	Remember when a few of us predicted that it wasnt true  
	Remember the Inaugural   Dancing and Singing  Liberation
	at last  

	Well figure this out

	5 VAT estimated to raise 60100 Billion per year  on CNN 
	Work it out chum

	     60000000000    125000000 taxpayers  480  year

        But you exclaim  Ill get FREE HEALTH CARE 
	But I exclaim  No you wont 

	This is only for that poor 37 million who have none  Not for
	YOU chum   That comes LATER

	Add in the estimates of the energy tax costs  300500  year

	Plus all that extra corporate and rich taxes that will 
	trickle down and what do you have

	1000  year just like I said two months ago

	And the best part   You dont GET ANYTHING for it

	Deficit is STILL projected to rise at same rate its  been
	rising at by CLINTONS OWN ESTIMATES  And this assumes that
	his plan WILL WORK

	I mean come on it doesnt take a ROCKET SCIENTIST to see
	that in another 2 or 3 years were GETTING ANOTHER WHOPPING
	TAX INCREASE because the deficit will STILL be GROWING 
	FASTER THAN the ECONOMY

	All Clinton is doing is moving us to a HIGHER diving board

        Face it  Clinton is Bush X 2  In four more years our
	country will be completely bankrupt and your childrens
	future so oft mentioned by Pal Bill will be gone

	And those of you still deluding yourselves will be faced
	with the guilt

	Well glancing at watch gotta go  I want to be out of
	here by noon  Got an appointment at the lake  No tax
	there yet
