Subject Re Will Italy be the Next Domino to Fall

NOTE crossposted to altpoliticsitaly and talkpoliticsmisc
 This is a reply to an article by Ed Ipser which also appeared in
 altpoliticsusamisc and altpoliticslibertarian but no longer belongs


I hate to defend Ed the article was very poorly written but here goes

hallamdscomsadesyde Phill HallamBaker writes
Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together
before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget
deficits here None of them are serious on the USA scale

Italys percapita debt is much higher than USAs


We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers
for the benefit of the super wealthy

This is exactly what the public in France  Italy perceive to be the
problem thus the French election and Italian pulizia


Regarding the postpulizia Italy
What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much
better in the next election Most of the parliamentary deputies are going
to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people
who are free of any hint of corruption Look out for a parliament of
Pavarottis and porn stars

Wrong  This is true perhaps only for the Lega Nord
The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a BritishAmerican style
firstpastthepost system in the Senate  If implemented it would
encourage a two or perhaps three party system in Italy
Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties rather there will
be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties
will emerge to dominate  Will Lega Nord be one of these  Who knows

The Camera dei Deputati lower house will likely remain with
Proportional Representation for a while but there is talk of switching a
portion of that house too Maybe as much as 40 firstpastthepost

Overall the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change  Italians
are tired of having crappy government  Porn stars Pavarottis and
Hunters  Fishers wont gain seats because PR is dead  A good twoparty
system will bring Italy efficient accountable government

Its about time
