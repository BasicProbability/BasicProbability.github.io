Let the GREAT CHUCKMEISTER make a couple predictions if you
will

1  The sun will rise tomorrow
2  Rush will bash Clinton on his next show
3  I will turn out to be Clintons love child


     Hey I wasnt the one dancing and singing on Jan 20 now
     WAS I   I was roundly ridiculed for my predictions

     Sure they were easy  TEll that to the other 43 of the people 




     SUCKA     
                
  Made in USA     


Hook line and sinker  chuckle


      Just WAIT until the see what Clinton has planned for 
      their pension funds    This one doesnt take much thinking
       either    Uncle Sam needs money BAD and pension funds got it

      Well they USED to have it  Turns out the states  have been
      plundering state employee funds for the past 23 years  

       Ah its gonna be SWELL
