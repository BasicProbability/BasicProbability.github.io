      It sure does appear that way doesnt it

The attitude that people are stupid if they dont agree with you is not
going to bring you great success in life Free advice there

      whew  Mark what on EARTH makes you think I give a FUCK
      about being a success particularly NOW when Ill just
      the HELL taxed out of me  Oh this is excellent

That was hardly the point was it I was commenting on this alltoocommon
Republican attitude that if people disagree with us they must be idiots they
must be sheep being led around by the Evil Liberal Media Conspiracy This is
a dangerous attitude indeed Because its not a very big step from people
are sheep they cant think for themselves to people are sheep and need
firm leadership from we who know better this sort of attitude makes
me worry about whatll happen to the United States if the extremist wing
of the Republican party ever gets back into power again

      Holy christ 

Hey This is a governmentfunded newsgroup Lets have some separation
of church and state damn it

        Besides lets ahem examine the record shall we

    Broward    Clintons going to taxe the HOLY FUCK out of you 
    Mark       No hes not  Only 17  month 

    I STILL get a laugh out of this one

    Want some more free predictions 

OK I predict that in 1996 the Republicans will STILL be bitter Yeah yeah
I know its not very impressive to predict things that are inevitable

   so I propose that we destroy the moon neatly solving that problem
