On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

    In case you havent noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give 
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps

       Ive read about more than a few of these programs that ran into
problems in convincing parents to get their children immunized even
when they were delivered to their doorstep  I dont know maybe
that sheet they have to be informed of about possible risks side
effects and bad reactions scares them  

    The immunization program is just a useful first step Among other
    things the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a
    a computerized innoculation database on all US children
    codenamed Big Mother Just kidding the name will be Children
    Defense Database or something like that

    Once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved 
    the goverment will have to start knocking down doors in some 
    neigborhoods and bribe parents in others probably the ones that 
    are paying kids for attending the school  what a fantastic idea
