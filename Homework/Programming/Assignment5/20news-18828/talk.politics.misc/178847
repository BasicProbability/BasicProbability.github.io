On the news last night Clinton was bashing the republicans for stonewalling
his so called stimulus package
It seems that one small item within this package was going to pay for free
immunizations for poor kids

Immunizations for children in this country are already free if you care to
go have it done  The problem is not the cost it is the irresponible parents
who are to stupid or to lazy to have it done

I dont know where YOU live but this is not the case nationawide
Perhaps your state or municipality has put together the funds to 
do so but in my area and most areas where I know people immunizations
cost 

    Nationwide the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50 but
    it is reportedly as low as 10 in some innercity neighborhoods
    I bet more than 10 kids living in such neighborhoods are already 
    covered by Medicaid

    Here in Massachussets we have had a universal immunization program
    the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing for many years two decades
    Mass immunization rate is 65  What about the other 35  I guess
    some parents are indeed too ignorant or too lazy  or simply do not 
    care  


Sorry to shatter your stereotypes

    

 
    In case you havent noticed Clintonites are pushing a universal health
    care ACCESS program  Access here means that folks who do not give 
    a damn about immunizing their children will have health care services
    delivered to their doorsteps
