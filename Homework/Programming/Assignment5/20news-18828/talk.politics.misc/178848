When are you going to admit that the data you presented show
just thisthat only about 3 of child molesters are gay and thus are
NOT overrepresented with respect to the general incidence of homosexuality

When someone can show something besides a Redbook article

Correct me if Im wrong but isnt this irrelevant

Either the data shows something or it doesnt Regardless of what other
studies show

Admit it What you SHOWED to us doesnt prove that gay men are more likely
to be molesters
