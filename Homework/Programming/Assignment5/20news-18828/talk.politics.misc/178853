	A judge denied GMs new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact not
from the fire

	Thoughts

	Its kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed 
Shouldnt that be up to a jury

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  Shouldnt that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial

	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective

First people should be aware that Bretts no last name listed 
posts on bitlistservpolitics indicate that he has been  
hostile toward GMs hiring policies and to the Moseley verdict 
when it came out  Equal opportunity disagreement I guess  

My guess without seeing the judges opinion is that GMs motion 
was denied on due diligence grounds  Otherwise a party to a 
case could always keep one or two semicredible witnesses in 
reserve to spring if they lose  Not exactly a way to promote 
repose
