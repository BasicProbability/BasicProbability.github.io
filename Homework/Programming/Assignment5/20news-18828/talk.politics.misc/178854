The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners
The median number of sexual partners for all men 2039 was 73
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  Its a shame that we dont have a breakdown for
straight men vs gaybi men  that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gaybi men are

Possibly because gaybi men are less likely to get married

What was the purpose of this post  If it was to show a mindless obsession
with statistics an incredibly flawed system of reasoning and a repellent
hatemonger agenda then the purpose was accomplished with panache

a Get a clue  b Get a life  c Get out of my face  Im not in yours
