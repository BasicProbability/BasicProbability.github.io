Just TRY to justify the War On Drugs I DARE you

A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took 5 hits of acid

is still having trouble aiming for the bowl when he takes a dump  Dont as

me how I just have seen the results

Boy I really wish we we cut the drug war and have more people screwed up in
the head

Im sorry about your friend  Really  But this anecdote does nothing to
justify the war on drugs  If anything it demonstrates that the war
is a miserable failure  What it demonstrates is that people will take
drugs if they want to legal or not  Perhaps if your friend were taking
legal regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the
position hes in now


I do agree with you in a way  The war on drugs has failed but in my opinion
that doesnt mean we have to give up  Only change the tactics

For instance here are how some penalties should be changed

Dealing Coke  Death
Dealing Heroin  Death
Dealing Pot  Death
Dealing Crack  Death

The list goes on and on

JUST KIDDING

However on a more serious note I do believe that we should take some money 
away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border 
interdiction efforts  Dont think Im going to say spend it to educate 
people because I know plenty of educated dopers  Actually spend it on  
things like drug treatment programs

I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually 
prescribe and addict his recommended dosage and try to ween him off from it
or cut the amount down to levels where it is acceptable  Sounds good so far 
from what I heard with a decrease in cost lower addiction rates by wiping out 
the dealers markets etc But that was the only thing I have heard about it

However legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be 
bought like cigarettes is just plain silly  Plus I have never heard of a 
recommended dosage for drugs like crack ecstasy chrystal meth and LSD
The 60 Minute Report said it worked with cocaine cigarettes pot and heroin
