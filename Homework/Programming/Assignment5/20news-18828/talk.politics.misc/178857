 hire rent to or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
 my will yes you are in my face  Until homosexuals stop trying
 to impose their morals on me I will be in your face about this

discriminate anybody so your argument falls over immediately  Are you

Why not try to eliminate discrimination from existing laws instead of
trying to add discrimination that favors your group
 
Mob rule isnt any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government
It aint charity if you are using someone elses money
