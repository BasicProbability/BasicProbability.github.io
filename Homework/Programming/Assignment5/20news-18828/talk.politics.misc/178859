 I certainly hope you dont have an SO sir

What is SO supposed to signify  I prefer the companionship of a
person not a euphemism

Oh do please try not to be ludicrous  SOSignificant Other a term I employed to avoid the awkward construction girlfriend or wife

 because if she heard

Thankfully you got the gender right  For I am not a deviant

A deviant is someone who does not fit an accepted norm  By that definition I would certainly be a deviant as bisexuality is not an accepted norm in American society so far  This term of course really has no negative aspects inherent in its denotation  I presume you intended it as a term of abuse  Its a great pity you feel such tactics to be necessary but hardly surprising since you have no factual basis for your absurd beliefs

 how disparaging you are towards political minorities

Sexual deviants do not comprise a political minority

May I attempt to emulate your style of discourse with a term of abuse  AhemYou addlepated jellyfish  The post to which I responded was a highly amusing one in which you belittled homosexuals for having no political clout  I would be further amused if you would explain to me why having no political clout and constituting a political minority are different

 and if she had any shred of selfrespect shed be out the door

I only associate with girls who do indeed have selfrespect  But were

And yet you call them girls  The feminists would be up in arms

I to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the
door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
homosexuality I would encourage her to indeed do so and I would
further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
the way out  Who needs such an airhead

Cough cough  Well well you certainly are a fine upstanding fellow you are sir  And like many fine upstanding fellows you have the reading comprehension of a dyslexic anteater  Perhaps I should have been more explicit in pointing out that females constitute a political minority in this country when last I checked and that your obvious lack of respect for these minorities equates to a lack of respect for women  That is of course a conceptual stretch of logic but given your slow uptake as de




monstrated so far I figure we should start simple and work up  Dont worry youll get it
     

 Pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
 where they belong

 Dont count on it sweetheart

Oh I cant do anything BUT count on it  After all it is
inevitable for it is part of the natural order of things  Throughout
history nature has always asserted itself  Dont be so arrogant as

This is very true this bit about nature asserting itself  Homosexuality has always been a part of human society and always will be for that is the natural order  If youre naive enough to believe otherwise go right ahead well try not to snicker too loudly behind your back

Inevitable  Chortle  Anyone would think you had some idea what you were talking about  I havent seen fact one from you and until I do you can just dispense with the bullshit and tell us what we already know that youre a clueless little slime mold with no concept of reality beyond The Donna Reed Show  Live a little and then come back and tell us all about the natural order of things  Youre in a bubble and its really going to rock your world when you come out

to assume that this foolish and misguided generation can change the
nature of man where practically every other generation has failed


Foolish and misguided  Oh this is too much  So which religious figure do YOU believe you are  And how do you know so much about the nature of man  Youre almost too amusing to be worth the effort of crushing your pealike brain      
Greater men than you havent been able to do this  The above MOST
CERTAINLY WILL happen no matter how much you may wish to pretend
otherwise

Gee you sound awfully sure of yourself  Methinks the bigot doth protest too much  Admit it youre scared shitless that what youve been spoonfed all your sorry little life was wrong and youre trying to escape that fear by a blind faith that you know deep down is based in nothing nothing at all  Go ahead clutch your unfounded declaratives to your empty breast ignore the myriad of societies that have accepted homosexuality as equally valid or even mystical  Ignore the solid inescapable fact t




hat weve existed as long as humans have  Fear us  Go ahead  Laugh at us if it makes you feel better  We both know youre just whistling in the dark  Theres one group thats stamped out whenever it appears in any form and thats the group of boneheads who fancy themselves morally superior  Youre in that group and youre slowly and steadily being stamped out  Preach while you can little manit wont be long

Moreover Im not your sweetheart

Thats the first truth youve told so far  I dont hate hets sir  Im bisexual and I embrace man and womankind alike  I have nothing against those who dont understand my love  But you deny its potency and validity  You would crush us all human beings to a one in your imagined divinity  Its fools like you that stir my ireidiots with the small minds who cant think for themselves who know nothing about how the real world operates and who hate because they are told what to do and do it like




 sheep who hate everyone who refuses to be a sheep  Youre not part of the norm  Youre part of a minorityYES a minoritywith supreme oerweening arrogance  Your hubris will topple because it always has because those with intelligence know it to be a clowns costume

Wow that was pretentious  I sometimes wonder why I waste my talents on zeroes like you  I really have no interest in continuing this effortless discussion after all this is for me the proverbial battle of wits with an unarmed opponent  Come back with some swordsie factsand we shall do battle  Till then begone from my sight

PS  You were very entertaining however  Have you considered taking this on the road  I hear escapism is back in
