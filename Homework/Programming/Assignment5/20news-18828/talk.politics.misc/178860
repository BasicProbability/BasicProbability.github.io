 	One of you said Nixon didnt use the office of the presidency
   for personal gain
 
 This is a lie The Senate committee issued an indictment that listed
 Nixons crimes The relevant ones were 
 1 Violating his oath of office
 2 ABUSING HIS PRESIDENTIAL POWERS

Personal gain for his own monetary advantage  I dont think
anyone would dispute that he both violated his oath of office and
abused his powers  But thats not for personal gain

 Nothing is as inevitable as a mistake whose time has          Garrett Johnson
