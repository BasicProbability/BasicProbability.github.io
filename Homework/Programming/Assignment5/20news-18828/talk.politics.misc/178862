  	Actually I was rather surprised to see an article on this subject
  ie the new inproved survey saying that roughly 1 of men are gay
  on the front page of The New York Times recently I think it was
  on Thurs 15 April  The headline was something to the effect of 
  New Survey Finds 1 of Men Are Gay
 
 Does anyone else see the difference between 1 of Men Are Gay and 1
 of Men surveyed say they are gay  Does the NY Times think that
 there is no one in the closet

I see  When survey after survey show 14 we are supposed to believe
ONE survey done with very poor assumptions with a very atypical
population 40 years ago when the society was FAR more repressed about
homosexuality than it is now  Yeah right
