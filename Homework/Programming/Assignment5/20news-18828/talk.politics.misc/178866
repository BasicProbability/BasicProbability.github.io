I find it very interesting that you say there will be 25 million
queers in the march on Washington  The largest figure Ive seen in
the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers 

For another thing 1 of 250 million is 25 million not 6  Maybe
thats where you got the 25 million number  Also the number cited
in the actual report is 15 so that would be about 375 million

As for this march on Washington I wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time  Last time for the
proabortion rally they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up  That and all the stories coming out of how
the press slants the news really makes one wonder whos watching
the watchers

Why are you all playing these pathetic number games  The number of people
showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace  I doubt
that it constitutes more than a handful of us  Im queer and I wont be
there simply because I dont have the time or the transportation  What the
hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum
number

Face it people were everywhere  There are always more of us than you
think  Our numbers are constantly GROWING not diminishingsome of your
children will grow up to join us  Hell some of MY children may grow up to
join us  The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and
blind yourself to it but to realize that you have nothing to fear  Were
not perverts were not dangerous were just here and were human just
like youer most of you

Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like  It wont do them one
iota of good

PS  I still cant get over the fact that some people actually believe that
every queer in the US would show up at the MOW and that these numbers are
meaningful  And come to think of it what about those of us in OTHER
countries  Tree
