     Male sex survey Gay activity low
 
     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American mens sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago shows about 2
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual

The politicians will have plenty to be scared of in one week be it 1 or
90

 2 It will be interesting to see the reaction when 25million queers
    gather in Washington DC After all if there are only 6million of
    us then this is an event unprecidented in history

But many of the people who will be marching arent homosexuals but
other members of the leftist agenda

Im sure there will be a few non queers but the vast majority are
queer

I find it very interesting that you say there will be 25 million
queers in the march on Washington  The largest figure Ive seen in
the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers 

For another thing 1 of 250 million is 25 million not 6  Maybe
thats where you got the 25 million number  Also the number cited
in the actual report is 15 so that would be about 375 million

As for this march on Washington I wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time  Last time for the
proabortion rally they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up  That and all the stories coming out of how
the press slants the news really makes one wonder whos watching
the watchers
