You might  except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than
straight men  which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are

Your starting to sound like a little child who wants ice cream If you
kick and scream enough you think people will believe you Sorry proof
by vigorous ascertion doesnt hold any water I can insist that cats
are dogs all day it doesnt make it so
