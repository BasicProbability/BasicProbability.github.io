 I never knew that soldiers were supposed to salute any civilians except
 for the CommanderinChief 

The CINC is not a civillian
 
 
 Ding Ding Planet Earth Calling
 
 I will Agree that CINCPac and CINCLant are NOT CIVILIANS
 but the CINC is still the president and unless things have
 changed a whole LOT with the Arrival of the BIllaryKlintonKlique
 I dont recall as how the Current President Gots Himself
 Much more than CIVILIAN STATUS1

As far as a member of the Armed Forces is concerned the
President is whatever the hll he wants to be All of them
recently have rather insisted on being treated as something
other than a mere civilian

 If it Moves salute it
 If it Dont Pick it Up
 If You cant pick it up Paint it

So if Hilary were asleep at the time

 1 Nothing personal Jeff but I LIKE living in countries
 where the Head of State is a CIVILIAN it sorta limits
 the habit of using the Military as the First Choice for
 solving domestic problems

I like living in a country where the head of state is not
a military officer too But this point about not using the
military as the first choice for solving domestic problems

Didnt they go after these Branch Davidians with a tank
after all
