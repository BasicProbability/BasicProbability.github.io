     A new natonal study on male sexual behavior the most thorough
     examination of American mens sexual practices published since
     the Kinsey report more than four decades ago
 
 Right off the bat this information is flawed  Most throrough  Im
 sorry but Masters  Johnson put out a report within the past few
 years  The Kinsey Institute has been quite active since it was
 founded ohsomany years ago  They too recently put out a new
 report on sexuality

I was quoting a news story  I have no idea why they claim this was
the most through examination

     shows about 2
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual
 
 I hate to be picky but lets do the math  If we take the cities of
 New York City and Los Angeles alone we can find approximately 35
 million gay peoplemaking about 175 million gay men

WHAT  Even in San Francisco the Dept of Public Health estimates
that only 11 of the male population is gay  What you are claiming
is that of the 16 million people in the NYC and LA areas that more
than 10 are gay  What is the source of your numbers  Keep in
mind that attempts by CDC to determine homosexual percentage in
American cities have given numbers 3

 1 of the American male population is about 125 million
 
 So what this study says is that all gay males live in New York City or
 Los Angeles and about halfamillion people are lying about being gay
 
 Something smells funny

Yes your 175 million number smells funny
