  Absolutely nothing seeing as there is no table for heterosexuals
  If as you claim the supposedly higher promescuity amongst homosexual
  males makes them an insurance risk you need to be show that
  heterosexual males are less promiscuous than homosexual males
  Without the data on heterosexual males we cannot make a comparison
  between promiscuity rates of heterosexuals and homosexuals

 Well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself
 
 I reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners  The question here is not of being

That I suppose says a lot about how screwed up you are
