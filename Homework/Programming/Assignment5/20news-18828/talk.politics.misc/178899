	After going to great lenghts to describe the people inside as hostages
of Koresh eg people leaving escaped and stating that generals have no
place in law enforcement it appears that Janet and the FBIATF have egg on
their faces

	80 hostages dead

	Two unsuccessful assualts

	Janet some advice go with the SEALsDelta ForceGreen Berets next
time and talk nicely to the generals

  This might be illegal without a very specific Presidential declaration
or even a change in law In general sic US military troops are not
permitted to be used for domestic policing operations


	BTWdoes Janet think that military police are oxymorons
