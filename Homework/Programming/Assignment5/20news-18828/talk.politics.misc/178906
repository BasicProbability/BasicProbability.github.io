 Well the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
 if the oppertunity presented itself

 I reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
 huge variety of willing partners

If true and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference I would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than onetenth what it is for
straights  Somebody correct flame me please

I cannot believe I am posting in this thread but what
the hell he asked for it

I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing
I was bi  So what 90 of everyone else is straight Id never
end up with a guy anyway  As several people on socbi pointed
out to me this is true only if you find partners for relationships
or just for sex in primarily straight circles  Nowadays with gay
culture quite visible in major cities and such you can easily
find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so
choose  About half my friends are bi and thats just from
hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a
week its not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in
bars or something

So the available pool for dates can be the same size  Unless of
course youre trying to date a random sample of the US population

As for promiscuity Ive traded email with Clayton on the topic
and he still doesnt seem to want to admit that yes gay males
are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because theyre
closeted and cant afford to be seen in a permanent relationship
Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messedup gender
roles in our society and when males are dating males and theyve
all been trained to be the aggressor in sex theres going to
be more sex  Or that whats dysfunctional whats screwed up
is societal attitudes not gay sexuality and thats what 
encourages deviant behavior in gay males

also note that just because someones had 200 sex partners 
doesnt mean theyre promiscuous  yes it sounds ridiculous
but its quite possible for someone to go through a heavily
closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with
strangers and then come out start forming real relationships
and be monogamous or nearly so
