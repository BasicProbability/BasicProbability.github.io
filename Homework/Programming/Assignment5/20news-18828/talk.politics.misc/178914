Youre not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one 
insurance plan
 
No it is optional  as it is optional for doctors to accept it
There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for
exemptions and one email from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton
verified for me that it is indeed negative option  I guess that you
can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance but
so far Ive not come across that up north  and I take pains to keep
tabs with news from home

Its optional but what if you dont want basic coverage on the 
governments terms You said before that if you opt out youre 
basically uninsured

There are two things at work here  the public insurance is very
wide in what it will cover as the amortization is also universal
No private plan can boast of a plan that fits a Gaussian curve 
and as our private sector has discovered theyre better off not
offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use


And that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an
effective cartelthey dont really need to compete because as you put
it theyre in a winwin situation and theyre guaranteed to turn a
profit 
 
Believe me they probably had orgasms when they figured that out  And
according to my sister the yuppie they pat themselves on the back to
the point of ungraciousness at Chamber of Commerce luncheons

So in a sense theyve stopped being truly capitalists if they dont 
have to worry about competing anymore You might say that the total 
effect is one of socialized medicinea government providing the basics 
and a cartel providing the extras There is no alternative to the system 
desirable or not

The alternative to the system is no system at all patients opted out
doctors opted out or both  But that only for insurance  and you
cant force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they
will not offer  And remember that the actual health care is delivered
by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily
Again they cant force a private entity to spring to life to pay them

Plus there is the matter of culture and values  Im basically
antitax and antigovernment by Canadian standards  yet I cant
bring myself to make the same arguments as you do despite that I
understand where youre coming from  Up north youre so much more
likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health
insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage 

Interesting side notehave any new insurance companies started
upfrom scratchsince Medicare became standard in Canada
 
I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I 
no scratch that  there are a few in Western Canada and quite 
a few in Quebec as part of the post1980 Quebec Miracle out with the
nationalism in with the French capitalism  La Groupe des Cooper
antes built a new tower by the Eatons store at Les Terraces and if
you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBSs Crimetime youd see it as
the welllit one with doubleturrets at the top  As for Ontario
which still dominates and anchors business up north 

I meant new companies not new buildings

Yes primarily in Quebec and in Alberta  Sorry I musta lost you in
that verbose blurb 

Its not really insurance if you dont have alternatives
 
Well you have to realize that in our society thats like saying
that its not really national defence because you cant hire
your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist

True but I would be more comfortable with a system in which basic 
care provided by the government was optional not mandatory

In Canada and Germany its not mandatory  However it is negative
option in that you must request the exemption  That the private
sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option
as in the Quebec case tells me something about what they know 

Either way the transient situations are hard to deal with since the
changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower
rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp in the light of
disasters eg Chernobyl or bad luck a sudden wave of heart
disease A doctor needs 46 years of training plus internship 
and specialty training

Another problem with the US system that should be resolved Doesnt 
Canada have something like ten times the proportion of GPs to specialists 
that the US does

Yes but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are
too small to sustain many specialists sometimes not even one so
you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid  And if you do get
the training the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a
licence because there is already someone in the business and who
cannot fill hisher appointment book  That we have a CMA doctors
monopoly is something that the American AMAoriented medical lobby
NEVER tells you down here 

The problem is in a specialty your skill often directly correlates
to your pay a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate
cardiologist more than it does in general practice In that
circumstance its hard to blame people for going into specialties

No I respect people who do specialties okay all of my MD friends
are  but theres the question of our small market dynamics up
north  if anything that our private doctors and hospitals sell
their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate
their effective population served and thus make some specialties
finally viable ie there will be enough customers  We just do
not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise

I personally think an approach like Germanys would be bestwhere the
companies compete for batches of people Rochester a little east of
us was able to get almost all of its population covered that way

Uh  Germany basically uses our method with their many sickness
funds  The competition is fake if it exists at all because theyre
all interlinked  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern my girlfriend is in
our German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in
Saarbrucken  no ads for health insurance  While Canada organizes
by province Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations
and regional offices   But remember that we have provinces that have
the same population as some major German corporations  Germans have
public health insurance just that it is brokered by smaller entities
actually brokerage of basic by private firms wholl sell extra
insurance to fill out their policies sort of a voucher system
was one of the first ideas floated in Canada too

Remember the Germans dont have HMOs  a telling sign cos
Rochester does and theyre also a company town

But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said
Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs which require
spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches Mickey Kaus
in the New Republic probably spoke for most Americans when he said
Who needs that I think people here generally like to believe they
can easily get the most hightech treatment even if they really cant
afford it

Ill have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim but
Ive come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about
our system  If much or some of it were true youd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it  And given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory
governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still
chafing they wouldve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things  think about it  After all we are using the US as a
metric to make comparison  both for keepingupwiththeJoneses
as for confirming that we did something right
