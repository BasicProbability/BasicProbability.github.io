Were Number One in percentage of population without health insurance 


The main reason were Number One in  percentage of population without
health  insurance  is  that were last  in  percentage  of  population
covered  by public health insurance Only about one fifth of Americans
qualify for the main types of public health insurance available in the
United States Medicare Medicaid and veterans benefits2l

Of those  who dont  qualify many  have private  insurance22  But
almost  one  in  seven  Americans  34  million peoplemost living in
families with a working adult have  no insurance  at  all and one in
four 63 million have been without insurance for a substantial period
of time during the last two years Many more have inadequate coverage
meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness23 In fact
one  health  care  expert  says that because  only 1  percent  of  the
population  has   private   longtermcare  insurance  virtually  any
American could be  impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness24
Additionally as many as  40 percent of those  eligible for some forms
of public aid do not  receive  it These  gaps in health  care  result
directly from  the  fact  that  the  United  States is  the only major
industrialized  nation other than  South Africa without  a  national
health insurance  plan providing  universal coverage while controlling
costs
