  For those who still doubt what is going on this is
  from the still uncensored AP wire
  
  Two journalists from Houston arrested at gunpoint and
  cuffed and jailed for taking pictures of the compound today
  Later released on bail but cameras and film were confiscated
  
  jh
 
 	You could work for CNN  Take a few lines from a story and
 imply something with it but dont say what you really mean  
 
 	The police always close off the area around a major crime
 scene to keep evidence from being disturbed
 
     By taking pictures

	They leave foot prints they may drop some trash on the
ground and they may pick up something that looks interesting

 
  and it is a misdemeanor
 to enter the closed off area  One of the photographers also quickly
 spun around with a long lens camera while the officer was approaching
 a good way to get shot  
 
     Well that hopefully depends on what country one is in

	It has nothing to do with the country  You are coming toward
someone in an area where there has been violent confrontations and
one guy spins around quickly with an object that looks like a gun
Police are not trained to stand there and let someone gun them down

 There was also no indication in that story
 that they wouldnt get their cameras and film back after getting out
 of jail
 
     Once goverment agents have had an opportunity to check 
     the film out

	Youre making statements that are not supported by facts
Dont let paranoia get the best of you  Wait to see if the reporters
dont get their film back or they get it back developed before
screaming conspiracy

 
     I think it was Barry Goldwater who once said the goverment
     that is big enough to give you everything is big enough to
     take everything from you  You life andor freedom including
     Of course that could not happen to you could it

	Our government is not big enough to give you everything
despite the efforts of people like Bill Clinton  Taking a statement
like that and thinking everything done in the name of law enforcement
is wrong is simple minded and ignorant of history  A government is a
necessary evil and we must decide what it should be allowed to do
based on facts history and not by baseless claims
