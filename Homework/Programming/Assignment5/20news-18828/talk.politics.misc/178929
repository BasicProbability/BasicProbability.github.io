Again they cant force a private entity to spring to life to pay them

So the government by sheer economic force has basically cleared the 
basiccare market for itself The only way to test this would be for 
some really daring person to start up from scratch in Alberta andor 
Quebec a health insurance company offering basic care

Crazy Yes but thats almost how MCI got started
 
However the concept of risks is well known by insurance actuaries
and no private firm can get the kind of amortization that the public
pools can get  And since health insurance gets spent that doesnt
sit well with the insurance CEOs  and you get a situation like
in the US where rates keep going up to catch up

See what I mean Its a government monopoly

Sure  because its a nonmarket phenomenom and the free market
cant solve it  Even our private insurance says that 

And remember  last year Quebec proposed giving the least risky
parts of basic care to the private sector  and they balked

Like you saidwhy should they

 and wants no part of it

By your own arguments if you dont want the provincial plan
youre basically up a creek
 
Yes  but in our culture arguing against it is like arguing
for national defence by means of warlords

True According to polls Ive read usually in the sort of simpleminded 
stuff you were initally responding to something like 60 of Americans 
would like Canadianstyle health care whereas only 3 of Canadians 
would like it our way Id be interested to know why there are that 
many 3 of Canadas population is about a million or so people 

Canada is saturated by American media  While pundits come on cable
and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be what
people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see
portrayed on American television in movies ie same infrastructure
different insurance makeup  Yet they know not of any insurance
problems and have no idea of what an HMO is  but having lots of
British TV as well they know that they dont like NHS

Someone must have a reason to argue against it valid or notwhat 
kind of people are they

The polls that you refer to for the Canadian data are from the
annual July 1st polls conducted for Macleans our major English
newsmagazine by Decima Research  Decima president Allen Gregg is
considered one of the worlds top poll researchers and Mulroneys
Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of
impossible election situations  The American polls are Harris polls
and have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again
Im sorta suspicious myself cos maybe Americans want universal
coverage like Canada  I honestly doubt that most Americans realize
that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals ie
similiar health care infrastructure and our system is basically
pure insurance without HMOs

Given recent turnarounds by the HIAA endorsing universal coverage
and hostility to corporatist HMOs within the AMA and the complete
silence vis a vis Canadabashing by the AMA I suspect that theyre
keeping the secret about Canada up their sleeve

Exactly Wouldnt you

Until the idea of managed competition arose there was no direct
threat to standalone private practice  In the 1960s the AMA
fought HMOs as corporatized socialist medicine  part of the
reason why we have only insurance and no HMOs in Canada cos
that was part of the deal cut with the CMA

Ive also read that the three biggest American HMOs can be compared
straight up against some of the smaller Canadian provinces in the
Maritimes and they spend something like 300500 less per patient
Maybe it does help
 
The American HMOs can still cream and they probably cover a smaller
geographic area than even our smallest provinces  Geography again

Some of them are spread out across the whole country I think

But each site is probably compact and the clientele are creamed
And dont forget that HMOs place caps on your coverage and often
wont tell you about additional procedures you could get otherwise
despite that you might be willing to pay for it
