 Item number 1  in a previous posting you stated that you had found
 overwhelming support for child molestation in socmotss

 You have finally responded to this one  I have read your complete file
 of postings to socmotss and to put it bluntly it does not support your
 assertion  In short this claim is bogus  Thank you for confirming this

All those postings in defense of adults having sex with children and
you just choose to claim that they dont say anything of the sort
Theres no point in discussing this any further then  You are clearly
a liar without morals of any sort prepared to justify child molestation

Clayton are you really an idiot or do you just play one on USENET

You claimed you had postings from a dozen ie 12 socmotss posters that
supported child molestation Point aside that they were really defending
abolishing or modifying the age of consent laws or the right to be ATTRACTED
but dont act upon desires for children

so 12 out of thousands is an overwhelming majority

You never cease to amaze me

And you still havent told me why my relationship with my partner is immoral
