Subject Waco Investigation Paranoia

Can people please stop the I thinkknow the BATFFBI are completely
responsible but theyll cover it up so that the investigation will
show that Koresch is responsible bs In an investigation of this
size with the feds state and civilians involved in the
investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up
And with Republicans like Arlen Spector calling for investigations
this isnt going to be handled with kid gloves
