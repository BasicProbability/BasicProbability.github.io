  Can someone tell me why when Mr Cramer spouts on about homosexuals
  he only addresses homosexual men and never in any post Ive read
  addressed lesbians  Granted I stopped reading all his posts long long
  ago so perhaps I missed something 

 Because women very very seldom molest children

Unhunh  Yeah  Right  Sure

You know that list of things that are stereotypically American  Mom
apple pie etc  You dont hear too many stories about Mom being
a child molester because such stories would simply be unAmerican

But that doesnt say that it doesnt happen
