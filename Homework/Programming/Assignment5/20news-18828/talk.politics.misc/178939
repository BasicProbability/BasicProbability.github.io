Eliminate the C17 transport 

Wrong  We need its capability  Sure it has its problems 

If you read Aviation Week the C5 line can be reopened and the C5s
would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the 
program Politically though the C17 is popular pork

I do read Av Week and dont remember this  Could you supply the date
of the magazine  As for C17 vs C5  the C17 cant carry as much
but has more capability  read  can land at smaller airfields of which
there are more of  than the C5  Now is the C17 pork  It depends
on whether your job relies on it or not    In California right now
I would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many 
people are out of work 

The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down
a pork happy Congress
