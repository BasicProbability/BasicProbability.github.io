 What kind of witnesses  If we are talking about witnesses who were at
 the accident or were otherwise directly involved eg paramedics
 emergency room doctors etc then they should have been used at the
 first trial  You dont get a new trial because you screwed up and
 forgot to call all of your witnesses

	They are two witnesses who didnt come forth until after the first
trial  While it would be tough luck for GM if they new about these witnesses
beforehand IMO this constitutes new evidence

The test isnt whether GM knewotherwise that would reward GM for its
stupidity  The test is whether GM reasonably should have known of their
existence  It works both waysif GM had won the trial and the plaintiff
turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should
have been located beforehand too bad so sadno new trial

Like Tim said you dont get a new civil trial because you screwed up 
the first time around  Unlike the criminal justice system repose is
much more important in the civil justice system
