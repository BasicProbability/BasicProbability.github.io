 Just TRY to justify the War On Drugs I DARE you
 
 
 A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took 5 hits of acid 
 is still having trouble aiming for the bowl when he takes a dump  Dont as 
 me how I just have seen the results
 
 Boy I really wish we we cut the drug war and have more people screwed up in 
 the head
 
 
 Ill answer youre sarcasm with more sarcasm
 
 	Boy it looks like the WOD is WORKING REALLY GOOD to stop people from
 	being screwed up in the head given that example
 
 Issue your friend got his drugslegal or not legal hell continue to
 get them  Issue 2 why should I as somebody who does NOT use illegal
 drugs and who IS NOT screwed up have to PAY for this idiots problems  Hes
 not doing anybody any harm except himself  The WOD on the other hand is an
 immediate THREAT to MY life and livelyhood  Tell me why I should sacrafice
 THIS to THAT

And not only that but if the drugs were legal we could have pharmacists instead
of pushers selling them and the pharmacists could be obligated to not only
inform the purchasers of the dangers of drug use but also show them how to use
the drugs in relatively safe ways  And the dangers of impurities responsible
for much of the suffering that drugs cause would be all but eliminated
