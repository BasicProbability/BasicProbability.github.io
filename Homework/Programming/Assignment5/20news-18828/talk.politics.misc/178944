 Let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues  As
 Ive noted before Im not necessarily disputing the benefits of 
 eliminating anticompetitive legislation with regard to auto dealers
 barbers etc  One need not however swallow the entire libertarian
 agenda to accomplish this end  Just because one grants the benefits of
 allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell hisher services without
 regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be 
 free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention  
 As somemany libertarians would argue  
 
 On a case by case basis the costbenefit ratio of government regulation
 is obviously worthwhile  The libertarian agenda however does not call
 for this assessment  It assumes that the costs of regulation of any
 kind always outweigh its benefits  This approach avoids all sorts of 
 difficult analysis but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic 
 to say the least
 
 I have no objection to an analysis of medical care education 
 national defense or local police that suggests a free market can provide
 a more effective efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
 than is provided through statist approaches   With some notable
 exceptions however I do not see such nittygritty worthwhile 
 analysis being carried out by selfprofessed libertarians  

Excellently put

Even as a libertarian I have to admit government does do some things I
like  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft  Lauderdale
that was partially built with tax dollars I dont know how much was
private and how much was stolen I mean public but it is beautiful and
I enjoy it  Keep in mind though most of the people in the city will
never attend a single performance there so they might feel differently
about having to help pay for it

However I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to
give government interventionpower on a casebycase basis  In fact
we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely
because it is not decided on a casebycase basis as much as other
issues  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the
sidewalk in front of the post office  They do not try to decide just
whether pronazi prochoice prolife or protax political speech
should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office  You can
imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority
on a casebycase basis

Not so with economic issues  Government does tell taxidrivers exactly
what they can charge but not the bus lines or the lawyers

Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a
casebycase basis we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a
casebycase basis

There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with
free enterprise  But there is no hope in my opinion of having a
government that interferes with free enterprise in an efficient
manner I call it political market failure

Thus if you value freedom and the abundance it produces you have to
swallow the whole libertarian agenda
