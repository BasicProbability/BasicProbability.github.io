You think that you all have it badhere at good ol Southwest Missouri
State U we have 2 parties running for student body president  Theres the
token sororityfraternity faces and then theres the president and vice
president of NORML  They campaigned by handing out condoms and listing
their qualifications asI listen really well  It makes me sick to have
a party established on many of the things that are ruining this country like
they are  I think Ill run next year

Well a student body president cant exactly campaign on the stand
that hes tough on crime  Their job is to listen to what people want
and fund things that make sense

Condoms and marijuana arent exactly the worst things to have available
either
