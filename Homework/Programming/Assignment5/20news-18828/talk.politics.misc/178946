Just TRY to justify the War On Drugs I DARE you

A friend of mine who smoke pot every day and last Tuesday took 5 hits of acid 
is still having trouble aiming for the bowl when he takes a dump  Dont as 
me how I just have seen the results

Gee the War on Drugs has been going on for all these years and theyre
still getting drugs  Imagine that

My friends who like grass I dont agree but its pretty harmless are
unable to get it yet I know a number of places where someone stupid
enough could get crack cocaine within a half hour of leaving my office

The War on Drugs has been completely unsuccessful yet its lead to really
horrible abuses of peoples COnstitutional rights  I dont see how a
thinking person could justify it
