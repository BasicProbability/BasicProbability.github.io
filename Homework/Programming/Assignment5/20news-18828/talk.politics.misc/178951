	No Im saying any long term investor the ones likely to have large
capital gains would be foolish to sell in order to avoid a tax hike that a
might disappear in any given year and b be overcome in a year or two by
accumlated gains

To which my response isso what  Not all people who pay capital gains
taxes are long term investors  More than enough of them arent for there
to be huge blip whenever capital gains taxes get raised
   I never said that everyone would find this advantageous  I said that
more than enough would for the result to be readily noticeable and distort
trends
 
 Even if Bretts eventualreturn figures were correct  and they
 clearly werent  hed still be wrong about the cause for the 86
 blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors

	You misunderstand  Im not trying to prove a cause for anything 
Merely pointing out that Teds assertion that the blip in revenues was
caused by selling to avoid the tax cant be proven

 1 As Ted notes not everyone is a longterm investor  One might find
 oneself as I did in late 1986 anticipating expenses in the near term
 that require selling off holdings  Given the choice between waiting a
 few weeks and taking an extra tax hit or selling in December with
 preferential tax treatment only a fool would choose the former

	Not disputed

 2 The fact that Brett can now construct post hoc calculations of
 what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects
 beside the point  There was plenty of Moneystyle advice given to
 unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to sell now and save on
 taxes  In case anyone missed it there was no shortage of similar
 advice late last year in the NYTimes eg even though that advice
 was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law as in 1986
 but merely on the assumption that Clinton would raise tax rates
 without capping CG taxes contrary to the current proposal

	It works for any situation  If you believe the market is going up
dont sell

	If believe its not sell  But then youd be selling anyways wouldnt
you

	So where is the evidence that a large number of people suddenly decided
that the higher taxes meant they should sell before the year was out

	There isnt any

	Teds saying that the increase over the previous year is proof of
that proposition but Im saying you cant know that the trend of increasing
capital gains revenues wouldnt account for a lot of that increase
	1986 was the height of the housing boom remember  People were
trading up like mad

 Its nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal
 economic interest  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless
 pulleys though this sort of thinking often fails to describe
 accurately what happens in the real world

	Indeed
