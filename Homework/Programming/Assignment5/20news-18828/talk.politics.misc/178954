      Well it seems the National Sales Tax has gotten its very

      own CNN news LOGO

      Cool  That means well be seeing it often

      Man I sure am GLAD that I quit working  or taking this 
      seriously  in 1990  If I kept busting my ass watching 
      time go by being frustrated Id be pretty DAMN MAD by 
      now
      
      I just wish I had the email address of total gumby who
      was saying that  Clinton didnt propose a NST 


Actually Jerry Brown essentially didand Clinton in his demagogue
persona condemned Brown for it in the crucial NY primary last year

However

Why dont the Republicans get their act together and say they
will support a broadbased VAT that would have to be visible
the VAT in Canada is visible unlike the invisible VATS they
have in Europe
and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
the Clintons enough revenue for their health care reform 

       The Republicans are in general fighting any tax increase
There is also worry that a VAT would be far too easy to increase
incrementally

       BTW what is different between Canadas tax and most of
Europes that makes it visible

and
force an agreement with the Democrats that the top income tax
rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
be increased only via a national referendum

       This would require a constitutional amendment and Congress
enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that
Besides with the 23 majority necessary to pull that off youd 
have a difficult time forcing anything like that

Why not make use of the Clintons to do something worthwhile
shift the tax burden from investment to consumption and get
health care reform and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
all in one fell swoop

       Primarily because its a practical impossibility to freeze
tax rates

       However this is something that bothers me  Were always talking
about consumer confidence and consumer spending as gauges for the
economy  If they really are important wouldnt shifting taxes to
consumption provide a disincentive to spend money
