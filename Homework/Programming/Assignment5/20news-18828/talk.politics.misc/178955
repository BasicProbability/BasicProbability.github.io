Subject Just what is in the JobsPork bill

This was in Wed WSJ

start
The white house seeking to mount public pressure on GOP senators bombarded
news outlets in some senators home states with news releases warning that
certain projects may not be funded if the 16billion stimulus bill isnt
passed

None of the projects mentioned are actually in the bill rather they are
part of a wish list that may be funded from the 256 billion in
Community Development Block Grants



end

I could have sworn I heard a bunch of Clintonites going on and on raving
about how dishonest it was that the Rebublicans were taking items from this
wish list in order to ridicule this bill Now that Clinton is using that
same list in order to garner support for the bill are you guys going to
do the honarable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest
 
Mob rule isnt any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government
It aint charity if you are using someone elses money
