Eliminate the C17 transport 

Wrong  We need its capability  Sure it has its problems 

If you read Aviation Week the C5 line can be reopened and the C5s
would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the 
program Politically though the C17 is popular pork

I do read Av Week and dont remember this  Could you supply the date
of the magazine 

Aviation Week March 15 1993 p48

the CBO estimates that matching the capability of 100 C17s would
require 70 C5s at a total cost of 144 billion This option is still
more than 10 billion cheaper than completing the C17 program which
the CBO estimates will cost 247 billion

Sorry I was nine billion off The C5s would be ten billion cheaper
  As for C17 vs C5  the C17 cant carry as much
but has more capability  read  can land at smaller airfields of which
there are more of  than the C5  Now is the C17 pork  It depends
on whether your job relies on it or not    In California right now
I would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many 
people are out of work 

Well California voted overwhelmingly for change right
The argument to continue military programs just to support jobs is
a poor one Its kept quite a few bases open that should have been closed
years ago wasting billions of taxes

The question is whether Les Aspin and Clinton will be able to face down
a pork happy Congress
