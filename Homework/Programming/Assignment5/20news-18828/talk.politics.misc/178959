Subject Re California Insurance Commissioner Endorses Federal Legislation to Protect Consumers from Scam Insurance Companies

In article 15389optilinkCOM crameroptilinkCOM Clayton Cramer writes
   You mean since your philosophy took over the economy has almost
   collapsed
  
  Excuse me my philosophy  You dont have any idea what my philosophy
  is  The American economy has had its ups and downs through a number of
  prevailing economic philosophies  But then economics is hardly a science

 In my lifetime your philosophy  socialism masquerading as a liberal
 welfare state  has been in ascendancy

Yoearth to Claytonmy philosophy  I have never discussed this with you
I know its a minor point but gee dude you have no idea what economic
and political principles I adhere to  But dont let that stop youyoure on a
roll  Just ascribe to me whatever you wantI know youll choose wisely
After all I do believe in personal responsibility

  No I mean exactly what I wrotethe welfare system of the New Deal is
  wholly inadequate to cope with the current state of affairs

 Absolutely  So the response of socialists is take us even further
 into socialism

Duh  What else would you expect a socialist to do

   Flashinthepan  No your subculture has utterly dominated the
   TV and movie industries for two decades now

  My subculture  My were getting personal  The only subculture I see
  dominating the TV and movie industries is money  If youll buy it
  theyll sell it  And as recent movements to boycott TV advertisers have
  shown theyre very sensitive about what sells  Whatever happened to
  personal responsibility anyway  Or am I personally responsible for
  the decline in that too

 To the extent that people have been encouraged to NOT be responsible
 for themselves yes

a Just when and where have I encouraged people not to be responsible
for themselves  Be specificbut do make up random dates and heinous
acts as you see fit

b You and I have encouraged many people to do many things  How does that
in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions  Is there
a finite amount of responsibility so cf conservation of energy as
I become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual
perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so  At what point does the
perpetrator become completely innocent altogether  You know this lends
a whole new meaning to the term the moral high ground

   Oddly enough all the unskilled or semiskilled people I know manage
   to find employment almost immediately  Maybe she needs to move to a
   cheaper part of the country where jobs are plentiful and the cost
   of living is lower

  The west side of Chicago is about as cheap as it getssqualor city
  Tell me about all these places where its cheap to live and jobs are
  abundantIll pass them on

 Sonoma County

I will pass the info on  Out of curiosity what kind of jobs would these
be  Whats the demographic mix wrt race age culture

  lots of employment and utterly surrounded by socialists  Well I suppose
  thats the sort of environment that would attract socialists or at least
  not dissuade them

 No its that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists  all the
 spoiled rich kids feeling guilty about their wealth  But not guilty
 enough to give it away  they just look for politicians to take MY
 more limited wealth away

Lifes a bitch aint it  Man youve got to get out of Fornicaliahave
you considered someplace perhaps geographically distant but politically
more friendly to you like say Indiana  Or maybe Utah

  Well I doubt that much of this goes to drugsthere isnt much left after
  buying food and there is very little in the first place  Sure you read
  about such cases now and then but thats what makes them news  Show me
  your statistics about AFDC abuse

 I can tell you that relatives I have known the drugs came first the
 food was secondary

I dont doubt it but unless you can show me statistics to the contrary
I will persist in my apparently dogmatic socialist belief hey if you say
so that most AFDC money really doesfor better or worse in the long
termfeed FDCs
