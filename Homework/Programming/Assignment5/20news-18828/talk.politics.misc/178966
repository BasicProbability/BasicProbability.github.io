We are not winning the war on drugs  I think you can see that one
of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that
the war on drugs is being won is to selectively quote statistics
only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone
down  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is
an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to
deceive the public

Unfortunately theres not much we can learn from the statistics presented
here either  Due to rounding the 1991 est for LSD could be anywhere
from 550 to 649 and the 1992 est could be anywhere from 850 to 949
This means that the actual change if you believe these statistics in the
first place was anywhere from 31 to 73  Similarly the increase in
cocaine use could be anywhere from 18 to 66 and the increase of
crack use could be anywhere from 29 to 120  This doesnt even
take into account the margin of error which isnt provided here

This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded
but it does mean that USA Today has not surprisingly provided us
with virtually no information
