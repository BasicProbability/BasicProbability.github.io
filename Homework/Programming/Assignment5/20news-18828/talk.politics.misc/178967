Subject Re New Study Out On Gay Percentage

Clayton Cramer writes
Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters Johnson
and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population  

Did you ever consider the selection effect that those who are willing
to admit to being a member sexual minority homosexuality are more
willing to admit to being a member of another sexual minority highly
promiscious 

I didnt think that you did
