	If you look through this newsgroup you should be 
	able to find Clintons proposed Wiretapping Initiative
                     
	for our computer networks and telephone systems

	This initiative has been up before Congress for at least
	the past 6 months in the guise of the FBI Wiretapping
        
	bill

What kind of brainless clod posted the above garbage Would they be
so kind as to explain how this is Clintons initiative when it
has been before Congress for at least the past 6 months

Jeez the next thing you know theyll be blaming the weather on the
poor guy Theyll be blaming World War II on him Theyll be blaming
the Civil War on him Maybe the Thirty Years War
