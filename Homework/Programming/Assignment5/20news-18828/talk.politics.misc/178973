This country is hardly ruined In fact it is booming compared to after the
1980 election

This whole USA has gone to hell and ReaganBush caused it is not only lame

pathetic and old its wrong

Under ReaganBush the economy grew by 11 trillion dollars  This is more tha
n
the entire economy of Germany a kind gentle country in many peoples
books  What a joke

Drive down to Cincinnati and take a look  Not pretty is it

But drive UP to Cleveland and it is about 10000 times better  I from Toledo 
originally but that place always as sucked as long as Ive been on the planet

Things were much better there in 1980  All that growth went into
the hands of Ron and Georgies pals and I DIDNT GET A SINGLE
DIME OF IT DAMMIT  And now Im gonna be bled to death by tax
leeches to pay for the damage  Fing great

Republicans have been trying to pass a balanced budget amendment for the last 
ten years


Oh heres another thing  Seems like a lot of people in
Columbus drive over to Marysville and make Japanese cars  Hm

Because for a while the American companies coulnt even compete in THEIR OWN 
COUNTRY where free trade isnt even an issue  However even the automobile
pendelum has swung back to the Big 3

I wonder how many Americanowned companies employ those in
Central Ohio  Other than Ohio State University  

Oh I dont know  Its probably in the tens of thousands
