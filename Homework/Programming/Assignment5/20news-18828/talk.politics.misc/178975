 	Clinton has backed off from the 16 billion jobs bill
 
 	Word is hes paring it down to the core jobless benefits money for
 creating full time jobs ie no summer jobs money
 
 	Chalk one up for holding the line on spending

	It seems radio reports were overly optimistic  All Clinton wants to
cut is 25 Billion for community block grants keeping in summer jobs

	Hmmm well looks like we need to keep up the pressure on our
congresspersons
