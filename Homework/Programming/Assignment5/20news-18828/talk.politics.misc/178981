 Above quote from Rushs radio show yesterday when he referred to recent events
 near Waco Texas
 

Me either Yes its regrettable that eightysomeodd people died but
they could have walked out the door with the simple turn of a knob Its
just plain stupid to lay the blame for this at anyones feet but ol Vernons
If the FBIBATF started the fire why did it take six or so hours to catch
Timed incendiary devices you say Could those idiots not have picked them 
up and tossed them out the window And what of this argument about whether
a wood burning stove was being used Its a known fact that when a city is
under seige the citzens thereof eat what they can how they can Hell
the BDs couldve had MRE type grub for all any of us know
My conscience is clear
 
 Does the word smolder mean anything to you  Several minutes can go by
 before a smoldering cigarette butt in a couch sets the couch on fire
 Heres a possible maybe very possible scenario  one of the CS gas
 grenades that the FBI threw in earlier caused some material like the
 drapes or carpet to smolder for an extended period of time  Later
 on when a tank punched a hole in the wall knocking over one of the
 BDs kerosene lanterns kerosene spilled onto this smoldering material
 resulting in a fire that killed 86 people inside  Another possibility

And this results in a fire that starts in one room and torches the entire place
before anyone in the adjacent rooms can escape  I dont think so  So much for
the smolder theory
