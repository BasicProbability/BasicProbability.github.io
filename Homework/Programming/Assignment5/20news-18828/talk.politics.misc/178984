 a good way to get shot  There was also no indication in that story
 that they wouldnt get their cameras and film back after getting out
 of jail

	Oh theyll get it back with exposed film 

	Shortly after the Rodney King episode a woman here in Dayton used a
camcorder to tape the police arresting several youths

	Upon noticing her the police arrested her for jaywalking and
accidently erased the tape while they had it

	Yep theyll get their film back allright

	Theres nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an
intellectual conviction  Sean OCasey in The White Plague by Frank Herbert
