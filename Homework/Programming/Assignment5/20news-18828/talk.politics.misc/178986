MotorVoter stuff

	My friend after the election brought up the point that it
would enable more people to vote however since it makes it easier to
get to the place of registration  He brought up the analogy that if
there were only ONE place to vote say in Alaska would it be
excessive and wasteful to petition to have more places to vote  This
is a similar idea a way to encourage more people to vote by making it
more easily accessible  I not knowing where I stood played devils
advocate and said  well would you have the taxpayers money go to
busing for those people that have trouble making it to DMV then
Where does the right to vote merge with the right to vote easily
Where should we draw the lines  

       Well there does have to be a line  And to be honest extending
voter registration to DMVs is hardly analogous to having only one
place for registration in Alaska and opening a new one in Atlanta  More is 
not always better once youve passed a certain point

	My friend said that that is obviously an extreme and that
actually the motorvoter bill would SAVE money because no longer would
the city have to pay someone to sit in the town hall and spend all
hisher time filing those things theyd just be at the push of a
button or the filling out of an X at DMV  So I actually someone
else but theres no need to confuse this anymore countered again
saying that wouldnt congress as always get exorbitent budgets and
fund committees to orchestrate and oversee the implementation the
argument went back and forth forever ranging from whether or not its
BETTER to have more people voting whether that is even relevant
etc

	just looking for some more opinions  Anybody got em

       I thought the Motor Voter bill passed

       In any case my experiance with Tennessees voter registration
system which you can register with by mail by the way is that nobody
who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration
All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrants
part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to
it  Once you register its good unless you miss for years worth of
elections of move

       Its easy to register now  I simply dont see the value in going
out and trying to get people registered who dont have enough gumption to
even write and have the proper forms sent to them   How can we expect
responsible decisions out of these people
