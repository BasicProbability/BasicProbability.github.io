 BBC world news service on shortwave originating out of London
 reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank when
 making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
 lamp and that is how the fire started  Attempts were made by the
 people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly
 
 Were hearing it  It sure rings true its consistent in a way that
 mass suicide by fire is not  This survivor is also saying that they
  
 It rings true
 
 There was a separate report that an overhead helicopter which was recording
 the entire incident on video tape has a visual record of SEVERAL files
 I think the number 3 was mentioned starting at different parts of the
 compound

Has this video been made public  The FBI spokesman also said they 
first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out but
later said that three different FBI agents saw BD members starting
the fires

Also the FBI claims to have listening devices bugs in the compound  
Will they make public the tapes of what the BD said

 To me this attempt to blame the FBI for starting the fire simply looks
 like an attempt by a survivor to shift blame away from the BDs
 
 I think it is a crock

Well sealing the initial search warrent keeping the media miles away
not letting the BD talk to the public making contradictory statements
not releasing the vidio  tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence 
in their actions
