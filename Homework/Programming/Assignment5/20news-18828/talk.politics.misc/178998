When are you going to stop lying and admit
that the whole crusade is based on your own personal hatred fear and
obsession  You need help Mr Cramer

The saddest thing is that most people like Cramers wife learn dislike
for homosexuality early in childhood

Clayton however is so impressionable that he let his wife sucker him
on this issue as a fullgrown adult
