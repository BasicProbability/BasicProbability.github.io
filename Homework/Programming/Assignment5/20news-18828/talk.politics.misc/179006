Were hearing it  It sure rings true its consistent in a way that
mass suicide by fire is not  This survivor is also saying that they
were trapped inside by the damage done by the tanks

	Why is an accidental fire more plausible than a mass suicide 
	considering that the Davidians were an apocalyptic cult with
	a history of armed violence If the FBI has reason to lie 
	about the cause of the fire if it resulted from their own
	negligence then the BD survivors also have reason to lie if
	they started the blaze 

The FBI claims the fire was set simultaneously in three places  They
claim the building was filled with tear gas  Electricity was cut off
tanks were rolling all around  How did the BDs coordinate the
setting of the fire 

	Its fairly simple It was decided to burn the place down
	and more than one agent was dispatched to set the fires in
	separate parts of the compound I doubt that simultaneously
	means at the exact same time in this case It likely means
	close enough together to preclude them from being part of
	the same fire


The FBI claims that men with torches set the fires but havent released
any evidence of this though it seems inconcievable that they dont have
any if it was true

	They might be waiting until the evidence comes in from the
	site and the investigation is at least well underway 


All of the BDs
previous actions were aimed towards their survival not their death

	The same could be said of Jonestown

The idea that kerosene lamps would be all over the place with
electricity cut off makes sense  The idea that ramming tanks into
the building would spill them and cause a fire makes sense    The
possibility that the FBI wouldnt know this is nil  It wasnt simple
negligence

	Maybe Then again Ive been suprised at what folks have missed
	in the past in similar situations Dont jump t oconclusions
