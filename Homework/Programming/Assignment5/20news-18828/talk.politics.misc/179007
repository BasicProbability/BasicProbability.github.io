	Why is an accidental fire more plausible than a mass suicide 
	considering that the Davidians were an apocalyptic cult with
	a history of armed violence

Because the place was a tinder box with straw bales for insulation and they
wouldnt have time to die from smoke inhalation before the fire reached them
Those people burned to death a truly horrible and agonizingly painful way to
die which I dont think even a fanatic would willingly inflict on himself let
alone his family 

	You dont know much about the fall of Diems government in Vietnam
	Or the traditional Indian practice of Suttee People have been
	burning themselves to death or willing to go through such and end
	for political and religious reasons since the beginning of time
	Also death from smoke inhalation is little better than dying from
	the flames themselves Think about breatning in searing toxic
	gasses Its not pleasant
	

To anyone who remembered Jim Jones and who thought that mass
suicide was a real possibility selfimmolation would simply not be the method
of choice

	Then again to a Buddhist monk it might be To each his own

Far more likely to be bombs bullets or poisoned koolaid  Thats
not to say they definitely didnt do it  I dont make claims either way  but
I find the idea implausible enough to want to see the govt thoroughly inves
tigated to determine if they started the fire by accident 

	Im waiting to see what the government has too
