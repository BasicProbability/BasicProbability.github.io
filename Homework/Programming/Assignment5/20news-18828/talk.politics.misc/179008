	Blue Cross is the government health insurance provider

	Oops
 
 Oops  Blue Cross may well be the insurer for government workers in
 Massachusetts as it is for a number of state and local governments I
 dont know  But Blue Cross is certainly NOT a government agency  
 It is a private insurer

	Yes it is a private insurer that has to deal with government
regulations concerning how its employees are to be covered processed etc 
There are a mountain of forms that gov employees have to go through

Sorry but this is a red herring

Are you contending that the mountain of forms are processed by Blue
Cross  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee
and as an employee of a private corporation I saw no difference between
the two sets of forms  

Moreover the administrative costs associated with MedicareMedicaid
the two primary forms of government insurance are considerably lower than
the average for private insurance companies   5 versus 1416

If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring
government employees than private employees post it  Otherwise try
to stick to factual assertions


 And as the original post implied it is private insurers in the US 
 whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative
 costs of taxsupported health care systems in Canada and elsewhere

	Only those that remain paperbound and refuse to standardize

Well now thats an interesting defense of the free enterprise system
Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents 
private insurance companies from standardizing

In fact it is true that some of the redtape burden stems from the 
lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US
but its a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than
free enterprise at work  

By the way Barrons the bible of Wall Street this week admitted that
administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because a
singlepayer system is always cheaper  Guess even the free enterprise
advocates are beginning to see the light

 Try again

	Why  My HMO provides good service at a low cost  And I dont have the
government telling my doctors what they can and can not say about medical
procedures

Sorry but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care
reform with the Bush administrations gag order on federally funded family
planning clinics  There are no proposals that would control what your
doctorcan and cannot say about medical procedures

Try again
