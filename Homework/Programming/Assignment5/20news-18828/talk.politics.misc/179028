Well it really doesnt matter anyway because I really dont care what liars
think of me anyway What Did I call you liars You want proof Id be
glad to provide it Im really sure which ones of you said these things 
since you all sound the same anyway 
 
	One of you said Nixon didnt start ANY secret wars
 
This is a lie Nixon had full knowledge of the invasions of Laos and
Cambodia and then lied to the American public about it
 
Note however that these were military actions but not wars

What a JOKE You cant actually believe what you just said Can you We 
bombed and invaded these countries

Notice the definition of war from the American Heritage Dictionary
	1 A state or period of armed conflict between nations or states
This qualifies the invasions of Cambodia and Laos as wars
 
	One of you said Nixon didnt use the office of the presidency
  for personal gain
 
This is a lie The Senate committee issued an indictment that listed
Nixons crimes The relevant ones were 
1 Violating his oath of office
2 ABUSING HIS PRESIDENTIAL POWERS
 
Excuse me but neither of these refer to personal gain

Then let me explain this to you REALLY slowly Why did he abuse the 
powers of his position Could it have been to gain personal political 
power Naw that would be too obvious
 
	So now youre BIG thing that you have been flogging me with
is that I mistook PRC for Peoples Republic of Cambodia Since I knew
that Cambodia was socialist at the time and since your comment was
right in middle of a conversation about Cambodia I made the wrong
assumption that we were talking about the same thing
 
Ah but Garrett anyone who has to make assumptions about the meaning
of the initials PRC in a discussion about Asia is breathtakingly
ignorant  

And anyone who can only call names because his position is defensless is
breathtakingly ignorant and desperate I noticed that you edited out the
other points were I proved you and Phil to be completely wrong


Death to all modifiers he declared one day and out of       Garrett Johnson
 every letter that passed through his hands went every      GarrettIngrescom
 adverb and adjective The next day he made war on articles
 The following day he blacked out everything in the letters
 but a an and the   Joseph Hellers Catch22
