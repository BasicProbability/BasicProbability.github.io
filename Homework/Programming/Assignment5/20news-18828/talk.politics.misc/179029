Here are several shreds of evidence that prove the Waco disaster
is the governments fault

1  They raided an Americans property because of rumors about
    Koreshs intentions with some converted yet still 2ndamendment
    protected firearms a judgeapproved warrant justifies nothing
 
In a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a 
search
 
The US constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to 
mount a search for illegally held weapons

A search for illegally held weapons IF there were any no evidence yet
produced to this effect does not justify firing into a house with
women and children either It also does not justify shooting first
without identifying oneself the ATF and FBI have done this before so
dont say they havent please or producing a warrant

Guess it depends on whose story one believes huh

 
2  It took them 51 days to think of a basic terrorist tactic ie
    tear gas and this could only be justified in support of rescuing
    any supposed hostages inside
 
The Govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases Attempts to 
capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others

Which others are we talking about here

is one In this case they used sub lethal force 

Sub lethal Excuse me but those people are dead

3  The govt immediately imprisoned these socalled hostages
 
The children were held hostage 

Evidence So far the FBI has produced none Dont hold your breath

The adults were wanted variously for murder and conspiracy to murder

Only a few of those being held in chains and shackles are wanted  
The rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses

4  It took hundreds of govt agents with taxfunded cellular phones
    ten minutes to dial 911 for the fire department
 
They should not have called the fire dept at all There was no role
for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might
well shoot at them

It was not the Feds decision to make but the firefighters

Calling the fire dept meant that WACO was deprived
of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation 
where it could have been used arisen

This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by
ANY citizen Since fire departments do answer calls that deprive 
resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for
not calling them

Further since the Davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in
a court of law they are subject to the same protection as any other
citizen And las far as I know even criminals in prison are not left to 
burn to death in a fire

5  By cutting off the water supply in the surrounding area the govt
    guaranteed that any fire at the compound would be fatal
 
Any fire started deliberately uising lamp oil is likely to be fatal

I guess this is a matter of religious faith with you The government
says it so it must be so Or havent you been reading this thread well 
enough to notice that some of us here dont beleive their story

6  No one had the foresight to station rescue vehicles nearby in the
    first place
 
They are a scarce resource A bunch of psychos cannot deprive the neighbourhood
of a resource that might be required in a genuine case

Patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires either
Besides as I explained some of us here believe their distress might
have been genuine Are you SO certain it wasnt

7  The govt conveniently forgot all that freedom of religion stuff
 
Freedom of religion does not include human sacrifice Nor does it
include other forms of murder

There is no evidence that the Davidians committed human sacrifice 
either before of after the initial raid And selfdefense is not
murder

8  The govt arguably started or at least fanned the fire themselves 
 
The govt arguably is run by communists or the trilateral commission

He did not say it was deliberate Accidents do not require conspiracy
theories only wanton disregard for human life The initial raid alone
agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce
ment procedure proves they did not mind killing people

10 Finally and this may be a stretch for some of you statists out there
    but Koreshs original reasons for holing up in such a compound may
    have something to do with the continual interference from the govt
     new taxes new regulations and increasing involvement in every
    aspect of our personal and economic lives  Life on a compound might
    become the way of the future  it might have to be
 
Let us hope that those who support Koresh are not allowed to enforce this upon
the rest of us 

No one here is supporting Koresh We are opposing the illegal use of
excessive violence by our government against our citizens That is all

Their reasons for supporting the ownership of high power
weaponry are clear enough they hope that this will be the catylist for
the destruction of the fabric of society and allow them to enforce their
nightmare vision of the future

A society that believes it is OK to terrorize people for their religious
views will destroy itself in due time It is the feds who disrupted the
fabric of society in Waco not Koresh It is the feds who forced a
nightmare onto the people of Mount Carmel

It would be a good thing for people to study history 

On what basis do you assume we havent Dont you really mean
It would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from
history that I do 

In particular a group of militant

Militant implies acts of aggression against ones neighbors The
Davidians left their neighbors alone

religious heretics who left to set up such a community
some time ago A few years latter they had captured Medina and destroyed
the idols in the Kabba Within ten years the whole of Arabia was under
Islam

So what The Mormons were considered a cult for years and were chased
out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are
advocating When they finally got to set up a community they left
people alone So far Americans havent been put to the sword by Mormon
hordes crying to avenge Joseph Smith 

Just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be 
left alone does not mean that that is how they will stay 

It doesnt mean they wont either Anyway the whole purpose of a 
system of laws is to punish people for what they DO not what they
MIGHT do 

The Pat Robertsons
Oral Roberts and Jimmy Swaggarts of this world are quite telling other
people how to run their lives

Telling is not the same as forcing When the police knock at my
door I cannot make them go away by changing the channeI As for Pat
and friends I dont even WATCH their channel since I am an atheist
So far not watching them tell me what to do hasnt gotten me killed 

 If you allow such people to get guns and
point them in your face you are likely to find that they are running your
life

Right now the only people sticking guns in anyones faces is the 
government And they are trying very hard to run my life Or 
havent you noticed
