	     Any questions
	     
	     Q	  Is he moving towards some major decision this week 
on Bosnia
	     
	     MS MYERS  As weve said hes continuing to discuss 
his options  Hes been talking extensively with his foreign policy 
advisors his Bosnia advisors as well as with other world leaders  
Hell try to contact President Mitterrand again today and hell 
continue to discuss it  We dont have any specific timetable but 
obviously the situation there is very serious
	     
	     Q	  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont believe hes spoken to her today
	     
	     Q	  Why does he have nothing to say about this publicly 
except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 640 
pm
	     
	     MS MYERS  He did  He answered a question about it 
yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Before anything had happened
	     
	     MS MYERS  Before anything happened  He put out 
	     
	     Q	  Since something has happened hes had nothing to 
say
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hes put out a statement on it last night  
And well have more to say about it later today
	     
	     Q	  In what forum is that going to be
	     
	     MS MYERS  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden
	     
	     Q	  He will talk about Waco at that
	     
	     MS MYERS  Yes hell have something to say
	     
	     Q	  Is that something we can take live
	     

	     MS MYERS  I think it will be brief  We can talk a 
little later about the exact structure as we work it out  But I 
dont know if its something youd want to take live
	     
	     Q	  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as 
well
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hell probably take a few
	     
	     Q	  Is there any reason why he hasnt talked to the 
Attorney General
	     
	     MS MYERS  Ill have to doublecheck  I dont know 
that he hasnt talked to her this morning
	     
	     Q	  And she didnt come here this morning to see him or 
anyone else
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     
	     Q	  And he didnt talk yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Whats the reaction to her resignation statement 
that she made last night
	     
	     MS MYERS  She was asked a question about it and she 
answered the question  The President has absolutely no intention of 
asking for the Attorney Generals resignation  He stands behind her 
100 percent  As you know he was informed about the decision  He 
takes full responsibility for that and stands 100 percent behind 
Attorney General Reno
	     
	     Q	  The question now arises  yesterday we were told 
that he was briefed on this but we never got a firm idea of how much 
he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and 
the justification of the timing  Was he fully informed on all of 
that all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the 
compound that made them want to go now the feeling that nothing else 
was going to succeed et cetera
	     
	     MS MYERS  He talked with the Attorney General about 
the decision about  she talked to him about the factors that led 
to her decision  He raised no objections  He supports her decision 
to go forward with it  He was fully briefed
	     
	     Q	  Of course hindsight is 2020 but looking back 
now does the President does the White House feel that the decision 
he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at 
what actually happened
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think everybody feels bad when life is 
lost  But I dont think that that is reason to secondguess the 
decision  He stands behind the decision that was made  He was 
informed about it  He was fully briefed about it and he stands 100 
percent behind the Attorney General the Justice Department and the 
FBI  Its a difficult operation and theres  it had already gone 
on for more than seven weeks  Four federal agents had lost their 
lives in the line of duty  lets not forget that  
	     
	     This was a very difficult situation and all the 
decisions involved were very difficult  But all the agents on the 
ground the FBI the Justice Department all recommended moving 
forward with this  They thought given the circumstances it was the 
best possible course of action  Theres just no point in second
guessing those decisions  Now I think that theres a reason 
	     
	     Q	  Why not  They have to 
	     

	     MS MYERS  No not to secondguess the decisions  I 
think its important to take a look at it to have an investigation  
I think the President will talk some about that later today  But at 
this  from this vantage point to secondguess those decisions 
its not useful
	     
	     Q	  You sound like hes going to order an investigation 
of what happened and whether 
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think hell have more to say about that 
later yes
	     
	     Q	  He will order an investigation
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hell have more  yes  hell have more to 
say about an investigation
	     
	     Q	  What kind of investigation
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hell have more to say about it later
	     
	     Q	  But in the Monday morning quarterbacking surely 
there is some soulsearching now as to whether it was the right 
decision  You cant say that we did the best we could when it turned 
out to be a rather  a debacle
	     
	     MS MYERS   I think well  obviously well review 
the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome  
I dont think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic  But 
again the President stands behind the decisions that were made and 
well take a look at the factors that contributed to that
	     
	     Q	  What was the FBI Directors role in this
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well he was obviously involved in setting 
up the operation  He signed off on it as did the agents that were 
on the ground that were working with him  I dont believe he spoke 
to the President but Ill doublecheck that
	     
	     Q	  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of 
planning and so forth
	     
	     MS MYERS  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what 
aspects he was involved with
	     
	     Q	  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House 
today
	     
	     MS MYERS  Theres no planned meeting  I dont believe 
that shell be here
	     
	     Q	  She wont be at this event at 115 pm
	     
	     MS MYERS  No no plans to be
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that theres going to be a jumping on 
on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in 
terms of  to the Presidents detriment politically
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well I would certainly hope that people 
wouldnt try to use this tragedy for political reasons  Obviously I 
think again that its useful to look at the facts to reevaluate 
the facts and I think the President will move forward with that  
But I think people understand that this was a difficult series of 
decisions that it was a very difficult situation that it was caused 
by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four 
federal agents   And I think its most tragic that a lot of innocent 

children lost their lives in this  I dont think anybody disputes 
the tragedy of the outcome
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee what was the White House role in handling 
the I guess public relations aspect  in the aftermath  Who was 
talking  who here at the White House was talking with people at 
Justice to set up Renos news conference to do all that sort of 
thing
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think the Attorney General handled her end 
of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the 
news conference once there was a point at which there was enough 
information I think to talk with some accuracy about what had 
transpired during the day  Obviously people here at a number of 
levels were keeping in touch with people at the Justice Department 
and at the FBI to try to keep informed about what was happening 
there
	     
	     Q	  But Reno said that she didnt talk to the 
President and there seemed to be an indication she hadnt talked to 
anybody at the White House  So who 
	     
	     MS MYERS  There were people talking on a staffto
staff level
	     
	     Q	  I understand  But who at the Justice Department 
was handling that for Reno  Who was talking to the White House
	     
	     MS MYERS  There were a number of people  As you know 
Webb Hubbell is the liaison to the White House and I know he talked 
to a number of people here  There were a number of people at a 
number of different levels involved  I dont want to get into 
exactly who had what conversations with whom but there were a number 
of conversations  Obviously the Justice Department was working to 
keep the White House informed the press informed to the best of its 
ability as events unfolded throughout the day
	     
	     Q	  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont believe so  I dont know if he 
talked  he may have at one point
	     
	     Q	  And was the White House role just to seek 
information about what happened or was it to direct the public 
information campaign that followed
	     
	     MS MYERS  It was both to keep abreast of the situation 
so the President could be on top of it but I think the Justice 
Department managed its press relations on it  We were obviously very 
interested in what was happening there throughout the day and the 
President was following it very closely throughout the day
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee on that though if the President was 
following it so closely and he had talked the night before with Janet 
Reno why wouldnt he talk to her at all since then
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again I dont know if hes talked to her 
this morning  Again hes kept fully aware of what has been going on 
throughout the day  He stands 100 percent behind her decisions  
Hes been fully supportive of her as he said yesterday morning 
before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written 
statement
	     
	     Q	  But wouldnt he want to convey those thoughts to 
her personally yesterday
	     
	     MS MYERS  One more time I dont know if theyve 
spoken this morning

	     
	     Q	  No yesterday
	     
	     Q	  Clearly theres a perception that she was left hung 
out to dry all day yesterday
	     
	     MS MYERS  Thats just not true  I think we said 
throughout the day that the President takes full responsibility that 
he stands  I dont know how much clearer we can be  The President 
stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this  He accepts 
full responsibility for the events that transpired  He believes that 
Janet Reno the Justice Department and the FBI acted as best they 
could given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the 
time  I dont know what else he can say to show that he supports her 
1000 percent
	     
	     Q	  One of the best indications of that is to pick up 
the phone and tell her
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again I dont know whether theyve spoken 
this morning
	     
	     Q	  Why cant we find out
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well we can  I cant do it standing here 
right now
	     
	     Q	  Youve got six people here  All theyve got to do 
is pick up the phone
	     
	     MS MYERS  Helen well get back to you
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee when the President spoke with the Attorney 
General on Sunday is it safe to assume that either she volunteered 
or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to 
increasing pressure on the Davidians
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think that they discussed the situation  
Again Im not going to get into the specific details of what exactly 
she told him but I think that he was aware of the risks involved
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the President yesterday morning said it 
was entirely her decision  She then said that she told him what was 
happening and he said okay  Does the President regard it that he 
gave the goahead or that she gave the goahead
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think what they both said yesterday was 
that she made a decision based on all the available facts  She 
informed him about that and he raised no objections  Again I dont 
know how much clearer we can be about that
	     
	     Q	  And he said okay  The issue is over the 
responsibility
	     
	     MS MYERS  He said okay
	     
	     Q	   Does okay mean 

	     MS MYERS  The President accepts ultimate 
responsibility
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the Presidents investigation that hes 
going to announce  would that be conducted by someone outside the 
administration
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     

	     Q	  It would be internal  is it meant to preclude any 
congressional investigation
	     
	     MS MYERS  No its meant simply to follow up on the 
incidents that occurred yesterday
	     
	     Q	  And you would I assume therefore cooperate fully 
with any congressional hearings that would be held
	     
	     MS MYERS  To the best of our ability
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee there are two reports out this morning  
One that the Justice Department or FBI or whomever apparently had 
a bug planted inside the complex  And the other is that the children 
may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either 
left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire  
What do you know about those two 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing more than Ive seen in news accounts 
this morning  We may get more on it later but at this point I know 
 Im not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by 
people who came out of the compound
	     
	     Q	  Has the President received any report today in 
terms of fatalities and actually what was going on  what theyve 
been able to find out on in the compound now
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hes been briefed  I dont think that 
theyve gotten into the compound yet  They were still waiting for it 
to cool off  I dont think theres much beyond whats been reported 
in the news accounts  But he has been kept uptodate on it
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee the President stands behind Attorney 
General Reno but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from 
the socalled experts
	     
	     MS MYERS  He believes that she made  he stands 
behind the decision that she made  It was the unanimous decision of 
her advisors of the FBI of the agents on the ground and he 
supports that
	     
	     Q	  What about the validity of the decisions made on 
the ground  Does he back those 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hes not going to secondguess decisions 
made
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee you just said he stands behind the 
decision which she made  Normally in a situation like this the 
President says I  made the decision  But youre saying she made the 
decision
	     
	     MS MYERS  Im saying that the President was briefed 
about the decision  He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility 
for it
	     
	     Q	  But then why do you keep using the terminology the 
decision that she made rather than the decision that he made 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Because as he said yesterday she evaluated 
the facts based on evidence presented to her by Justice Department 
and FBI which is part of the Justice Department and made a decision 
and then briefed the President on that decision  That is how the 
chain of command works  She briefed him  He signed off on it  The 
operation went forward and the President accepts full 
responsibility
	     

	     Q	  In that chain of command analogy there I want to 
go back to Sessions a moment  Do you know if this was a plan that 
came through him to Reno or was it presented to her around him or 
with his involvement  What was his involvement
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again youd have to go to the Justice 
Department for the specific interaction between the Attorney General 
and the Director
	     
	     Q	  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions
	     
	     MS MYERS  He supports  again I dont know how many 
different ways I can say this  he supports the decisions made by 
the Justice Department and the FBI  He fully supports the Attorney 
General in this  Im not stepping away from the Director of the FBI 
I want to  but Janet Reno is the one who briefed him the one who 
made the decisions as the head of the Justice Department  As you 
know the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General  The 
Attorney General made the decision  She informed the President about 
those decisions  He okayed it  He didnt raise any objections to 
it and he accepts full responsibility
	     
	     Q	  Do you have based on what you know here at the 
White House any concerns about William Sessions performance during 
this 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Nothing to suggest that no
	     
	     Q	  Along those same lines just in your initial review 
of the situation how much do you think the problems might have come 
from not having a Justice Department thats fully staffed and having 
an FBI Director who is still quite uncertain about his status    
	     
	     MS MYERS  I just dont think that had anything to do 
with it  I think the agents on the ground  the operation went 
forward  Im not going to speculate on that
	     
	     Q	  Did the White House express any alarm that Janet 
Reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to 
speak to Clinton
	     
	     MS MYERS   No  She was carrying forward her 
responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday  I 
think she did a very admirable job  The President agrees with that
	     
	     Q	  Before Sunday how often was the President briefed 
on the situation in Waco
	     
	     MS MYERS  He was kept updated on a regular basis on a 
daily basis
	     
	     Q	  Who briefed the President
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well Im not going to get into exactly who 
what conversations he had with whom but he was kept uptodate on 
the events in Waco  He has daily briefings on a number of issues
	     
	     Q	  No no was this a regular briefing conducted by a 
White House staff person or was it by a Justice Department person
	     
	     MS MYERS  Hes briefed regularly by a White House 
staff on a number of issues  Again Im not going to get into 
exactly who briefs him on what subjects
	     
	     Q	  Another subject
	     
	     Q	  On another subject
	     

	     
	     Q	  Now were going to do gays in the military  
Laughter
	     
	     MS MYERS  I welcome it
	     
	     Q	  How close are you to signing the biodiversity 
treaty
	     
	     MS MYERS  As you know the Presidents giving a speech 
on Earth Day tomorrow  Well have more to say about it then
	     
	     Q	  Any details on where or when that speech is yet
	     
	     MS MYERS  Its at 1130 am and I dont know where 
yet
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee is this a major policy address  How would 
you characterize the speech tomorrow
	     
	     MS MYERS  I would characterize it as a Earth Day 
speech  I wouldnt look for any major departures from his past 
positions on these things  But again I dont want to get too much 
into what hes going to talk about tomorrow
	     
	     Q	  On or off campus
	     
	     Q	  Is this at a location outside the White House
	     
	     MS MYERS  It will be somewhere in Washington  We 
dont know exactly where yet
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee what foreign leaders has the President 
talked to since Friday on the situation in Bosnia 
	     
	     MS MYERS  Only Prime Minister Major  And again hell 
try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning
	     
	     Q	  David Owen said yesterday and Joe Biden said today 
 both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work 
that the Serbs are not going to sign on  Does the administration 
still believe that it can work and that they will sign on
	     
	     MS MYERS  Obviously the ultimate goal is some sort of 
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Bosnia  As you know the 
administration is considering a wide variety of options at this 
point  The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of 
Eastern Bosnia is quite serious  And the President will meet with 
his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this
	     
	     Q	  Is that a question theyre going to try to be 
deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable
	     
	     MS MYERS  Again theyll be reviewing a number of 
options including the peace plan
	     
	     Q	  Does the group that hes meeting with today include 
Reg Bartholomew
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont believe hes here  But it will be 
among the usual  Secretary Christopher Secretary Aspin General 
Powell
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee do you have anything on the apparent 
encounter by US F15s over Bosnia today  some aircraft violating 
the nofly zone
	     
	     MS MYERS  No I dont  Ill get back to you on that

	     
	     Q	  Will the President be meeting with every one of the 
leaders coming to town for the Holocaust Museum
	     
	     MS MYERS  He will  Hell be meeting as you know 
with Vaclav Havel today and with Lech Walesa tomorrow and then with 
the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon
	     
	     Q	  As a group or one by one
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe its as a group  Now Havel and 
Walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for 
quite some time  But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of 
state that are here
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee has the President decided whether he 
supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act  And has anything been 
worked out for him to address the march on Sunday
	     
	     MS MYERS  I think hell probably have a letter or some 
kind of a statement to the march  We havent worked out the exact 
details of that
	     
	     Q	  Not a live phone hookup
	     
	     MS MYERS  Probably not given the logistics of getting 
to Boston  The speech as you know is at 400 pm  The answer to 
the other part of your question is no he hasnt taken a position on 
it
	     
	     Q	  You said that speech in Boston was at 400 pm
	     
	     MS MYERS  I believe so yes
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what its on
	     
	     MS MYERS  Well still working out 
	     
	     Q	  General Vesseys coming back tonight from Vietnam  
When will he be meeting with the President
	     
	     MS MYERS  No specific meeting is scheduled  Well 
talk to him at some point and see  We look forward to his report 
but exactly how hell make that report is unclear
	     
	     Q	  So hes not going to come immediately to the White 
House
	     
	     MS MYERS  No
	     
	     Q	  The AIDS czar  how close are you
	     
	     MS MYERS  Still working on it
	     
	     Q	  Drug czar
	     
	     Q	  Do you expect it before the march
	     
	     MS MYERS  I dont have a time line on it
	     
	     Q	  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the 
Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster

	     MS MYERS  As you know the Senate will vote on 
amendments today  Well continue to talk  The President is 
committed to some kind of a jobs package wed like to see it passed  
And well continue in conversations throughout the day and see where

	     Q	  Its become a pressing question for the last 
several hours
	     
	     MS MYERS  No just this minute that Ive been here 
and I havent had a chance to follow up on it Helen
	     
	     Q	  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield
	     
	     MS MYERS  I mean obviously he prefers  he offered 
a compromise package of 122 billion  He believes that thats the 
best alternative believes that hes obviously willing to take a 
second look at the package  And I think the Senate will vote on that 
today and were hopeful that the Presidents bill which will be the 
Mitchell amendment will be the one that will be approved

	     Q	  Well has it been decided how hes going to 
address  Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call

sounds like
	     
	     MS MYERS  Correct

	     Q	  And theres talk about a Joint Session of Congress 
speech at the end of May 
	     
	     MS MYERS  We havent resolved exactly how the
