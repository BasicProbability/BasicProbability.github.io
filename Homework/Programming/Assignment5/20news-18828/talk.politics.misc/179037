 You might  except that gay men are MUCH more promiscuous than
 straight men  which shows how damaged and screwed up gay men are
 
 Okay Claytoon let us say that hypothetically I agree with you that
 gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men  Why does
 this indicate they are screwed up people
 
 BTW  It occurs to me that since in my experience men are much more
       interested in sex than women and want to have sex much earlier
       in a relationship than women do that homosexuals would have 
       sex more often simply becuase their partner is of a like mind
       ie heterosexual men would be more promiscuous if they could

Its my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly
indoctronated into now wanting sex that are men
Also there are definite double standards for men and women who are
promiscuous

Could there also be a factor of communication being more direct in 
homosexual relationships and culture
