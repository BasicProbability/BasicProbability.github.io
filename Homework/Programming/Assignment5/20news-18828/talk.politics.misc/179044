	I cant wait for the investigation  Considering that everyone
is dead now and the place is burnt to the ground I guess honest citizens
will just have to take the word of the ATF about how much of a threat
these people were



         The BATF warrant was unsealed yesterday

         The entire operation was illegal from day ONE


       No authority for a noknock raid
       No authority to use the Texas helicopters
       No authority to search for a drug lab  More ATF lies


       Clinton and Reno are lying fucks
