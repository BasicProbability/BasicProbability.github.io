You are speculating that the FBI purposely started the fire  Please
if youve got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim and have no evidence
whatsoever at least give us a speculatory reason why the FBI would want to
do such a thing

The possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable
but we dont have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now

Mr Kuo I dont recall seeing your byline around much before at least
on tpm Let me clue you in on this newsgroup tpm is populated
largely by people whose hatred for the US government especially
the government of Mr Clinton is literally boundless To these
people the suggestion that agents of the US government would carry
out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens in full view of TV
cameras is not an extraordinary claim Its just another day in
the life of these United States

They dont have to suggest any reason why the FBI would want to
publicly massacre citizens Have you seen The Crying Game 

	Its in their nature
