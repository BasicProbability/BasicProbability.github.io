 The above smacks of antiHispanic bigotry

 You smack of idiocy Td I dont suppose youve heard of Pythagoras
 before

I have indeed heard of Pythagoras but I dont know that he was ever
disparaged as a bean eater  In the American Southwest and West
eg Texas California Colorado the term bean eater is
sometimes used as a slur against those of Hispanic heritage generally
Mexicans in those parts  much like how the Irish in the Northeast
are perceived by some as voracious beer guzzlers
 
  The views expressed herein are     Theodore A Kaldis
  my own only  Do you seriously     kaldisremusrutgersedu
  believe that a major university    rutgersremusrutgersedukaldis
  as this would hold such views
