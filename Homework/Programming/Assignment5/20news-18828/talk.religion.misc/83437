I noticed this dead horse in your Keywords line Is this the famous scarlet horse
of Babylon that the Beast thats 666 for you illuminatti rides on in those
wonderful mediaeval manuscripts If so I fear your announcement that the old
girl is dead may be premature I bet 20 on her to place in the 6th race at The
Downs last Sunday and she slid in a bad fifth So she is not dead She is just
comatose like god that way I suppose
