 Not exactly  The prophesy clearly implies that people would
 still be living in the area but by the same token it would
 never be rebuilt  Obviously  if people are still there they
 would live in houses correct  Their nets implies a fishing
 village  This is exactly what it has become  a far cry from
 its original position of stature 

Lets see if Alexander destroyed Tyre and people move back and
they construct houses and after a while 14000 people live there
and still call it Tyre it is not considered to be rebuilt Instead
its considered to be justsomepeoplethatgottogetherforfishing
andtheyneededhouses place

 So far Ive seen stated figurers ranging from 15000 to 22000
 Lets assume the latter one is correct  By modern standards
 we are talking about a onehorse town

Sigh I was never born in a city then my home town has 10000
people I have to consult my city and inform them that its from
now a fishing village When this city Kristinestad was founded
in the 17th century about 1000 people lived there so the norms
were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities
along the coast of Finland

I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the 
small fishing place of Tyre in Acts Again maybe he was a keen
fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre 

Cheers
