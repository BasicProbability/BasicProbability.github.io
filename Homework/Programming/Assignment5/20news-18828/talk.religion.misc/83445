	It can not be a light which cleanses
	if it is tainted with the blood
	of an innocent man

   now showing how Brian Kendig is in the dark of the 
most fundamental basic of the Old Testament  Concepts like
santification and Lev 1711 must be foreign to you  Too bad
you are not interested in understanding  Too bad you prefer
blurting folly even to your own shame

  Lev 1711 For the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given
  it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls for it is
  the blood that makes atonement for the soul

The Old Testament was very big on the eye for an eye business  It
makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to repay
moral wrongdoing

I know about sanctification  Ive been taught all about it in Sunday
school catechism class and theology classes  But even after all
that I still cant accept it  Maybe Im still not understanding it
or maybe Im just understanding it all too well

From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent
man is wrong  Ive tried repeatedly over the course of several years
to accept it but I just cant  If this means that I cant accept the
premise that a god who would allow this is perfectly good then so
be it

     What ignorance you can show us next  I guess Ill wait
till tomorrow

If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a good thing
then I would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me
Be warned however that Ive heard all the most common arguments
before and they just dont convince me

                            netre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent
    The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre
     is that it ends                                            Rousseau
