                              TRANSLATION

	In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and
material opulence and who are bewildered by such things the resolute
determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take
place
  
                                PURPORT

	Samadhi means fixed mind The Vedic dictionary the Nirukti
says samyag adhiyate sminn atmatattvayathatmyam When the mind is
fixed for understanding the self it is said to be in samadhi
Samadhi is never possible for persons interested in material sense
enjoyment nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things
They are more or less condemned by the process of material energy
