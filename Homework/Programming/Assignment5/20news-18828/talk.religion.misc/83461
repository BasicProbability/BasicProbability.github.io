Subject An invisible God

 God CAN be seen
        And I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my backparts
        Ex 3323
        And the Lord spake to Moses face to face as a man speaketh to his
        friend Ex 3311
        For I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved
        Gen 3230
God CANNOT be seen
        No man hath seen God at any time John 118
        And he said Thou canst not see my face for there shall no man
        see me and live Ex 3320
        Whom no man hath seen nor can see 1 Tim 616
