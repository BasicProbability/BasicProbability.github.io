Subject Re After 2000 years can we say that Christian Morality is

In article 1qjcltnh7horusapmchpsnide frankD012S658uucp Frank ODwyer writes

 

 as I recall I first entered the fray on this matter in response to
 an assertion by Simon Clippingdale that morality was relative

Oops Quite right I got so busy that I saved Franks last post back then
intending to respond when I could and I sort of forgot Ill try to do it
soon if anyones still interested and probably even if theyre not

 Is he therefore trying to sell something  I dont think so 

Well yes maybe I am Im trying to have people buy and take on my opinions
thus causing said opinions to spread in timehonoured memetic virus mode until
the world is a veritable paradise So how about it folks As they say over
here You Know It Makes Sense
