 Objective morality is morality built from objective values

You now pushed down the defintion of objectivity into realm of
objective values So you need to explain that as well as well
as the objective subparts the objective atoms quarks
Firstly science has its basis in values not the other way round
You keep saying that I do not think it means what you think it
means
Perhaps you should explain what you think science has its basis
in values means The reason why people DO science is that
they value its results That does not mean that science has
its basis in values Any more than DES stops working if I stop
valuing my privacy

So you better explain what objective atoms are and how we get them
from subjective values before we go any further
See above
