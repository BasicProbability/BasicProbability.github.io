 The truth is is that it is not some sort of magic spell  The truth
 is is that you do not understand it and enjoy not understanding it

Im curious about this statement is it a known understanding amongst
Christian believers that people who dont understand the Christian
doctrines are enjoying this state I come from a background with 
a heavy Christian teaching Lutheran church and consider myself
knowledgeable with the basic understandings of Christianity At the 
same time Im not proud of things I dont understand or know of at
this point of time Ignorance is not bliss

Cheers
