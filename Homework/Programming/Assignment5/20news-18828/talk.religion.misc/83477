 I will repeat my position here  Worshipping on Sunday has never been a
 sin  As a child I attended services on Saturday and Sundayat the SDA
 church and at the Pentecostal church across the street  I might even go to a
 Baptist church next week  I worship God every day and every Christian 
 should  Even if we can prove that Christians should meet on Sunday and
 we cant we can never prove that violation of the Sabbath is not a sin
 any longer  Nor can we prove that violation of Sunday is a sin  We
 cannot use the Sabbath commandment for that purpose

My online Bible is on a CD but I dont own a CDROM system for the
time being so I cant search for the famous cite where Jesus explicitly
states that he didnt want to break existing Jewish laws In other
words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday
as their holy day if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus

Cheers
Kent
