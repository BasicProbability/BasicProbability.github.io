Subject Rosicrucian Orders 


Kent

     You say that

There are about 410 competing Rosicrucian orders existing today
                      
most of them are spinoffs from OTO and other competing organizations
from the 19th century FranceGermany Maybe I should write an article
                        Please dont  
about all this I spent some time investigating these organizations
and their conceptual world view systems

     Name just three really competing Rosicrucian Orders I have
probably spent more time than you doing the same 

     None of them are spinoffs from OTO The opposite may be the
case 

Study Harder
