How does one falsify any origin theory For example are a forever existing
universe or abiogenesis strictly falsifiable

The same way that any theory is proven false  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes and try to observe them  If you dont or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldnt happen then you have some 
evidence against the theory  If the theory cant be modified to 
incorporate the new observations then you say that it is false

For example people used to believe that the earth had been created
10000 years ago  But as evidence showed that predictions from this 
theory were not true it was abandoned
