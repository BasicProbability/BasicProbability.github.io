  If there is a Western ethic against infanticide why
  are so many children dying all over the world
 
 The majority of the world isnt Western

Superficially a good answer but it isnt that simple  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner  For instance some thirdworld countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce  so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US to make tender juicy steaks and burgers  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out  Fundraising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea instead we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny theyve got

Perhaps its more accurate to say that theres a Western ethic against
Western infanticide  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World we couldnt give a shit  And that goes for the
supposed ProLife movement too  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion  Hell if theyre only interested in fetuses they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China

And besides Suzannes answer implies that nonWestern countries lack this
ethic against infanticide  Apart from China with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet I dont believe this to be the case
