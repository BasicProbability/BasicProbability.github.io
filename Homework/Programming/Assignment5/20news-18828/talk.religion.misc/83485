 And here children we have a person playing the objective morality doesnt 
 exist show me one game  You can play this with just about anything
 
 And this objective medicine is
 And this objective physics is
 And this objective reality is

Precisely

Theres no objective medicine some people get marvellous results from
alternative therapy others only respond to traditional medicine

Theres no objective physics Einstein and Bohr have told us that

Theres no objective reality  LSD should be sufficient to prove that

 One wonders just what people who ask such questions understand by the term 
 objective if anything

I consider it to be a useful fiction an abstract ideal we can strive
towards  Like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string it doesnt
actually exist but we can talk about things as if they were like it and not
be too far wrong
