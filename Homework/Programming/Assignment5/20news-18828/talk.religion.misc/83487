Subject Re After 2000 years can we say that Christian Morality is

 I am not a Christian however I suspect that all flavours of 
 Christianity hold that a objective morality exists and b their
 particular interpretation of scripturerevelationTV is a goodly glimpse
 of it  That they may all disagree about b says nothing about the truth 
 or falsehood of a

Actually they generally claim that b their particular interpretation of
scripturerevelation is this objective morality  That there are two
conflicting versions of this objective morality does tell us something about
a  It tells us at least one fake objective morality exists

The next logical step is to deduce that any given religions objective
morality could be the fake one  So caveat emptor
