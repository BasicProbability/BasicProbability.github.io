 This brings up another question I still have to ponder  why is there so 
 much antiSemitism  Why do people hate Jews  I dont hate Jews  I consider
 them to be like anyone else sinners we all are
I dont know I dont care about ethnical rights and wrongs myself
but its evident that Christians consider Jews no longer to be the 
sole selected group of Gods people  while Jews consider this to
be the case

Christian antiSemitism comes from the obvious fact that the Jews should
know the Hebrew Scriptures better than anyone else yet they did not
convert to Christianity en mass thus rejecting Christian Love

No wonder this caused antiSemitism One might even
wonder that if Christianity didnt do this separation would antiSemitism
have even started

I dont see why not Where are the rest of the tribal people What
happened to the tribes of the Americas Culture is seen as different and
undesirable in the West particular in the US with its failed melting
pot concept Most tribes have been hunted to extinction the Hebrew
tribe is one of the few survivers from the Neolithic Of course it
becomes difficult at times to separate Christianity from the Western
experience so perhaps you are right perhaps it would have been a better 
world if the cultural experiment in Christianity never happened
