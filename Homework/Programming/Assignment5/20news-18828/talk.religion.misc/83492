Rhoemer was the name of the guy responsible for much of the uniforms 
and props used by the early Nazis in their rallies and such

The name is Roehm not Rhoemer  And Hitler does claim that he came up
with the Swastika business

But didnt he credit the actual flag design to a party member  some dentist or
other I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf

He was killed in an early Nazi purge He and many of his associates
were flaming homosexuals well know also for their flamboyant orgies

I have been trying to find if there is any actual evidence for this
common assertion recently  Postings to such groups as sochistory and
socculturegerman has not uncovered any netexperts who could provide
any 

Well Im no expert but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before the night of the
long knives The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge Also a book by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment called Homosexuals in History asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals as well as others in Roehms SA circle

Rest deleted  Can anybody out in aph help out

Find out about the night of the brown shirts
