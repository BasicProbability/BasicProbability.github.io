Before I repond to 2 Andy please clarify 1  You state that
proteins did not form randomly  That seems to be my point  

Well I am not Andy but if you had familiarized yourself with some of
the current theorieshypotheses about abiogenesis before posting  you
would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were
assembled randomly from amino acids It is current thinking that RNA
based replicators came before proteinaceous enzymes and that proteins
were assembled by some kind of primitive translation machinery
