     Name just three really competing Rosicrucian Orders I have
probably spent more time than you doing the same 

     None of them are spinoffs from OTO The opposite may be the
case 

Can we assume from this statement that you are unequivocally saying that
AMORC is not a spin off of OTO  and that in fact OTO may well be a spin
off of AMORC
i would be quite interested in hearing what evidence you have to support this
claim
