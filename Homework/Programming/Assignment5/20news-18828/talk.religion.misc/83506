Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law Honestly
The word of Sin is Restriction Would I kid you


Does one mans words encompass the majestic vision of thousands
of individuals  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
Order  Taken out of context words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression

I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta Frater Superior 
of the Order to which I belong  When he included that bit
from Merlinus X he did us all a service  He showed us the extremes
to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor
I have little knowledge regarding Reuss background but surely
he was an unusual man and he was an important force in the Order 
for many years

Yet as people change so do Orders change and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of OTO remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual  I hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order
itself perhaps by testing the limits myself


Let us examine this issue a bit more closely

In 1895 Karl Kellner 18501905 a wealthy Austrian industrialist
and paper chemist as well as a highgrade Mason founded the Ordo
Templi Orientis  Kellner had traveled widely in the East where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices  
Kellners efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz
Hartmann Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss who had worked together
prior to joining the OTO  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902
in Reusss Masonic publication Oriflamme  On Kellners death
Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head OHO  The Jubilee edition of
the Oriflamme published in 1912 announced that the Order taught
secret of sexual magic
 
Theodore Reuss was an interesting character  Born June 28 1855 in
Augsburg he entered Masonry in 1876  He was a singer journalist and
possibly a spy for the Prussian political police infiltrating the Socialist
League founded by Karl Marxs daughter and her husband  Reuss was
later associated with William Wynn Westcott a leader of the Golden
Dawn who later introduced him to John Yarker  Yarker chartered Reuss to
found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany  After several
attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites Reuss settled on the
development of the OTO

The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss leadership
For example he chartered Papus in France Rudolph Steiner in Berlin
and H Spencer Lewis in the USA  In 1912 the historic meeting between
Reuss and Crowley occurred  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing Order secrets  When Crowley looked at it afresh
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all
the English speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the Equinox

Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a
stroke and named Crowley his successor  All was well until 1925 when
The Book of the Law was translated into German  There was a break
in the continuity of the Order  Manyk members split with the new OHO
over the book which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order
He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reusss request deeply
infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation

An Introduction to the History of the OTO by Ad Veritatem IX

Within Equinox III10 Edited by 
  Hymenaeus Beta Frater Superior Rex Summus Sanctissimus
    Caliph of the United States of America
      Published by Samuel Weiser 1990



There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this
material in Equinox III10  And this is the real point is it not
Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of Thelema  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers  A picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations

It is quite easy for me to see for example that all of OTO derived
out of the dribble of faltering Masonry purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them  And I
can take that all the way down to our present Caliph whose feeble
support of the Law of Thelema is laughable at best

Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way  
Will I  
I think not
Why  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective an interjection
I am using as an example  My illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first

So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X  Please look OTO more carefully
I do not support Reusss words myself as I am not qualified to assess
them and I am critical of their pomposity  If I who am a member of
the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then
what can this say about the health of the Order  Does it mean that
the Order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles  Or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement  How shall we resolve these two possibilities


I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis
They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information  They are quite often artists and geniuses  
Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area many who are or
were very heavily involved with the Order I can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands

I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta  In these moments 
I followed my intuition and Ive found little to stop me from requesting
a Second initiation from a different OTO body  Im happily participating
in social groups Feasts or Initiations and have come to know the Gnostic
Mass well enough for my tastes
 

This doesnt make me an authority on Order politics and explanations however
I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my
limited contact with other members

I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far  There are many
ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with
the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision

I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread


Invoke me under my stars  Love is the law love under will

I am I
