 Do you mean its moral to use force on someone who advocates
 the use of force
 
 With a few provisos yes  Minimum force for a start And it
 depends on what is being forced on either side   
 
 Or do you mean that sometimes we have to use force on such
 people out of necessity or selfdefence while recognizing
 that our own actions in doing so are not moral
 
 My opinion is that our actions would be moral and it would be
 immoral not to act if action would be both necessary and effective  
 Again there many caveats and provisios
 
 Note my usage of my opinion is an admission that I dont have a lock
 on morals not that there is no truth about morality to have a lock on

Youre admitting a lot more than that  You are admitting that
your morals are situational   You are admitting that the actions
of other people and the situation you are in help to determine
how you judge the moral significance of one of your own actions

If you employ X degree of force thats not moral but if you employ
X degree of force but previously someone else has employed Y degree
of force and the situation is thusandso that is moral

This is quite different from saying Employing force on other people
is immoral period   Unfortunately from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of selfpreservation and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that

For what its worth  and yes I know you claim to be an agnostic 
its this ability to relabel things from immoral to moral 
that I find one of the least attractive qualities of the religious
mind
