  	You have only pushed back the undefined meaning You must now define 
  what objective values are
  
  Really  You dont know what objective value is  If I offered the people
  of the US collectively 1 for all of the land in America would that 
  sound like a good deal  
 
 You mean that if you can find a ridiculous price the rest of
 us are supposed to conclude that an objectively correct price
 exists
 
 I said nothing about the price  I asked if the deal was good  It isnt

So it was a complete nonsequitur is that it     How does coming
up with a derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of
objective values

Youre asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned
down and we believe that not because we appeal to objective values
but becasue we know or think we know something about people

All the people we know exhibit subjective values that would lead
them to reject a deal of 1 for all of the land in America

Great   Now so what
