      Name just three really competing Rosicrucian Orders I have
 probably spent more time than you doing the same 
 
      None of them are spinoffs from OTO The opposite may be the
 case 
 
 Can we assume from this statement that you are unequivocally saying that
 AMORC is not a spin off of OTO  and that in fact OTO may well be a spin
 off of AMORC
 i would be quite interested in hearing what evidence you have to support this
 claim 
 
 

Well there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
that OTO has been around since at least the late 1800s long before
Crowley ever heard of it how long has AMORC been around yes I know
that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory
but I doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
as a nonprofit that can be carbondated to 20000 BC
