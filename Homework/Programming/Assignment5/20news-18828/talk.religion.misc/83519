In a previous article alamutnetcomcom Max Delysid y says


Can we assume from this statement that you are unequivocally saying that
AMORC is not a spin off of OTO 

Absolutely Lewis didnt care for the 1921 OTO charter from Reuss He had
in mind something completely diferent Crowley and Lewis were very
different persons as you probably know

 and that in fact OTO may well be a spin
off of AMORC

No My overstatement sorry
