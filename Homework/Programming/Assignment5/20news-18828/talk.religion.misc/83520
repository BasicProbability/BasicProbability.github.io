Subject Re Rosicrucian Orders 


ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are let me point out the
Golden Dawn is only the outer order of that tradition  The inner order is
the Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis  Thats Ruby Rose and Gold Cross in rough
translation  The GD is a Rosicrucian order as are all derivative
groups  Of course real Rosicrucians never admit to being Rosicrucian

Enjoy the journey
