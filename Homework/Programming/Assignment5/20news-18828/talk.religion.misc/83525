 However one highly biased account as well as possibly internally 
 inconsistent written over 2 mellenia ago in a dead language by fanatic
 devotees of the creature in question which is not supported by other more 
 objective sources and isnt  even accepted by those whos messiah this creature 
 was supposed to be doesnt convince me in the slightest especially when many
 of the current day devotees appear brainwashed into believing this pile of 
 guano

       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you dont want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  
 
Bill I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who in the course of his or her research is willing to let the
chips fall where they may  This excludes literalists who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists  They find what they want to find  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others
 
Why an insert  Read it  I have a number of times  The passage is glaringly
out of context and Josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work  The passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears

I think this is a weak argument  The fact is there are two references to
Jesus in Antiquities of the Jews one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians  Origen wrote in the third century that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah while the long passage
says the opposite  There is an Arabic manuscript of Antiquities of the
Jews which contains a version of the passage which is much less gungho
for Jesus and may be authentic
   There is no question that Origen in the third century saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus  There are no manuscripts of Antiquities which
lack the references

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted but
I dont think its very likelynor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case I know GA Wells takes
this position but thats because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed  And he is a professor of German not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus
