In a previous article bamrcnextcsouiucedu BA DavisHowe says


ON the subject of how many competing RC orders there are let me point out the
Golden Dawn is only the outer order of that tradition  The inner order is
the Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis  


	Just wondering do you mean the Lectorium Rosicrucianum
Warning There is no point in arguing whos legit and whos not WHICH
Golden Dawn are you talking about

No I dont mean the LR whatever that is  As for which GD Im using The
Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic as my source so unless Regardie is
lying Im pulling the name out the the original orders rituals  The
multiple modern groups are part of why I through in the comment about all
the spinoffs

	Just for the sake of argument reflecting NO affiliation
I am going to say that the TRUE Rosicrucian Order is the Fraternitas
Rosae Crucis in Quakertown Penn

As a member of the Religious Society of Friends my membership is in the
UrbanaChampaign IL Friends Meeting I find that amusingly ironic 

	Any takers 

Not meI dont want to belong to anything which runs around claiming to
be the TRUE whatever  I find that disgusting 

Enjoy the journey
