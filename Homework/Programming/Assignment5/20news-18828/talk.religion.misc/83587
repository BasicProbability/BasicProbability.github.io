If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a good thing
then I would be very glad to hear it and you might even convert me
Be warned however that Ive heard all the most common arguments
before and they just dont convince me

Be warned it is not my job to convert you  That is the job of
the Holy Spirit  And I frankly make a lousy one  I am only
here to testify  Your conversion is between you and God  I am
out of the loop  If you decide to follow Jesus of which I
indeed would be estatic then all the glory be to God
