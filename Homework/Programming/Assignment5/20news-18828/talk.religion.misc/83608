 Jesus gives more reasons in John 167  But one obvious reason
 why Jesus died and as with everything else it has nothing do with
 his punishment was that he could rise to life againso that
 we would stop doubting and believe John 2127  The fact
 that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
 from the dead  It is an obvious point  Do not overlook it
 Without this obvious point I would have no hope
 and my faith would be vanity

Glad to hear this just a note Osiris Mithras and many other
cult gods resurrected as well so theres a good chance for all of
us to maybe end up in a virtual reality simulator and live forever
hurrah

Sorry this was a joke some sort of one anyway Im the first
that connected Osiris with a virtual reality personality database
Time to write a book


Cheers
Kent
