In article 1qknu0INNbhvshelleyuwashingtonedu  Christian  washed in
the blood of the lamb
 Mithraist  washed in the blood of the bull
 
 If anyone in netland is in the process of devising a new religion
 do not use the lamb or the bull because they have already been
 reserved  Please choose another animal preferably one not
 on the Endangered Species List  

This will be a hard task because most cultures used most animals
for blood sacrifices It has to be something related to our current
postmodernism state Hmm what about used computers

Cheers
Kent
