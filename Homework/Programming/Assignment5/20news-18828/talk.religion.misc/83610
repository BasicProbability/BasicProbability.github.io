 These laws written for the Israelites Gods chosen people whom God had
 expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
 direct witness to Gods existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
 is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
 Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
 Gods chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
 age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
 repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
 for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
 alike

Jews wont agree with you Malcolm
