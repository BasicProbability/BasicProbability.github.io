 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature O Arjuna become transcendental to these three modes Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety and be
established in the self
  
                                PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature They are meant for fruitive results which
cause bondage in the material world The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane Arjuna
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where in the
beginning there is brahmajijnasa or questions on the supreme
transcendence All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence For them the Lord after creation of
the material world gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement When the activities for sense
gratification namely the karmakanda chapter are finished then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads which are part of different Vedas as the Bhagavadgita is a
part of the fifth Veda namely the Mahabharata The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life

 As long as the material body exists there are actions and reactions in
the material modes One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress or cold and warmth and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna
