Subject Re Rosicrucian Orders 


In a previous article cdcolvinrahulnet Christopher D Colvin says

I guess the San Jose Mercury news is wrong then 
				      

	No It is old You said AMORC IS not was 
Nothing personal OK Good 

	Maybe you didnt know that its over by now There is no more
pending legal actions from no where period So yes there was a
situation and it has been resolved by BOTH parties As long as humans 
handle anything it is subjected to breaking 

	BTW Gary L Stewart has a PO Box in TX calling his org ARC
Ancient Rosae Crucis I guess he couldnt take the MO from AMORC
