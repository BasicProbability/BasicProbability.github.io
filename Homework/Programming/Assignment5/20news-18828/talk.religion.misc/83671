Subject Re Davidians and compassion

Is there evidence independent of the FBI that indicates that the Branch
Davidians set the fire  What have the survivors said  Did the press see
anything

There is unfortunately precedent for the US government saving children by
roasting them alive  There is precedent for religious selfimolation
as well

I still wonder why the government couldnt just leave them alone
