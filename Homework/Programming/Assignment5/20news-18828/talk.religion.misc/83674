 Can you please point to something anything that proves to me that
 the universe cannot possibly be explained without accepting as a fact
 the existence of a god in precisely the way your holy book describes
 
 Can you please convince me that your religion is more than a very
 cleverlyconstructed fable and that it does indeed have some bearing
 on my own personal daytoday life

Would you consider the word of an eyewitness Peter to testify to the
events surrounding Jesus life

No  There are two problems here

1 Peter died two millenia ago  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust  If he were alive today and I could
question him then this might lend credibility to your claims but
probably not much because after all Ive heard people claim with all
sincerity that theyve spoken with Elvis recently  But after his
death Peters writings were transcribed by monks for centuries and I
find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didnt decide to
change the wording of something to make it in his opinion a little
easier to understand

2 Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago
that doesnt mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is God
might just be Satan trying to convince everyone that hes a nice
guy or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today

Nice try but it just isnt enough to convince me especially since
your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way
Ive observed the world to work  Please find something more compelling

    The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre
     is that it ends                                            Rousseau
