Consider your mother Merlyn  You know your mother  What would you think
of me if I asserted that your mother is 9 feet tall murdered your father
and sexually abused you when you were a kid

I would just go fetch my parents and show them to you and thereby
prove quite definitively that my mother is not named Merlyn she is
not nine feet tall and my father is quite alive

Then I would assert quite simply that your deity does not exist and
wait for a similar demonstration from you
