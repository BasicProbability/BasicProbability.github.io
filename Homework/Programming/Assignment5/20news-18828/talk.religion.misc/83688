In a previous article cdcolvinrahulnet Christopher D Colvin says

I worked at AMORC when I was in HS

OK So you were a naive teen

He HS Lewis dates back to the 20s 

Wrong 1915 and if you do your homework 1909
But he was born LAST century 1883


Right now AMORC is embroiled in some internal political turmoil 

No it isnt 



I guess the San Jose Mercury news is wrong then and if so why is the DA 
involved
