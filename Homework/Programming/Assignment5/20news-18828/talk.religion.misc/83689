Subject Re New newsgroup socreligionislamahmadiyya


Mr Esam AbdelRahem writes

I urge you all to vote NO to the formation of the news group AHMADYAISLAM
If they want to have their own group the word ISLAM shouldnot be attached to 
the name of such group We dont consider them as Muslims


Dr Tahir Ijaz comments on Esam AbdelRahems statement

But the problem is We consider ourself to be Muslims even though you dont
Luckily faith is determined by what one believes and is a personal matter
You cannot declare the faith of someone else


Mr Jawad Ali then comments on Tahir Ijazs statement

You are not considering the consequences of your argument  The converse
would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider Ahmadies to be
Muslims  Who one considers to be ones cobeliever is also a personal
matter  It would be just as wrong to tell the Muslims who should be
included in their selfdefination


The argument by Jawad Ali is funny He writes
The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims

Which is a wrong statement In the light of Dr Ijazs statement the
above statement should be corrected
is that some nonAhmadi Muslims
dont consider AhmadiMuslims as Muslims

So the problem does not get solved Who is a muslims and who is not
Humans cannot decide Humans may not declare others faiths Its that 
simple I dont understand why the mere use of the word ISLAM is
becomming such a big issue I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject and all they say No NO you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup  

I havent seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of others faiths Who gives them this authority Quran or
Hadith or something else I want to know this 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers Did EVER the 
Holy Prophet of Islam Muhammad PBUH say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim

No You are not a Muslim  

NEVER I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam

Hence if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone how
could the Muslims Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad PBUH  


Sincerely
Nabeel
