Be warned it is not my job to convert you  That is the job of
the Holy Spirit  And I frankly make a lousy one  I am only
here to testify  Your conversion is between you and God  I am
out of the loop  If you decide to follow Jesus of which I
indeed would be estatic then all the glory be to God

Ive asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me  I
really wish I could believe in him cos no matter how much confidence
I build up on my own the universe is a big place and it would be
so nice to know I have someone watching over me in it

Ive gone into this with an open mind  Ive layed my beliefs aside
from time to time when Ive had doubt and Ive prayed to see what
good that would do  I dont see what more I can do to open myself to
your god short of just deciding to believe for no good reason  And
if I decide to believe for no good reason why not believe in some
other god  Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate

All I know is that in all my searching even though Ive set aside my
pride and decided that I want to know the truth no matter how
difficult it may be to accept I have never had any encounter with any
deity Christian or otherwise

Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself
