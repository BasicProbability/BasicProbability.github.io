  Now that Big Brother has rubbed out one minority religion in Waco who is
  next  The Mormons or Jews
 
 Give me a break  If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth
 and were involved in illegal activity then they deserve whatever they get
 

Where were you brought up  In the former USSR  Is Innocent until proven  
guilty by a jury of your peers NOT Dan Rather dead in this country  Seems  
so  Is tax evasion the only charge brought against the BDs punishable by  
death in this country now


 You are making a ludicrous suggestion
 
Not really  You are a blind idiot

  We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of
  their rights to worship and bear arms  Now we dont
 
 Does that include the right to murder little children  How about killing
 ATF officers  I do not know much about the gun laws in Texas but 
 Koreshs folks claimed to have grenades grenade launchers and rocket
 launchers  I am not sure that the NRA feels that this falls under 
 right to bear arms

Not sure yet you condem them to death for it  If the BATF had stayed home

  Of course to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record  It has
  happened before
 
 Please explain  I do not remember Jews or Mormons as a group overtly 
 breaking a judicious aka nonNazi law and being punished for it
  
You have a short memory

  Ill bet all you cult haters are happy now right  Just hope youre not  
next
