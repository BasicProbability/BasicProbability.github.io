Subject cults who keeps them going 


Mr Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco
should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so
Now I began scratching my head thinking a bad sign  dont the 
mainstream religions in this case Christianityor the 7th day 
adventist in particular just keep these guys going  Isnt Mr Clinton 
condemning his own religion  After all isnt it a cult too 

 bad thoughts these
