Subject Re Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention

In article 1qv82loj2usenetINSCWRUEdu ch981clevelandFreenetEdu Tony Alicea writes
     With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider
the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity I thought
the following quotes by Mr James Holly the AntiMasonic Flag Carrier
would amuse you all
MUNCH
     I hope you all had a good laugh I know I did g

It would be funny if it wasnt so damn NASTY and as nonxian as I am 
its hard to believe that someone is pushing black is white and freedom
is slavery so blatantly
