Sorry the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called AMORC 
I dont remember for the time being what the AM stand for
but ORC is Ordo Rosae Crucis in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross 


Response

Yes very true  The entire title is The Ancient and Mystical Order
 Rosae Crucis  They are located at 1342 Naglee Avenue San Jose
California 951910001 USA

They are considered different and largely unrelated by a number of
sources  Ive seen documentation which links them through the figure
of H Spencer Lewis  Lewis was apparently involved with Reuss who
was the OHO of Ordo Templi Orientis for many years  Apparently it
is also true that Lewis had a charter to form an OTO body and then
created AMORC as a subsidiary  an interesting question

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore if any of you are interested in such books
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum


Response

Indeed and diagonally across the street is another metaphysical
book store called Ram Metaphysical wherein Ive purchased some
wonderful works by Crowley and others  Ram Metaphysical Books
