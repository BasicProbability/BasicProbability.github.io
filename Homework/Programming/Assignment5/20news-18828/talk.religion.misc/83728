Mr Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco
should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so
Now I began scratching my head thinking a bad sign  dont the 
mainstream religions in this case Christianityor the 7th day 
adventist in particular just keep these guys going  Isnt Mr Clinton 
condemning his own religion  After all isnt it a cult too 


A good point  What helps to keep such things going is the public
attitude that one should have faith that some authority from
on high should not be subjected to mere reason  Couple this with a
variety of personality quirks mojor and minor mental illnesses and
ego of wouldbe leaders and you get all the variety of cults and 
religions that people subscribe to
