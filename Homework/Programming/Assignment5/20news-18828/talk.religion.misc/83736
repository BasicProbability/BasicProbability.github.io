I had said

 Merlyn you missed the point too  Christianity is a relationship  I have
 a relationship with my God  I know Him  

 Consider your mother Merlyn  You know your mother  What would you think
 of me if I asserted that your mother is 9 feet tall murdered your father
 and sexually abused you when you were a kid   Would you who knows your
 mother well think was a blind arrogant idiot to proclaim such things

Merlyn LeRoy says
 
This analogy is not good for example there are plenty of people who
know god as well as you do but dont agree on things like

1 how many children heshe has
2 whether heshe approves of polygamy
3 whether Mohammed was one of hisher prophets

Now if you AND all these other people who ABSOLUTELY KNOW what god is
like cant agree on basic attributes like these at least one of you
who knows what this godthing is like must be wrong therefore
subjective certainty is worthless regarding knowledge of this god

On the other hand I dont know any large groups of people who claim
absolute knowledge of my mother and who disagree about her basic
attributes  This is the difference between real people and imaginary friends

Meryln therefore by your logic since your people disagree about
the characteristics of your mother you mother must be imaginary
