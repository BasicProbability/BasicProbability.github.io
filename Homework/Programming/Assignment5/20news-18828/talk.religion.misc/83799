Subject Re Spreading Christianity Re Christian Extremist Kills Doctor

I addressed most of the key issues in this very long 284 lines post
by Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday  The first was made into the
title post of a new thread Is Dean Kaflowitz terminally ironyimpaired
and the second more serious one appeared along the thread

A Chaney Post and a Challenge reissued and revised

both only in talkabortion but I am posting its contents into
talkreligionmisc as soon as I exit here

This should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so  The
second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us
The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as 
KaflowitzDebatingPoints tm which he continues to rack up on both
talkabortion and talkreligionmisc while setting followups to 
talkabortion alone  His lame excuse for the latter policy is that
he gets a prompt as to where to set followups and does not follow
talkreligionmisc much this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not
also setting his Newsgroups line to talkabortion alone
