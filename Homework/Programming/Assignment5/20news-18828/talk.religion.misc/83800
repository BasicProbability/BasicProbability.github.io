Most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which I am following up are
dealt with in the following post I made on talkabortion yesterday
modified to correct the next to last paragraph

  perhaps out
 of dedication to your convictions I never never thought that you
 would be consciously intellectually dishonest though
 
 I am not  Can you show me anything that would lead you to think 
 otherwise

See the Spreading Christianity thread in which he says I
ignore certain statements that I specifically acknowledged and

Dean did not  He called them the Great Commission but this is NOT
descriptive of Jesuss words in Matt 1015

Matt 1014 Jerusalem Bible translation

	And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
	to say as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust
	from your feet

Matt 1015

 	I tell you solemnly on the day of Judgment it will not 
 	go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with 
 	that town

In the post to which Dean is referring above I said

 The above is a good description of Kaflowitz who keeps harping on
  shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next
                                   

The highlighted words refer to Matt 1014 and 1015 respectively

And Dean countered

Actually this comment of yours is a perfect example of what an
intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are since I
specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty
to spread the word  In fact it is the combination of the two
statements I was addressing and not just the one and for you to
characterize that as ignoring the instruction to spread the
word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are

Of course Matt 1015 quoted above makes no mention of instruction
to spread the word

All these quotes btw are from

in which at the end he claims I did not answer a question
which I answered and which he deleted to get the chronology
right he deleted the answer and then said I didnt answer

And I claim it correctly because my question went

Do you too measure
the goodness of a post by its entertainment value and care not
a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood

and the closest Dean came to an answer was

Peter Peter Peter  Youre just so stupid pretentious dull
and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
the sport is all there is

Of course this does NOT answer my question which has to do with posts
in GENERAL and not my posts in particular  Surely even Dean knows this
yet he brazenly asserts otherwise reinforcing his claim with an insult

So I now restore the answer to your question
that you deleted  If youre still unable to figure it out ask
a nice kid at the local junior high to help you  It really
doesnt take much sophistication to understand

On top of which I doubt that the answer is at all representative
of Deans true frame of mind  The insults you have seen quoted thus
far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Deans 
mind throughout the 284line post from which these quotes were taken
One wonders whether Deans mind is so warped as to find sport in all
this

He even dredges up a falsified account of
events that transpired earlier on another thread

You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
				
was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of

the sins of other individuals


False  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for ones sins
That I made public announcements of the sins of others
sins BTW that were a matter of public record documented in
the posts of others is a different matter

Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins so
I pointed some of them out  And I expressly set up a whole thread
YOUR TURN to let people point out MY sins to me

Dean again

You made an ass of yourself
by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
somehow an attempt to paint Jews as plaster saints thereby
revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about Jews and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made and then
claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge

Actually what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew
who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
according to Jewish customs  In doing so he was caricaturing
Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding as well as
implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity

I went very easily on Dean for this giving him the benefit of
the doubt in a post following my initial crack about plaster saints 
suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording

In an astonishing act of ingratitude Dean now serves up an incredibly
distorted picture of what took place between us and using it as
the basis of one insult after another
