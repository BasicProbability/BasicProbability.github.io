	You say that

   There are about 410 competing Rosicrucian orders existing today
			  
   most of them are spinoffs from OTO and other competing organizations
   from the 19th century FranceGermany Maybe I should write an article
			    Please dont  

huh it might be interesting he is relating the story as I have heard
it btw

   about all this I spent some time investigating these organizations
   and their conceptual world view systems

	Name just three really competing Rosicrucian Orders I have
   probably spent more time than you doing the same 

	None of them are spinoffs from OTO The opposite may be the
   case 

huh care to back that up
