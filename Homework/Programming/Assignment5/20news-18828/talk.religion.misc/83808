So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
on their house killing most of the people inside

We have no way to know that the cultists burned the house it could have been
the BATF and FBI  We only have the governments word for it after all and
people who started it by a noknock search with concussion grenades are hardly
disinterested observers

	Nor to point out the obvious are the deluded siegementality
followers of a religious nutcase who thought he was Jesus Christ or possibly
The Big Guy
	Personally much as I regard the BATF and FBI as ConDupes Ill take
their word over a bunch of silly pinks who were stoopid enough to lock
themselves up with a goofball like David Koresh in a makeshift arsenal
