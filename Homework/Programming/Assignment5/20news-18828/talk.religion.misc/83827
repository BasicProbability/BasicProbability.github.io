Subject Re Question on Sabbath question Correction

 There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to
 worship on the Sabbath Saturday  The bestknown are the SeventhDay
 Adventists and Jehovahs Witnesses  They argue that Act 207 is not a
 regular worship service but a special meeting to see Paul off and
 that I Cor 162 doesnt explicitly say its a regular worship service

Jehovahs Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe
the Sabbath whether it is on Saturday or Sunday  The Sabbath was part
of a Covenent between God and the Israelites and is not required for
Christians
