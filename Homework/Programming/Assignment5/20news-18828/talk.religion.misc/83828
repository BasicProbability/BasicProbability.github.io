 My thoughts my posts my ideas my responsibility my beer my pizza  OK
 Do you have some pumps and a purse in this shade  A perfume that whispers 
 please come back to me  Im looking for something in GreenLaurie Morgan

Sorry but it doesnt matter what you think I am a Christian who happens to
belong to the LDS Church  The Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints

I dont usually read trm  It is truly informative to stop by and see that there
are still people in the world like those that forced my ancestors into the deserts
of Utah and then out of the country entirely  My grandmother was born in Mexico
where her family had moved to escape religious persecution in the US  Im willing
to admit that members of other churches are Christians if they believe in Christ and
try to follow his teachings even though they have different interpretations of 
the bible  And yet these other churches often go out of their way to define whether
or not I am considered to be Christian  Could someone mail me a set of rulesbeliefs
that must be followed to be a Christian  Does this set of rules exclude other large
bodies of believers  

I know this is a waste of everyones time this has probably been discussed N times
etc  I guess Im more sensitive to this demonization after what went on in Texas
