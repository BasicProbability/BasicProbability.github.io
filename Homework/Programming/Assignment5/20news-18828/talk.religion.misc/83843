 So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
 on their house killing most of the people inside
 
 We have no way to know that the cultists burned the house it could have been
 the BATF and FBI  We only have the governments word for it after all and
 people who started it by a noknock search with concussion grenades are hardly
 disinterested observers

Well looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various
places at the same time which would indicate that this was a planned
action Im sure FBI and BATF didnt deliberately start a possible
fire having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier 
method Looking at the careful operation and use of tear gas
that as I know dont start fires it is less likely that this 
was the case

Sorry but my bets are on fanatical people keen to start
Armageddon  theirs

Cheers
Kent
