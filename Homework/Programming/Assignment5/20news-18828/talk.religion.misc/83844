 So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
 on their house killing most of the people inside
 
 We have no way to know that the cultists burned the house it could have been
 the BATF and FBI  We only have the governments word for it after all and
 people who started it by a noknock search with concussion grenades are hardly
 disinterested observers

Theres another point to be made Those who have been inside burning
houses know that if they want to stay alive its better to run out
from the building We had one case where an FBI agent had to 
drag out a women from the burning house she run back in when
she saw the forces arriving It is a good indication of the fanatical
mind that the followers had  including having they children burned
instead of saving these innocent victims of the instance

Cheers
