 Such as who hurts more  the ones who died or the loved ones who 
 are left Besides the lessons Its also time for many to grieve
 Including those whove lost their faith in others or in God
 
 Im learning to be patient and let things heal God willing

Christians through ages have had to learn to be patient I do think
its time to face the reality The events during the last 52 two
days showed what the world is really like
