 They are considered different and largely unrelated by a number of
 sources  Ive seen documentation which links them through the figure
 of H Spencer Lewis  Lewis was apparently involved with Reuss who
 was the OHO of Ordo Templi Orientis for many years  Apparently it
 is also true that Lewis had a charter to form an OTO body and then
 created AMORC as a subsidiary  an interesting question

If anyone is interested in the history of AMORC I do think Spencer
Lewis published books about the beginning and his mission The 
Alexandria bookstore thats the name of the book store operated 
by AMORC should have a selection that should provide the interested
reader more insight 

Cheers
