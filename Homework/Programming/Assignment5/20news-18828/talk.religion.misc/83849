 question is On what authority do we proclaim that the requirements of the
               
 fourth commandment are no longer relevant to modern Christians  Please
 
I dont believe most Christians believe they are above the Law  However
we are not saved by adherence to the Law  The Law exists to tell us what
is sinful  We all sin

Hence we are all above the Law where all in this case refers to
Christians

Jews believe that their sins are atoned for with
blood sacrifice of animals as described in the Old Testament

When was the last time you heard about a Jewish animal sacrifice

Christians 
believe that their sins are atoned for by the blood sacrifice of Jesus

The blood sacrifice of an innocent man

This does not make the Law irrelevant

Then why dont Christians follow it why dont they even follow their
own Ten Commandments

Breaking the Law is sinful
and we are to avoid sinful ways but sinning by itself does not jeopardize
salvation

So in short Hitler is in heaven and Gandhi is in Hell

Note that Im not a theologian  But this is the gist of several
sermons Ive heard lately and some Bible studies Ive been through  

Did you ever wonder if someone perhaps a great deceiver was pulling
your leg
