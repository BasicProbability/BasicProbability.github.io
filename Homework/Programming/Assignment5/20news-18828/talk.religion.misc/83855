From sandviknewtonapplecom Kent Sandvik
Subject Davidians and compassion

So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire
on their house killing most of the people inside

Im not that annoyed about the adults they knew supposedly what
they were doing and its their own actions

What I mostly are angry about is the fact that the people inside
including mothers let the children suffer and die during awful
conditions

If this is considered religious following to the end Im proud
that I dont follow such fanatical and noncompassionate religions

You might want to die for whatever purpose but please spare
the innocent young ones that has nothing to do with this all

I have a hard time just now understanding that Christianity
knows about the word compassion Christians do you think 
the actions today would produce a good picture of your 
religion
