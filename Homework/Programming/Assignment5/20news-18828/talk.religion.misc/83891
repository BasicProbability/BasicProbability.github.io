I am surprised and saddened I would expect this kind of behavior
from the Evangelical BornAgain GospelThumping InYourFace Were
TheOnlyTrueChristian Protestants but I have always thought 
that Catholics behaved better than this
                                   Please do not stoop to the
level of the E BA GT IYF WTOTC Protestants who think
that the best way to witness is to be strident intrusive loud
insulting and overbearingly selfrighteous

Please  Im begging you  Quit confusing religious groups and stop
making generalizations  Im a Protestant  Im an evangelical  I dont
believe that my way is the only way  Im not a creation scientist  I
dont think that homosexuals should be hung by their toenails  

If you want to discuss bible thumpers you would be better off singling
out and making obtuse generalizations about Fundamentalists  If you
compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
Baptists you would think that they were different religions

Please prejudice is about thinking that all people of a group are the
same so please dont write off all Protestants or all evangelicals

GodI wish I could get ahold of all the Thomas Stories
