 These laws written for the Israelites

 Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied
 only to Gods chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We
 are living in the age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable
 by death  There is repentance and there is salvation through our
 Lord Jesus Christ  And not just for a few chosen people  Salvation
 is available to everyone Jew and Gentile alike 

Jews wont agree with you Malcolm

Which Jews KS 

ex as a people as a language religiously politically or 

Do you mean those Jews who are Gods chosen

And Malcolm please if you will set your word wrap at 75 or less 
to avoid clutter
