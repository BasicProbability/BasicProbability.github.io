  These laws written for the Israelites Gods chosen people whom God had
  expressly set apart from the rest of the world  The Israelites were a
  direct witness to Gods existence  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
  is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable
  Remember these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
  Gods chosen people  But Jesus has changed all of that  We are living in the
  age of grace  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death  There is
  repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ  And not just
  for a few chosen people  Salvation is available to everyone Jew and Gentile
  alike
 
 Jews wont agree with you Malcolm

A lot of people wont agree with me  Thats their right and I respect that
However to the point Jews are also covered by the saving grace of Jesus
Christ  There are Jews who have become Christians

This brings up another question I still have to ponder  why is there so 
much antiSemitism  Why do people hate Jews  I dont hate Jews  I consider
them to be like anyone else sinners we all are
