 Here tis  Someone just told me that the Old Testament books were translated
 into Greek a long time ago
   Yes thats a famous version called The Septuagint  It was a translation
made by Greek Jews
 and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward

No

   I dont know what youre referring to here  When the Jersusalem Temple was
destroyed some manuscripts may have been lost but I think our extant Hebrew
manuscripts are as good as our Greek ones I dont know about any originals
The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks
had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscriptsscrolls
and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated 
perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
in power groups heI dunno

No The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever
built in the world The Greeks had a love of wisdom philo sophos and
this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library The Christians 
got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems 
invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling 
into Moslems hands far more likely since they were the book burners not the 
Moslems or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it 
Either way a tremendous amount of information was lost The destruction of the
library of Alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man
against man

 So I was just wondering since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must 
have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions is the Hebrew version of the 
 Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version
   No  There are a few famous discrepancies Isaiahs prophecy about a young
woman was changed into a virgin which was how the New Testament writers
read it but not many

Actually the Hebrew almah young woman was translated as the Hellenistic 
Greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the
modern and technical English term virgin The Jews did not have the type
of virginity cult that the GrecoRomans had in Artemis and Diana

Well perhaps this is the answer then

   If you go to a Jewish bookstore youll get a Bible translated by Jews so
there will be some differences in interpretation but the text theyre 
translating from is basically the same

The standard text used by Christians and Jews is the Masoretic Text
Jews of course use the text in its original Hebrew without translation

   If you want to read the original you can buy an Interlinear Bible  That
contains the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament with an English
translation written underneath each word
   If you want a Bible with a possiblymoreoriginal basic text you can try
to find a Samaritan bible  Good luck  Ive never seen one The Samaritans 
no not the Good Samaritans have their own version of the 5 Books of Moses
They claim the Jewish bible was altered by Ezra

Propaganda

Thanks for the tips  Now I just have to find someone to teach me Samaritan 
Just me
little e
so is a good Samaritan hard to find or is a hard  Oh finish this
