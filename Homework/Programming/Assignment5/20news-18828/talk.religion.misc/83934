Human blood sacrifice Martyrdom of an innocent virgin Nailed to a
wooden pole What is this obsession with male menstruation

Christian  washed in the blood of the lamb
Mithraist  washed in the blood of the bull

If anyone in netland is in the process of devising a new religion
do not use the lamb or the bull because they have already been
reserved  Please choose another animal preferably one not
on the Endangered Species List  



How about Cockroaches
