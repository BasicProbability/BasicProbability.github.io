 Koresh was killed because he wanted lots of illegal guns

Even if what you say is true do you think this is a reasonable way
to deal with people who want lots of illegal guns

What makes you say that the guns were illegal I understand that the BDs
had a valid Class III Federal Firearms Permit which would allow them to
have pretty much anything short of a howitzer legally
