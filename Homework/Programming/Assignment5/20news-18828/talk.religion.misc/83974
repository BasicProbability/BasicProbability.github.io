For those who think David Koresh didnt have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
 I dont think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
 sermon  Its the deaths hes responsible for that concern most people

I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths
 
 Koresh was a nut okay  

Again Id like to see some evidence
 
 Ill type this very slowly so that you can understand  He either set
 the fire himself or told his followers to do so  Dont make him out to
 be a martyr  He did not get killed he killed himself

Once again wheres your proof Suicide is considered a sin by Branch
Davidians  Also Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to
commit suicide  Furthermore all the cult experts said that he was not
suicidal  David Thibedeau sp one of the cult members said that the fire
was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities
knocked over a lantern
 
 The evil was inside the compound  

Evidence please

 All that thou shalt not kill stuff

Id like to point out that the Bible says Do not commit murder The NKJ
translation mistranslates  Selfdefense was never considered murder  The
reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the
government would try something  Their fears were obviously well founded

Theres no government like no government
