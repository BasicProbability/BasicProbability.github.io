  Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
  for the message he carried Which says nothing about the 
  character of the messenger I reckon well have to find out
  the rest the hard way
  
 
 Koresh was killed because he wanted lots of illegal guns

I suppose these illegal guns have been found I suppose he was going to kill a
bunch of people with them
