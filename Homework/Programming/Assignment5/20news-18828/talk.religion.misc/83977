       I will agree that creation should not be taught as science 
       IF macroevolution is not taught as science  However if we are
       teaching the wildly speculative theories of macroevolution as
       an explanation of origins then equal time should be given
       to creation  Neither one qualifies as science  Create a
       philosophy course Call it Origins

    Interesting idea

    This suggestion has inspired me to post under the title Theories 
of Creation a collection of various philosophies of creation that 
I am aware of  Could you explain which of these theories you would
want taught and which ones you would not  Or perhaps I havent
included a favorite theory of yours if so could you describe it for
me for inclusion in an updated list
