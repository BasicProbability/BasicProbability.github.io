Some
people even raised protests when we had a moment of silence for a class
member who had tragically died saying this implied endorsing religion

Because of course that possibility existed  Meaning any student who
really gave a shit could have a moment of silence on hisher own which
makes more sense than forcing those who DONT want to participate to
have to take part  What other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence

A moment of silence doesnt mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise its not silent now is it

Nonreligious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead
classmate 1 to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased  2 to give the classmates a moment to grieve together 3
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school 4 to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that its not disruptive later

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic
