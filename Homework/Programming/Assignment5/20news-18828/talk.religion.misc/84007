stSeems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
stfor the message he carried Which says nothing about the 

kmSeems to be barring evidence to the contrary that Koresh was simply
kmanother deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of
kmfolks with him children and all to satisfy his delusional mania Jim
kmJones circa 1993

I think theres plenty of evidence to the contrary  six rescued
Davidians consistantly recounted that the Federal tank knocked over a barrel
of propane These guys havent exactly been spending time together
plotting an elaborate and consistent story It would be contradictory
for Koresh to go for mass suicide  remember that Koreshs death was
the opening of the sixth seal  the signal that Armageddon had begun
His army the people in the compound would then fight the powers of
evil and win ending in the Rapture The fire wiped out his army I
read earlier that Koresh was planning to walk out of the compound 
and blow himself up with a grenade  that would jibe better with
his teachings

stIn the mean time we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption
stAre you surprised things have gotten that rotten

kmNope  fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption
kmfor centuries

Id think youd be the last one to support gassing people and 
burning them to death for their religious beliefs Corrupt Evil
I dont know Well never know And when you start calling people 
fruitcakes about their religious beliefs thats dehumanizing people
We saw what happened when many Germans started believing that Jews
were subhuman

In one neat stroke they destroyed all the evidence that could have 
pointed to wrongdoing And killed all the witnesses including 12
children whose last view of life was choking and pain followed by
burning them alive

I am extremely saddened that this tragedy occurred Im furious that
they used my money to do it 


So I become an accessory 		Dave Criswell

 To the victim on my doorstep
 Only way I can justify
 Its family business   Fish
