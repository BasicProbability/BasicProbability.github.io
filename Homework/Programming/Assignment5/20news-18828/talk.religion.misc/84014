For those who think David Koresh didnt have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
 I dont think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
 sermon  Its the deaths hes responsible for that concern most people

I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths
 
 Koresh was a nut okay  

Again Id like to see some evidence

  Nut or not he was clearly a liar  He said he would surrender after
  local radio stations broadcast his message but he didnt  Then he
  said he would surrender after Passover but he didnt

  None of which excuses the gross incompetence and disregard for the
  safety of the children displayed by the feds   As someone else
  pointed out if it had been Chelsea Clinton in there you would 
  probably have seen more restraint
