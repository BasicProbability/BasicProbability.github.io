 David Thibedeau sp one of the cult members said that the fire
was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the 
facilities knocked over a lantern
 
In two places at once Bit of a coincidence that

Never lived out in the country I see 4 years ago I had a place
where I had to carry in propane every month hook the bottle up 
to copper line to supply both the stove and a type of water
heater called a flashheater A flash heater has a pilot lamp

Heres the point If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked 
up to copper or some such lines run through the ceiling spaces
 when the FBI started wrecking the place they could easily have
ruptured the lines Which then would start spreading out through
the overhead And since it was a country home it wasnt necessarily
built with nonflamable insulation 

Its probably more plausible than anything else that the fire started
mainly as a result of accident  or willful negligence on the part of
the FBI which should have known better ie manslaughter

Its certain that if the tanks hadnt been used that day  the fire
wouldnt have started

Whatever the faults the FBI had the fact is that responsibility
for those deaths lies with Koresh

Paul what fact
