For those who think David Koresh didnt have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
 I dont think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
 sermon  Its the deaths hes responsible for that concern most people

I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths
 
 Koresh was a nut okay  

Again Id like to see some evidence
 
  Nut or not he was clearly a liar  He said he would surrender after
  local radio stations broadcast his message but he didnt  Then he
  said he would surrender after Passover but he didnt

The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast
was for primetime and that Koresh never even heard it played Wasnt
even tuned in to the radio when it aired  so no reason to come out

If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire 
transcript  Im certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of
evil itself 

As to coming out after Passover wasnt that just one of the lawyers
speculations Peter
