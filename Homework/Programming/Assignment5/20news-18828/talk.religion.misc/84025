 Here tis  Someone just told me that the Old Testament books were translated
 into Greek a long time ago

   Yes thats a famous version called The Septuagint  It was a translation
made by Greek Jews

 and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward

   I dont know what youre referring to here  When the Jersusalem Temple was
destroyed some manuscripts may have been lost but I think our extant Hebrew
manuscripts are as good as our Greek ones  I dont know about any originals

The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks
had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscriptsscrolls
and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated 
perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
in power groups heI dunno

 So I was just wondering since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must 
 have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions is the Hebrew version of the 
 Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version

   No  There are a few famous discrepancies Isaiahs prophecy about a young
woman was changed into a virgin which was how the New Testament writers
read it but not many

Well perhaps this is the answer then

   If you go to a Jewish bookstore youll get a Bible translated by Jews so
there will be some differences in interpretation but the text theyre 
translating from is basically the same

   If you want to read the original you can buy an Interlinear Bible  That
contains the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament with an English
translation written underneath each word

   If you want a Bible with a possiblymoreoriginal basic text you can try
to find a Samaritan bible  Good luck  Ive never seen one  The Samaritans 
no not the Good Samaritans have their own version of the 5 Books of Moses
They claim the Jewish bible was altered by Ezra

Thanks for the tips  Now I just have to find someone to teach me Samaritan 

Just me

little e

so is a good Samaritan hard to find or is a hard  Oh finish this
yourself
