       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you dont want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony  

  Bill I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is
probably the weakest evidence

  What is probably the most convincing is the antiChristian literature put out
by the Jewish councils in the second century  There are enormous quantities of
detailed arguments against Christianity many of the arguments still being used
today  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity not one denies the
existance of Jesus only of his activities

  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the
gospels especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a
source
