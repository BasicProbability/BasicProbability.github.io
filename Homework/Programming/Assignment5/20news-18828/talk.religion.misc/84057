 You sound absolutely convinced Tell me how long did it last what color
 was it

Since you asked from the Big Bang to the formation of atoms is about
10E11 seconds As for the color bright Very very bright 

It must be so exciting to know for sure

I dont I believe the current theory of cosmology because it is fairly
well supported by observational evidence not as well supported as say
evolution or relativity but thats another matter Youre the one who

Miracles are supported by someones sayso
