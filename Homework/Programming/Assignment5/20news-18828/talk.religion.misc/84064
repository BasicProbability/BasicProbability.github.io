Subject Re Burden of Proof

In article 1993Apr21182030888batmanbmdtrwcom jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom writes
 The default condition in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable
And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that heshe
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who
holds no burden of proof  This is why the socalled weak atheist
position is virtually unassailable  not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument but because its proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of Gods and therefore they hold no burden
of proof  When you dont assert anything you dont have to prove
anything  Thats where weak atheism draws its strength  But its
strength is also its Achilles heel  Without assertionsaxioms one
has no foundation upon which to build  As a philosophy its virtually
worthless  IMO of course

Yes as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless  This is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians disbelief in
Zeus is worthless  Atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources building nongodbased ideas in the same
way as Christians build nonZeusbased ideas of thunderbolts
Atheists no more base their philosophy on atheism than Christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus

The weak atheist position is logically extremely assailable  any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration and they all fail
miserably  In fact most of the people around here who claim the
strong as opposed to mathematical atheist position do so on this
basis not only do we not believe in a god but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound
therefore one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist  This doesnt apply to such philosophers gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable but these are not the gods of
popular religion and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable
