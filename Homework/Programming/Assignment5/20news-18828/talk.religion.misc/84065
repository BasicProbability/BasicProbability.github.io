Take light as another example  There are two theories particle and
wave  Each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point
So which is it particle or wave

  Your information on this topic is very much out of date  Quantum Electro
dynamics QED  which considers light to be particles has been experimentally
verified to about 14 decimal digits of precision under ALL tested conditions
Im afraid that this case at least in the physics community has been decided
Laymen should consult QED  The Strange Theory of Light and Matter by Richard
P Feynman and for the more technically minded theres The Feynman Lectures on
Physics by Feynman Leighton and Sands an excellent 3 volumes  Case closed
