 But how Its evident from the texts in Ezek 2628 that God isnt concerned
 about buildings or structures  God is concerned about people  The people and
 leadership Ezek 28 never did return as a city  Others may have come later
 and built a city but the people and leadership that God prophesied about in
 Ezek 2628 were never rebuilt as a city of people and leaders 


How incredibly fucking stupid  Of course the text is referring to the city
itself buildings bricks mortar etc  Otherwise it makes no sense to
refer to the future of Tyre as being reduced to nothing but a place to spread 
fishing nets

Is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you wont do to preserve 
your faith from admission of error DeCenso
