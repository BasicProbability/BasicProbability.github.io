I need to prioritize things in my life and this board is not all that important
to me  

Of course it is  It forms a very big part of your selfrespect  You come onto 
the board thinking youre some sort of apologeticist for your faith and you
routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions

This board will have
to wait until if ever I can organize my life to fit it in  I tried dropping
out but Sieferman coerced me to come back  He wont this time

I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out  

Its probably closer to the truth to say that you dont have the cards to 
play in this game because you insist on playing from a losing hand and youre
finally realizing it  You will lurk on the board and keep 
quiet for a while looking for an area where you are certain that you 
are correct and then well see you pop back in again  Of course you then
will say that you have merely returned because your life is now in order

But well know better
