 Probably not  But then I dont pack heavy weaponry with intent to use it
 You dont really think he should have been allowed to keep that stuff do 
 you  If so tell me where you live so I can be sure to steer well clear

I understand that they had the neccessary licenses and permits to own
automatic weapons  

 The public also has rights and they should be placed above those of the
 individual  Go ahead call me a commie but youd be singing a different
 tune if I exercised my right to rape your daughter  He broke the law he
 was a threat to society they did there job  simple

I havent seen any proof or even evidence that the BDs had broken the
law  If you have proof or evidence lets hear it  The FBI said so is
NOT evidence

  
 Ill support them all except no 2

I guess there will always be people who wish to be peasants  The politicians
prefer unarmed peasants
