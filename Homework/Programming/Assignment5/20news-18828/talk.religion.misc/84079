 And I felt torn when I began to disagree with a lot of what the Bible
 and my priests told me 

Did it start getting a little uncomfortable  Did your style start feeling a
bit cramped

Yes thats exactly what I felt  My heart just felt that what I was
being taught was wrong  a basically good message but framed in
errors  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were
somehow not equal to men that homosexuals are guilty of their
lifestyle that pride in ones work is a bad thing that Jesus died
for me  I dont want ANYBODY to die for me especially as an
impersonal act where the person cant possibly even know me well
enough to really know if Im worth dying for or not

I was never able to accept the bit about Jesuss death being a good
thing  If that means that Im just not comprehending a basic message
of Christianity then so be it  Maybe Im just not compatible with
Christianity  I just refuse to follow rules blindly and since I
cant even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you
describe it Ive got to just follow my own conscience in these matters

I know how that goes  Knowing I couldnt and didnt want to 
live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me
outside too  

Dont think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I
dont believe in your god  I will not steal and I will not murder 
not because I fear divine repudiation but because these just arent
in my character  You may think theres nothing keeping me from just
running around on a murdering spree stealing things when Im able
insulting people for the heck of it because Im not answerable to
anyone but youd be wrong  Im answerable to myself  A life like
that would be a cheap life I happen to want to earn respect in myself

Till I met the Man that is

My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soulsearching
and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the presence of
God with me  I finally decided that I had once felt this presence
just as I had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a
little tyke protecting me from the monsters under the bed  that I
had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear as
something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers

Since then Ive never abandoned the possibility that maybe your
supernatural trinity does exist  But there are a few times when in
my darkened room by my bed I have set aside everything I believe for
a moment and called out to whatevers out there because I want to
know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know  And I
have not yet received an answer

 Only when I truly listened to myself body and soul did I realize
 that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being
 Christian  There is a higher truth in the universe and Christianity
 just aint it

Any suggestions on what or who or where it might be and why

Nope  It may well be unknowable  Scientists have suggested that the
universe may be finite and wrap around on itself the threedimensional
universe may be mapped onto a fourdimensional supersphere in the same
way you can map a twodimensional plane onto a threedimensional
sphere see Sphereland the sequel to Flatland for more thoughts
on this  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four
dimensional universe which in turn may only be an insignificant speck
in a universe above that and so on and so forth until the variables
become too much for us to even speculate on

That is theres no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to
be so theres no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor
had anything to do with it

OK you may say So now if Im just being good am I doing good enough

Thats for you to answer  If you feel youre doing fine then go ahead and
ignore us foolish little Christians  We can present what weve seen and
experienced providing our witness but it isnt up to us to make that seed
sprout  

Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy
book and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt
trips insinuations that Im without morals arguments from disbelief
how can you possibly believe that God doesnt exist and so
forth  All Im asking is for you to convince me  I want to be convinced
but its not going to be easy

So much as you dont like what were selling there just may be someone
out there that can identify with it  Methinks you could give us all a 
lesson in tolerance and back off

Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both
the inside and the outside I view it as harmful in many ways  It
preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives and once its
got these people it teaches them to have pity and sometimes starkly
intolerant of others who do not share these views  Maybe youll say
that your religion doesnt teach that  but Ive got to judge
Christianity from the Christians I know

I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in ones
self and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason
than that

So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some
people think  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly
valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity
whatsoever and I want people who are considering Christianity to
realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy
fulfilled life

I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice
things  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses
is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong and
they know the weaknesses of their religion yet they still decide to
believe but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think
any less of people who dont agree with them

Obviously the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the
Christians faith is far from conclusive notwithstanding how vehemently we
propose otherwise

Precisely my point  Youve still not given me a reason to be a
Christian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem

 The nice thing about religion if you lose yourself deeply enough in
 it is that eventually youll be able to feel justified in most
 anything you want to do

Yknow your right  Fortunately for everyone around me Im not religious  
Im a Christian

 just as the Moslems arent religious and the Buddhists arent
religious  Who is religious then
