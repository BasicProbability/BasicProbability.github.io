It is so simple Im surprised that this subject gets
beat to death about once a month A quick glance in a dictionary
would clear up 99 of the confusion and bandwidth in this
newsgroup

Reading Stephen Jay Goulds essay Evolution as Fact and Theory wouldnt
hurt either  It appears in Hens Teeth and Horses Toes

            Then we could talk about really important things
like why do men have nipples

See Goulds Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples in Bully for Brontosaurus

Gee this is easy
