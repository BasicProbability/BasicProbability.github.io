  Seems to me Koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
  for the message he carried Which says nothing about the 
  character of the messenger I reckon well have to find out
  the rest the hard way
  
 
 Koresh was killed because he wanted lots of illegal guns

I havent heard of ANY illegal guns being found  He was accused
of not paying taxes on LEGAL guns
