 armed to the teeth  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
 to defend himself  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence
 
 Faith and intelligence tell me that when a druggie breaks into my house at
 night with a knife to kill me for the 2 in my wallet a 357 is considerably
 more persuasive than having devotions with him

Give him the 2 leave the house and call the police  Thats what I would
do  I will not kill to protect mere possessions

Peace be with you
