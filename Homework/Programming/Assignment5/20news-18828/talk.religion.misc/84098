A moment of silence doesnt mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise its not silent now is it

Nonreligious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead
classmate 1 to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased  2 to give the classmates a moment to grieve together 3
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school 4 to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that its not disruptive later

Yeah all well and good The fact is though that the proschool
prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way
to get prayer back At my high school for instance our dear
principal ended the moment of silence with Amen

I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesnt require 
opposing a moment of silence

Ill back off when they do

Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer arent going to back off when
they cant even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently
