This was obviously a lot different than the ordinary FBI adventure

I believe that the Federal officers had a conflict of interests here

Throught out the whole affair it seamed to me that they were chiefly
concerned with saving face rather than saving lifes  Its true that
The BD were resisting arrest and that they should have surrendered
when they first realized that these where federal officers  But they
didnt
 
Im not sure what you mean by saving face unless you are confusing
the FBI with the BATF who are the ones who were in charge of the
original search warrant
 
But when they didnt the FBI should not have treated as a hostage
situation it wasnt

I think  more discussions possible independant negotiators and
family intervention should have been used

Independant Negotiators What was there to negotiate Any sort of plea
bargin has to be brought to the court the negotiators cant negotiate
charges or sentences FBI negotitators did make a deal for the
Dividians to come out Koresh showed he was not negotiating in good
faith and there is no reason to believe independent negotiators
would have done any better
