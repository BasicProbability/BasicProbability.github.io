Dear Brother Bill

One way or another  so much for patience Too bad you couldnt just 
wait Was the prospect of Gods Message just too much to take

  So do you want the president to specifically order each and every activity
of the FBI or what  And how willing are you to blame Reagan and Bush
directly for the incidents that took place in the War on Drugs in their
administration  Are you going to blame Bush for the fact that Weavers wife
infant son were killed  It happened while he was president

 or consider the thousands in Central America killed by those brave
CIANSC sponsored Freedom Fighters

Thus far Slick Willie is a piker
