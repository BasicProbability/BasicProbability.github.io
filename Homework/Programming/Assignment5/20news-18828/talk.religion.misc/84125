I would like to add my support for a misctaoism discussion group
I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting 79899cupportalcom 
Thyagicupportalcom I read in altmagick but I differ
with himher in believing that at least some minimal parameters 
should be agreed upon

Thyagi wrote

 I recommend that the depth of generality indeed of AMBIGUITY in this
 newsgroup misctaoism be maximized  Calling the Tradition old or new
 is rather unnecessary and only leads to foolish squabbles  There is no
 doubt that Nature is a splendid teacher whether she appears in the words
 spoken by a tree or by a stream a microbe or a star  Let us not limit
 misctaoism to philosophy  

But if we dont limit it to something the discussion degenerates into
a big amorphous glob 

Other questions Thyagi proposes are

 1 What is this actual process of reality
 2 Why is Taoism based upon an assumption
 3 Why does this assumption concern knowledge and what can be known
 4 What is the value of not knowing
 5 What is a Tao  What does it mean to be Taod

It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
category of general metaphysics I would prefer any misctaoism
to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
with at least semiorthodox Taoism with established classic works 
definitely included and works like Mantak Chias argued about 

I think neoTaoism should be excluded or get its own group what I
mean by this is HumptyDumpty Taoism in which Taoism means whatever 
a poster says it means This alttaoism could also be a refuge 
for debates about what Taoism REALLY means or speculations on sexual
alchemy etc

eg from Thyagi again
 Taoism does what the hell it wants I tell you
 Taoism doesnt exist  Taoism is no more real that Tao  Decide now
 Real or not real  Exist or notexist  When shall we be certain

Kent gloomily predicts quoting from Thyagis article

 However most traffic in 
 the group will likely concern the philosophical secular taoism
 averred by Alan Watts and Niels Bohr and yogic taoism as it pertains
 to medical sexual and martial techniques

I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of
place Whats happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic Alchemy 
Zen etc by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
want This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The
Tao of this that and everything else With respect to some exceptions
like the books by Jou TsungHwa

Any other commentsideas I look forward to seeing them On balance
I say let misctaoism rip and let the chips fall where they may If
it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
these groups just as they do now
