 Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call
 themselves Christian and yet are not  The BDs contradicted scripture
 in their actions  They were NOT Christian  Simple as that  Perhaps
 you have read too much into what the media has portrayed  Ask any
 truebelieving Christian and you will find that they will deny any
 association with the BDs  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any
 further ties with this cult which was what they were

Well if they were Satanists or followers of an obscure religion
then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and 
make this to a show case

You might be sure but you would also be wrong

And does not this show the dangers with religion  in order 
word a mind virus that will make mothers capable of letting
their small children burn to ashes while they scream

I suspect the answer to this question is the same as the answer to
Do not the actions of the likes of Stalin show the dangers of
atheism
