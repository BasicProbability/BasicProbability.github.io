At my high school for instance our dear
principal ended the moment of silence with Amen

An extremely good example of circumstantial evidence
Every time these rightwing controlfreaks start spouting
about prayer in schools I get this nagging commentary
from the Sermon on the Mount Matt 656 And when you
pray do not imitate the hypocrites they love to say their
prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street
corners for people to see them  I tell you solemnly they
have had their reward  But when you pray go to your
private room and when you have shut your door pray to
your Father who is in that secret place

But no THEY want PUBLIC prayers the better to manipulate
children  Amen indeed

When the proschoolprayer types stop trying to sneak religion
in Ill stop opposing everything that even looks remotely
like religion thank you

I hope you dont mind if I say amen to this
