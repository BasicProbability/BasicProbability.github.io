I can certainly see opposing the Amen  but that doesnt require 
opposing a moment of silence

If the ONLY people proposing a moment of silence are doing so as a
sham to sneak in prayers then it MUST be opposed  What the HELL have
prayers to do with public schooling  I ask this question as a devout
Christian

Ill back off when they do

Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here  I guarantee
you the people who want school prayer arent going to back off when
they cant even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray
silently

Their kids can bloodywell pray any Goddamned time they WANT to  And
nothing on heaven or earth in government or the principals office
can prevent or in any other way deal with their doing so  Especially
if the prayer is silent as bursting out into the Shema Yisrael or
some other prayer might be construed as disruptive if audible 
No one ever prevented ME from praying in public school  They hardly
even prevented me from masturbating in study hall

I should have thought better of someone posting from a UChicago address
How can you manage to say such nonsense without shame

Muslim students might have a complaint if they are prevented from setting
out their rugs and doing the proper ablutions before prayer at the times
specified in the Quran  Jews would probably like the opportunity to daven
with tefillim and whatever else they require at their appropriate times
I do not see THEM complaining though Muslims and Jews have a case that no
Christian I have ever heard has been able to make

The Christian insistence on a PUBLIC UNIVERSAL ENFORCED moment of
prayerHHHHHHsilence is nothing but the Inquisition naturalized
into the American context  It is offensive to the Gospel of Christ
