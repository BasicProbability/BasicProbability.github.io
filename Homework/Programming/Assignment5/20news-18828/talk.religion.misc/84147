As a Latterday Saint I found Johns statement not at all ludicrous

Please allow me to explain myself  In 1838 the governor of Missouri
governor Boggs issued his socalled Mormon extermination order  The
only crime illegal activity the Latterday Saints had committed was
their religious affiliation their antislave stance Missouri still
allowed slave practices and their growing numbersinfluence in Missouri

I guess the Mormons got what they deserved because they refused to bow
to the will of corrupt and evil secular authorities This disobedience
brought upon them persecution murder and finally forced expulsion from
their lands and settlements

It is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
average people and that at the time almost all Americans were pretty
homogeonously Christian It was largely the mainstream Christians disgust
at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred

True but that is exactly the problem the Mormon extermination order
was issued not just by a Christian it was ALLOWED under the Constitution
of the United States which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents
like this order from occurring in the first place  As I indicated in
an earlier posting your irrational hatred is clearly evidenced by
individuals like Robert Weiss who could have been Gov Boggs Lieutenant
he would have fitted right in drewling et al and seems a modernday
occurrence based on results slander persecution misrepresentation
lies denying Mormons representation in their own user group etc etc

In intent and purpose what really has changed

The situation is not entirely different today  Many irrational feelings
and beliefs are justified through religion  I dont think most of them
are started because of religion but religion certainly helps justify and
perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification
which discourages critical thought

True as evidenced by numerous examples as I am sure youre aware

In any regard Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities and
I dont even discuss how Uthans were suckered into allowing part of their
lands in becoming nervegas and atomic bomb testing grounds is far from
being trusted or righteous  Have things really changed for the better  I
may be a born cynic but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
case In the early 1980s I believe the late President Kimball lds church
leader strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MXPeace Keeper
missile maze from being built in Utah yet another inspired decision from
secular authorities  Fortunately his opposition was influential enough
for the feds to back off

Do you mean that the secular authorities are some continuous group of
people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassingeradicating the
Mormons  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
nuclear testing etc was to get them thar Mormons  And what about the
majority of Uthans who arent Mormons  You seem to be searching for enemy
 
Correction the majority of Utahns ARE Mormon 6070 I believe up to a
 100 in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states

conspiracies  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you
badly must have been done primarily for that purpose

What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched as we believe
that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert
truth judgment and justice  In addition we believe that the adversary
has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous greed for money would be
a good example in order to bring about persecution war oppression and
evil combinations  As an intelligent being dont you suppose that the
destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power

As far as Utah is concerned what I pointed out were some horrible examples
of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities which have
brought death disease ie the downwinders and environmental contami
nation  I am hardly paranoid I am just not expecting too much from a
secular government that may not share our values and faith and which indeed
as Gov Boggs et al may be out to harm and destroy us  As a matter of
fact prophecies in my church indicate that in future years global
persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope that
paraphrasing all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must
flee to Zion  Zion the pure in heart will be reestablished in those
days and it AINT our current secular authorities who will rule over it

  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation and with
John I too wonder who or whats next

I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
life of even one person  Sure he did not pose a threat to the security of
this nation  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers  That
much is definite

Hmmm  definite by whom  Until such has been established beyond reason
able doubt this alleged threat may have been less than the threat
imposed upon him and his followers by the BATF and FBI

Who killed who  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound
What REALLY caused the murder of the little children  Could it be that
the ATFFBI presence has any bearing upon the events  How would you
interpret the Mt Masada events  Blame the Jews  What the heck did
the Romans do there anyway  What business did the ATFFBI has in Waco
Texas  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society

This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
team in 1976  In that case the police botched the job as well  But to
lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible
mistake  I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case
Certainly if David Koresh chose any peaceful option the ATF and FBI
would have complied  The responsibility is more his than the authorities

Come now at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise
peaceful standoff lets get it over with and force David Koresh to
come out  By gassing them  Were they naive or what  They played
right into the hands of an apocalypticthinking individual he had prepared
his people for this eventuality for years and not one firetruck or plan
was in place to deal with this scenario  I feel that the authorities
had some responsibility to protect their own citizens even if they were
religious zealots and guilty of  not paying a 200 gun license
Has the BATF become an extension of the local taxcollectors

David Koresh no doubt will be described as the evil guy by the
executioners while the actions of all those valiant and brave officers

Characterizing the ATFFBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair  In
order to be an executioner the least one must have done is have the intent
to kill

Que Intrusion into private property with semis loaded with life
ammunition isnt that implicit intent or at least prepared to kill
I ask you would the BATF warrant stand up in a civil court of justice
I do not mind if criminals such as dangerous drug lords are brought to
justice but escalating events to the point of allowing to if not compli
city with the destruction of a people
