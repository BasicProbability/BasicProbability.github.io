Subject Re A Message for you Mr President How do you know what happened

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

How do you know Were you there

While obviously Koresh was a nut case the typical inability of the
governmentmedia to get its story straight is quite disturbing On
tuesday night NBC news reported that the FBI did not know the place
was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the
building The next day FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians
setting the fire The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible
their battery of the compounds wallks could have accidentally set the
blaze while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating
of the site because it was still too hot So how did they KNOW they
didnt accidentally set the fire

Sounds like the FBI just burned the place to the ground to destroy
evidence to me
