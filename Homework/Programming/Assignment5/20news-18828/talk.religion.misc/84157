 A definiation from a text book used as part of an introductory course in
 social anthorpology The term myth designates traditionally based dramatic
 narratives on themes that emphasize the nature of humankinds relationship
 to nature and to the supernatural   legends are ususally defined as
 tales concerning other times and places that do not give the same extensive
 emphasis to supernatural themes Legends more often than myths are retold
 purely as entertainment from Peter B Hammands An introduction to
 Cutural and Social Anthropology second ed Macmillion page 387 This makes
 the Bible a Fibber Magees closet over stuffed with a little bit of every

     Now doesnt this sound a lot like the colorful or otherwise story 
     from antiquity that somehow tries to or does explain natural pheno
     mena  I think I hear what youre saying but Im not convinced that
     I know what you mean  The possibility exists that what looks like
     myth on the surface may be after all much more than just a story
