Ive asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me

Brian K I am pleased with your honesty  And to be honest as well I
believe you have not asked my god to come to you  Why do I say this

Because that would contradict your religious beliefs therefore
you feel more comfortable simply accusing his sincerity so you will
not have to critically examine your religious beliefs
