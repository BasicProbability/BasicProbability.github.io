LM  The rape has passed there is nothing that will ever take that away

LMLMTrue  But forcing her to remain pregnant continues the violation of
LMLMher body for another 9 months  I see this as being unbelievably cruel
LM
LMLife is not a violation

LMBut forcing someone to harbor that life in their body is a violation

Letting a mother force a child from her body in order to end that
childs life is the ultimate violation

I happen to take the violation of a person much more seriously than the
violation of a mindless clump of cells smaller than my thumb

Your mileage may vary
