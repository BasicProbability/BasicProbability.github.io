Subject What we can learn from the Waco wackos


	There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess
1	When they start getting desperate for an answer to the question Whats
it all about Mr Natural pinkboys will buy darn near anything which
means
2	Theres still plenty of  to be made in the False Jesus business
by enterprising SubGenii  Just remember that
3	Once youve separated the pinks from their green dont blow it all
on automatic weapons from Mexico  Put it in a Swiss bank account  Smile a
lot  Have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports  The Con will just
shrug you off as long as
4	You never never NEVER start to believe your own bulldada  If
David Koresh handt started swallowing his own apocalypso now crap hed
be working crossword puzzles in the Bahamas today instead of contributing to
the mulch layer in Waco  This is because
5	When you start shooting at cops theyre likely to shoot back  And 
most of em are better shots than you are

	In short
	 PT Barnum was right 
		and
	 Stupidity is selfcorrecting
Thus endeth the lesson
