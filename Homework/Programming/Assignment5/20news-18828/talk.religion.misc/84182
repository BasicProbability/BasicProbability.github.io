Jesus comments about how Christians have to follow the OT deleted

I will clarify my earlier quote  Gods laws were originally written for 
the Israelites  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
all people not just the Jews  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
Heaven through the saving grace of God  I never said that the Law was made
obsolete by Jesus

Exodus 311217  How many people have you put to death for working on
the Sabbath

If anything He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made  In the
following verses Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended  If youll notice He
also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived
interpretations  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts  That is why He points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of Heaven  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin
They had become legalistic rulemakers  religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the Law but never really believed in it  

Leviticus 1710  How as that mediumrare steak last night

I think you will agree with me that there are in todays world a lot of
modernday Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart

Leviticus 1919  What did you wear to work friday

Christianity is not just a set of rules its a lifestyle that changes ones
perspectives and personal conduct  And it demands obedience to Gods will

Deutromony 181  I can you can now justify discrimination

Some people can live by it but many others cannot or will not  That is their
choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too

Right

God be with you

She is
