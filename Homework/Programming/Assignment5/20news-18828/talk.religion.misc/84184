Subject Re Burden of Proof

Actually both are positive arguments  Positive may not be the best
description here due to possible misunderstanding but its the term you
used  Positive argumentsassertions can be both affirmative ie God 
exists and negative ie God does not exist  Both carry an equal 
burden of proof because they are both asserting that a certain idea
is true  The default condition in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable
And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that heshe
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true is the only one who
holds no burden of proof  This is why the socalled weak atheist
position is virtually unassailable  not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument but because its proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of Gods and therefore they hold no burden
of proof  When you dont assert anything you dont have to prove
anything  Thats where weak atheism draws its strength  But its
strength is also its Achilles heel  Without assertionsaxioms one
has no foundation upon which to build  As a philosophy its virtually
worthless  IMO of course

	So if I were to assert that there are no thousand year old 
invisible pink unicorns residing in my walls I need to support this with 
evidence I think the lack of evidence shall suffice

         forced followers to remain as flames closed in Koreshs 
         armed guard may have injected as many as 24 children with 
         poison to quiet them
