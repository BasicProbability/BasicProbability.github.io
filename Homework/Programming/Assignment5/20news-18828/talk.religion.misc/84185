Andy I think we do agree given your clarification of how we were 
each using the terms fact and theory  Ill only add that I
think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them
though your usage is quite valid

Note that the fact of evolution is still a theory  In other words it
could theoretically still be falsified and rejected  But since its
so predictive and so consistently supported by evidence it seems
pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore

Ill add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way
reduce its current usefulness  So long as it accurately predicts or 
describes things we can observe

Not to be a pain in the ass but is there any reason you dont
just say the theory of evolution rather than the fact of evolution
is still a theory  Im asking because this whole thread got started
because I was bothered by a post that referred to the fact of evolution
basically leaving off the phrase is still a theory  Without a 
clarification like the one you just gave just saying the fact of
evolution has a very different meaning to me

description of atomic theory and alternative theories of gravity deleted
Both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it

Here is where you fail to make an important distinction  You have
shoehorned the facts of the existence of gravity and atoms and
evolution into one category with the theories which have been
proposed to explain the mechanisms  The existence of these things
is so predictive as to be considered fact  The mechanisms on the
other hand are still worth discussing  

Im not sure I agree here  Again it may be because I feel stronger
about separating terms  I was trying to say that the theories
proposed to explain the mechanisms and the mechanisms themselves
are the only realities here  It is the existence of mechanisms not 
the things themselves that are so predictive as to be considered 
fact as you would say  There arent really little planetary particle 
systems called atoms out there  Or I should say and more to my original 
point it would be a leap of faith to say there are because we observe only 
the mechanisms  There is no need to believe there are actually
atoms out there as we have decided to think about them  Its enough
to discuss the mechanisms  At any rate Im not sure I am being 
any clearer than before but I thought it was worth a shot

The bottom line though is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas

   1 evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence my way
      the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational
        evidence your way

   2 creation is just an opinion  If a theist wants to call it
        a theory then he can  I wont  it has no supporting evidence 
	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can
        be made  With no mechanisms to talk about there really isnt
	much to say

Do you agree
