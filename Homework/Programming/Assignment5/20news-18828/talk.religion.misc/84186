 This is complete nonsense  Relativism means saying that there is no absolut
 standard of morality it does NOT mean saying that all standards of morality
 are equally good
 
 Presumably this means that some moral systems are better than others
 How so  How do you manage this without an objective frame of reference

Which goes faster a bullet or a snail  How come you can answer that when
Einstein proved that there isnt an objective frame of reference

Speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that
will result in the same value measured no matter the reference  A 
bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving 60mph
will be moving at a speed of

        a 0mph to someone on the train
        b 60mph to someone stationary next to the train

The reference frame makes the speed relative  But whats interesting
here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet
Every person off a bullet moving 60mph  

I know of no train where all the people on it every time it is
filled will see a moral problem in exactly the same way
