Prayer in school is legal what is illegal is telling children
what to pray or not to pray  Many people confuse you cant
tell kids that they ought to pray now with kids arent allowed
to pray possibly because so few kids do so without being told

Or perhaps its because they think that all governmental bodies should be in
the business of suppressing all beliefs other than their own or else theyre
some sort of Satanic Humanist Conspiracy

Its the old if youre not for us youre against us bit
