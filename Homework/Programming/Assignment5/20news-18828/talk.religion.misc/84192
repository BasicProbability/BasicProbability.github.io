Me  Brian K please step aside before you get run over 
BK  There is no truck
Me  Turn around at look
BK  No
Me  Look  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck
BK  No Explain to me why trucks exist
Me  Turn around or you will run over
BK  No I wont because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday
Me  You blind fool  Why do you choose ignorance You have nothing
      to lose if you look  But if do not look you will certainly lose your life
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road
BK  It is my life to lose  I rather not look
      Besides a truck running over me will not harm me
      And by the way I really have an open mind

I think the discussion is more like this

Me  happily picking daisies by the side of the road 
BC  dancing on the double yellow broken line 
    Come on out and play on the highway
Me Why
BC The highway was put here for people to be on  We must work towards
     fulfilling its purpose
Me But 
BC Look the highway has been here for several generations  Look I
     have a story about how it was actually created by a divine being
     And several people actually saw Elvis bless it
Me But 
BC Look are you going to come out here or not
Me But 
BC You probably think that picking daisies is fun  Well youre wrong
Me Where in blazes did you get this silly idea that youre supposed to
     be playing on the highway  Youll get yourself killed
BC Better to be killed on the highway than to live an empty life off
     of it  Besides youre just asking pointless questions  You know
     you really want to be playing on the highway too youre just
     denying it
Me If you want to get run over then fine but Id much rather enjoy
     the daisies if you please
BC Why do you shun me like this  The Creator of the Highway will flatten
     you with a steamroller if you dont see the light and come join me
Me Well if hes gonna be THAT way about it maybe I want to get as
     far from the highway as I can
BC  incoherent but quite familiar righteous sputtering 

Brian C dont you see  I do not believe that your god is

	a real or even

	b beneficial

In fact I believe your religion is imaginary and carried to
extremes harmful  I would like to help you see its shortcomings and
perhaps someday finally become strong enough to see it for what it is
an elaborate lie kept alive by the elite priesthood to keep the
masses properly submissive to their influences

Please offer me an argument thats more convincing than you just
dont believe cos you dont want to  Everything youve said so far
could apply equally to any religion  why do you believe yours is the
real one

Note that saying its the only one that promises eternal life or
something like that isnt an answer to my question unless you show
that a no other religion promises eternal life and b it is
unarguably true that eternal life must be a reality

    The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre
