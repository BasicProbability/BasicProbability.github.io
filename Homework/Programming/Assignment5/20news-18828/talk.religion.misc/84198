	They cut off the water there were no fire trucks present

They refused to bring in fire equipment for fear that the firemen
would be shot at

and the FBIATF go blasting holes into the builing and firing gas munitions

They used a tank to knock a hole in the wall and they released
nontoxic nonflammable tear gas into the building

	Take a second look at nontoxic nonflammable

		MACE sold tothe public is supposedly nontoxic
		Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly
		on the linings of the lungs such as a direct snort to
		the face above certain quantities it reacts similarly
		to a mustard gas inhalation

			I know  my father and grandfather were exposed
			to poison gas in WWI and WWII Dad went through
			the side effects of any WEAPON including those
			nontoxic aerosols

		WHat the label ACTUALLY means is 

			usually it wont kill you
			it may give you permanent CSS asthsma
			but thats better than blowing a hole in your
				head 

		ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN
		AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER  SOme of the most
		nonflammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME
		if you hit it with the right combo


		Lets take one  a trash can fire  Makes black smoke
		already burned right  Cant go boom right  Wrong

		Suck that smoke made up of paper that has carbonized
		or burned about 35 of the fuel in it into an air
		conditioning return mix with about 51 air and light
		a match  200 feet of conduit is about the same when
		filled with that smoke mixture as oh say 200 pounds TNT

			THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING
			TILES IN BUILDINGS  Because 35 stories of
			a building have blown OUT by nonflammable smoke

	So
		Take a little nonflammable aerosol
		Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes

			NO electricity remeber  A bit of heating
			on the WACO plains  Boil water to drink
			since the water was cut off

		liberally mix and allow to settle for 14 hours

		Fumes vent down into the bus underground and the Davidians
		move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom they had one
		armor plated remember to BREATH because kids get sick
		and die from tear gas

		and along comes a tracer a spark what have you

			everyone burns to death

Try thinking before opening mouth it may not have happened the
way the Gmen say it did
