BG1020Miller I am the self abiding in the heart of all creatures I am
their beginning their middle and their end
BG1032Miller I am the beginning the middle and the end of
creations Arjuna of sciences I am the science of the self I am the
dispute of orators
BG1041Miller Whatever is powerful lucid splendid or invulnerable
has its source in a fragment of my brilliance 42 What use is so much
knowledge to you Arjuna I stand sustaining this entire world with a
fragment of my being
BG1132Miller I am time grown old 

I can provide more names of perfect people should just one be insufficient
