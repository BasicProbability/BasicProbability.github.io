From ashsumexaimstanfordedu David Ash
Subject Theory on David Koresh 

My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle
and died on Day 9 of the siege  On Day 11 of the siege he rose from the
dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the
next 40 days  Living with someone whos risen from the dead isnt easy
as Timmy Batermans father in PetSematary could attest so after 40
days they did what Baterman didshot themselves and burned the place
to the ground

Consistent with the facts isnt it  Did anyone actually see Koresh
between Day 9 and Day 11
