I dont necessarily agree with Pat Robertson  Every one will be placed before
the judgement seat eventually and judged on what we have done or failed to do
on this earth  God allows people to choose who and what they want to worship

Im sorry but He does not  Ever read the FIRST commandment

I have  Apparently you havent  The first commandment doesnt appear to
forbid worshipping other gods  Yahwehs got to be at the top of the totem
pole though

Disclaimer  Hey I understand VAXen and VMS  Thats what I get paid for  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
