Hmm  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn clearly marked as
officers and yelling Police repeatedly  This is used every day to bust drug
houses  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and
display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight  As for not knocking its
a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even
fight  Usually this strategy works if it didnt then it wouldnt be used so
commonly now would it

How often is it used when the convoy carrying the brigade is visible for miles
before it reaches the place thats to be searched

Disclaimer  Hey I understand VAXen and VMS  Thats what I get paid for  My
understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level or below  So
unless what Im saying is directly related to VAXVMS dont hold me or my
organization responsible for it  If it IS related to VAXVMS you can try to
hold me responsible for it but my organization had nothing to do with it
