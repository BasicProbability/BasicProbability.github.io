 Let us not limit
 misctaoism to philosophy  

But if we dont limit it to something the discussion degenerates into
a big amorphous glob 

Hmmare you a Taoist  Imposing limits does do something usefulit gives
you something to go beyond

It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
category of general metaphysics I would prefer any misctaoism
to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
with at least semiorthodox Taoism with established classic works 
definitely included and works like Mantak Chias argued about 

I tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of Taoism  I especially
tend to frown on any suggestion that orthodoxy or classics have any
special place in Tao

I think neoTaoism should be excluded or get its own group what I
mean by this is HumptyDumpty Taoism in which Taoism means whatever 
a poster says it means This alttaoism could also be a refuge 
for debates about what Taoism REALLY means or speculations on sexual
alchemy etc

So rather than debate what Taoism REALLY means you are suggesting that
we take someone elses word for it and work thusly  Id rather not thank
you

Whats happening is that that the term Taoism is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic Alchemy 
Zen etc by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
want This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled The
Tao of this that and everything else

Whereas you of course have a clear idea of what the word means  Can
you tell the Tao 

Any other commentsideas I look forward to seeing them On balance
I say let misctaoism rip and let the chips fall where they may

Wonderful idea

it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
these groups just as they do now

Only if you choose to define failure in that way  Or to define it at all
