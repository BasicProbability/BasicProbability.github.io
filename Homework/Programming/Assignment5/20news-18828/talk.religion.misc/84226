If one is paying for a PRIVATE health insurance plan and DOES NOT WANT
abortion coverage there is NO reason for that person to be COMPLELLED
to pay for it  Just as one should not be compelled to pay for lipposuction
coverage if ONE doesnt WANT that kind of coverage

You appear to be stunningly ignorant of the underlying concept of health
insurance
