From walshaiccgccdecnetabcom I dont know who discovered water but it wasnt no fish  Marshall McCluhan
Subject waco conflagration  precedents


burning yourself alive seems a rough way to go given the waco bunch
had other choices

but it reminded me of the russian oldbelievers who thinking the
antichrist was coming in 1666 grew frantic when Peter the Great 
started westernizing Russia and reforming the Russian Church a few
years later They locked themselves in their churches and burned
themselves alive by the thousands 

are there other cases of apocalypseobsessed christians resorting
to selfimolation is there a history of precedents
