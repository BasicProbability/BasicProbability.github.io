I just started reading this newsgroup and havent been following the
thread Im just curious  How did this thread get started with
Albert Sabin and changed into something else  What was it about
Sabin that initiated a religious discussion

Its just variation within a thread  The variation at times has been so great
that speciation has occurred  So Albert Sabin is the common ancestor of
several threads some of which have themselves speciated  On a separate topic
I subscribed to to just recently  Albert Sabin existed at that time so I
have no clue as to its origins  Maybe the abiogenesists have an answer  I
might also point out that evolution is aimless  Thus why Albert 
Sabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable
