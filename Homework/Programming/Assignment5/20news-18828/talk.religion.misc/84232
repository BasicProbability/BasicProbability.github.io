  For your information I checked the Library of Congress catalog
and they list the following books by Francis Hitching

I believe Ive just discovered an anthopological parallel  In my many
discussions with the fundies their main tactic is to discredit
my sources  They shrilly bleat


Possibly the parallel just stems from your tending to use bad sources
Anyway dont you think that similarity is rather shallow  Youre only
looking at the surface at the way of argumentation  
And now you should perhaps go a little deeper and try to find the difference
for example find out whether you can find real science done by Hitching
If you cant will you then admit that your attempt at quoting an authority
has backfired

Johannes Scotus Eriugena the greatest European philosopher of the 9th century
said that if reason and authority conflict reason should be given preference
And if that doesnt sound reasonable to you youll just have to accept it
