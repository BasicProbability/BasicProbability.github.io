Subject Re After 2000 years can we say that Christian Morality is

In article C5v6rB37Fdarksideosrheuoknoredu bilokcforumosrheedu Bill Conner writes
Ive seen referrences to Creation vs Evolution several times in aa
and I have question Is either point of view derived from direct
observation can either be scientific I wonder if the whole
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the Truth
rather than the truth itself 
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome and I cant help
wondering which came first As Ive pointed out elsewhere my view of
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
anyhthing objectively  all knowledge is inherently subjective So in
the context of aa would you take a stand based on what you actually
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
the difference

Translation of the above paragraph
I am uninformed about the evidence for evolution  Please send me the
talkorigins FAQs on the subject

Johannes Scotus Eriugena the greatest European philosopher of the 9th century
said that if reason and authority conflict reason should be given preference
And if that doesnt sound reasonable to you youll just have to accept it
