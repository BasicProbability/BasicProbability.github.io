Subject Re Theists And Objectivity

trajancwisunomahaedu Stephen McIntyre writes
 Can a theist be truly objective  Can he be impartial
      when questioning the truth of his scriptures or
      will he assume the superstition of his parents
      when questioning 

I think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that
God definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that
the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a
theist 

 It usually all has to do with how the child is
      brought up  From the time he is born the
      theist is brought up with the notion of the
      truth of some kind of scripture the Bible
      the Torah the Quran  etc  He is told
      of this wondrous God who wrote or inspired
      the scripture of the prophets talked about in
      the scripture of the miracles performed  etc
      He is also told that to question this as
      children are apt to do is a sin a crime
      against God and to lose belief in the scrip
      tures truth is to damn ones soul to Hell
      Thus by the time he is able to read the
      scripture for himself the belief in its truth
      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
      matter of course

Youre missing something here  There are people who convert from
nontheism to theism after being brought up in a nontheist household  I
dont have any statistics as to how many though  That would be an
interesting thing to know  I think that religion is a crutch  People are
naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable  People dont want
to believe that when they die they are dead finished  That there is
nothing else after that  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy
Religion also describes things we dont know about the universe things
science has not yet described and it also gives people a feeling of
security that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok
That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions  This
has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
belief system for what it gains them  This is why I think its kind of
useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism  They are happy with
their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
they cant accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
the harsh reality that they are running from

Anyway Im getting kind of carried away here  But my point is that theism
doesnt have to be ingrained into a childs mindset for that person to grow
up as a theist although this happens far too often  Theism is designed
to have its own attractions

 
                      Atheist
                            Libertarian
                    Proindividuality
                                Proresponsibility
                  Jr     and all that jazz
