pmy Anyway Ive often wondered what business followers of Christ
pmy would have with weapons

fc Didnt Christ tell his disciples to arm them selves shortly
fc before his crusifiction I believe the exact quote was along the
fc lines of If you have something sell it and buy a sword

  If you have a purse it was

fc Certainly Christ said

fc Think not that I am come to send peace on earth I came not to
fc send peace but the sword  For I am come to set a man at variance
fc against his father and the daugher against her mother

fc Matthew 10 3435

  Yes He said this but the sword that Jesus brought was the sword of
the Word of God which divides between those that believe and those
who do not even right down a family
