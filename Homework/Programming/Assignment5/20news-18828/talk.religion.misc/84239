Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus  I realize it is normally tossed
out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons

 It is not tossed out as a source but would it be regarded as
unbiased and independant 

This brings up another something I have never understood  I asked this once
before and got a few interesting responses but somehow didnt seem satisfied
Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source  This might be a 
literaryhistorical question but when I studied history I always looked for 
firsthand original sources to write my papers  If the topic was on Mr X I 
looked to see if Mr X wrote anything about it  If the topic was on a group 
look for the group etc  If the topic is on Mr X and Mr X did not write 
anything about it barring the theistic response about the Bible being 
divinely inspired which I cant adequately argue wouldnt we look for people
who ate worked walked talked etc with him  If someone was at an event 
wouldnt they be a better reporter than someone who heard about it second 
hand  I guess isnt firsthand better than second hand  I know there is bias
and winners writing history but doesnt the principle of firsthand being best
still apply
