 If I make a statement That God exists loves me etc but in no way
 insist that you believe it does that place a burden of proof upon me

      No but youre not achieving anything either If you dont want to
argue the point youre stating why do you bother stating it

 If you insist that God doesnt exist does that place a burden of proof 
 upon you

      No Read the altatheism FAQ to find out why

 I give no proofs I only give testimony to my beliefs

      Well enough if I feel interested I might even listen

 I will respond to proofs that you attempt to disprove my beliefs

      I wont the task is impossible and I dont have to do it in the
first place Why should I even bother to change or disprove your beliefs
