          An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found 
        in the rubble had bullet wounds  The local coroner who is 
        independent of the FBI has so far found no bullet wounds 

According to CNN last night Saturday 42493 he has now found bullets
in two of the corpses in the head that would indicate that the bullets
were aimed at killing the humans
