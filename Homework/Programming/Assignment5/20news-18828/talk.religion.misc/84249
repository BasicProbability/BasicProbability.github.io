 Christ is Greek for Messiah  Messiah means Annointed One
 Annoint means to rub with oil ie to anoint by impl to
 consecrate     The major prophet Daniel uses the word Messiah

 How closely did you analyze the Bible  Looks as if you didnt
 get past the first word   So was the catalyst to break your faith the
 priests who interpreted the Bible for you   Did you ever do what
 the Bereans did to Pauls teachings in Acts 17  

Brian does all this mean that you have to be well versed in ancient
Greek Hebrew and Aramaic in order to understand the core of
Christianity I hope you are not Catholic because my Christian
upbringing was based on the teachings of Luther and the one of
the core messages was basically that you dont need to know latin
in order to learn about salvation

BTW your statement would also eliminate about 995 of all the Christians
in the world as well

Cheers
