 You said everyone in the world  That means everyone in the world including
 children that are not old enough to speak let alone tell lies  If Jesus
 says everyone you cannot support that by referring to a group of people
 somewhat smaller than everyone
 
 Thats right  Everyone  Even infants who cannot speak as yet  Even
 a little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket
 Even a little child will not want his diaper changed  Even a little
 child will fight naptime

Oh boy get a small baby and figure out how much brain power they
have the first 6 months

Cheers
