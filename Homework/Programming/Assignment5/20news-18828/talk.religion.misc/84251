 Even though a newborn is innocent as can be his sinful nature
 will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older
 
 Ah so you admit newborns are innocent  Then you cannot say everyone is a
 sinner
 
 About the only way top get out of this one is to claim that a newborn is a
 sinner despite having not committed any sins which is rather odd

This all would also implicate that in order for the sinning 2 month
old baby to get forgivance he or she has to ask for help from Jesus
Somehow I find this a little bit amuzing
