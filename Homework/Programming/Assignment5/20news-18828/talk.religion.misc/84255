For those who think David Koresh didnt have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
 I dont think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
 sermon  Its the deaths hes responsible for that concern most people

I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths

Only my common sense  The fire was caused by either Koresh and his
followers or by the FBIATFCIAKGBand maybe the Harper Valley PTA  Since
you are throwing around the evidence arguement Ill throw it back  Can
you prove any government agency did it  Please dont resort to they 
covered it up so that proves they did it or any wild theories about how
the government agencies intentionally started the fire  The key words
are proof and evidence
proves they did it


 All that thou shalt not kill stuff

Id like to point out that the Bible says Do not commit murder The NKJ
translation mistranslates  Selfdefense was never considered murder  The

Please explain how Koresh was defending himself from those children who
burned
