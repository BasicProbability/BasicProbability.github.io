 I recall reading in Michael  Rutherfords novel Sarum a scene in
 which the son of a Roman nobleman living in Britain takes part in a
 secret ceremony involving a bull  He stands naked in a pit covered
 with some sort of scaffolding while assistants coax a bull to stand on
 the scaffolding  They then fatally stab the bull which douses the
 worshipper in the pit with blood  This is supposedly some sort of
 rite of passage for members of the bull cult  I wonder if this is
 related to the Mithras cult
 
 I dont know where Rutherford got his information for this chapter
 The book is historical fiction and most of the general events which
 take place are largely based on historical accounts
 
 There is a rite like this described in Joseph Campbells
 OccidentalMythology  He also described levels of initiation I think
 6  I dont know where Campbell got his info but I remember thinking he
 was being a little eclectic
 
 I also wonder what if any connection there is between the ancient bull
 cults and the current practice of bullfighting popular in some
 Mediterranean cultures
 
 Quite a bit  If you havent read Campbell give him a try

Yes  I cannot remeber which works I read about this in as it was many 
years ago  This ritual was called The Tarobaullum I believe The 
spelling may be off
