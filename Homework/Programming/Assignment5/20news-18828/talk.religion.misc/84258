  Lets say that we drop a marble into the black hole  It races ever faster
 towards the even horizon  But thanks to the curving of space caused by the
 excessive gravity as the object approaches the event horizon it has
 further to
 travel  Integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon
 of   
 infinity  So the math says that nothing can enter a black hole

Isnt that just a variation of the Achilles  the turtle paradox which
states that achilles could never possibly overtake a turtle
