Frank unless you didnt realize it you are just now involved
in a debate where we have various opinions and each entity
has its own frame where the opinion is expressed I think I 
dont need to state the dreadful rword

So its sometimes correct to say that morality is objective or what
After all I could hardly be wrong without dragging in the oword
For your part when you say that relativism is true thats just
your opinion  Why do folk get so heated then if a belief in relativism
is merely a matter of taste  to be fair you have been very calm
I get the impression thats because you dont care about notions of
objectivity in any flavour  Right
