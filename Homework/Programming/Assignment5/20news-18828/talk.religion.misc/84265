Lets start with the name Rosicrucian I took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a member of a
rosicrucian body and BEING a ROSICRUCIAN So when you say that you met
some rosicrucians you mean members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian At least that is what your observation suggests 


Response

This makes much sense to me  This is also true of most religions
There is a difference between being a member of a group of people
who call themselves Hindus or Christians or Pagans and actually
BEING any of these  The social groups tend to make very important
requirements about not belonging to other religions  I find that
the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be
interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that
mysticism is the core of every religion and Huxleys Perennial
Philosophy is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads 


Tony

Id prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium
Rosicrucianum only because they may be confused by some readers of this
newsgroup with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based the USA Jurisdiction in
San Jose CA this being the RC org with the most members last time I
looked Of course most members does not necessarily mean best


Response

Certainly true  I didnt know there WERE any groups which called themselves
Rosicrucians that didnt associate with AMORC  Sure Ive heard all the
hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these
Western esoteric groups but hadnt heard about other Rosicrucians
Ill admit my bias  I live in San Jose 


Tony

Youll have to trust me when I tell you that if that
lectureclasswhatever had been presented by AMORC it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression ie youd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one IMHO 


Response

This may be slightly off  Ive met some of these Rosicrucians and have
a couple friends in AMORC  The stories Ive heard and the slight contact
Ive had with them does not give me the hope that Id be received with
any kind of warm welcome  I still like to think that most people who
are involved with stratified relationships monogamy religion etc
are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a cast


Tony

     
It is curious to know that 3 other RC orders in the USA claim to be non
sectarian


Response

Id like to know at least the addresses of the other orders which call 
themselves Rosicrucians and especially those which are nonsectarian
Is this nonsectarian like the Masons who require that a member believe
in God by hisher definition

I dont see nothing fundamentally wrong with us containing
something divine And yes I dont like phrases like eternal bliss
either 


Response

Let alone us BEING something divine 


Tony

of charge


Response
