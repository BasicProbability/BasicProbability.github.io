 No  I also understand it I have read the Bible from cover to cover examining
 each book within crosscomparing them etc  And I have come to same conclusions
 as Robert Weiss
 
 So Rick why not read the Bible for yourself  It is written in plain
 english  Decide for yourself   

Im curious to know if Christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion classical text such as Age of Reason by Paine
or The Myth Maker by Jacobi Sometimes it is good to know your
enemy and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides and not solely the one and only right one
