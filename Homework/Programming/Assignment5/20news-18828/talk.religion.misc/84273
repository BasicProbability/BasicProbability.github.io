 armed to the teeth  A Christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
 to defend himself  A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence
 
 Faith and intelligence tell me that when a druggie breaks into my house at
 night with a knife to kill me for the 2 in my wallet a 357 is considerably
 more persuasive than having devotions with him

in other words faith in a 357 is far stronger than faith in a 
God providing a miracle for his followers Interesting Now if 
David Korresh was God why couldnt he use lightning instead of 
semiautomatic rifles It seems even he didnt trust in himself

Cheers
