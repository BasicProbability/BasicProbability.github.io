Subject Re Whos next Mormons and Jews




Capser before you deceive everone into thinking that the latterday
saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just
believing in their religion perhaps you would like to tell us all what
happened in the Mountain Meadow Massacres and all the killings that were
done under the Blood Atonement Doctrine at the command of Brigham Young

Why dont you tell us Tony  Im sure what you THINK you know adds up to a
lot more than what Casper has

Doesnt it frustrate you to consider how many intelligent thoughtful 
people you have prepared for the Mormon missionaries with your rant  The
more you talk the better we look  Nothing makes the truth look better
than a background of falsehood

Sic em Tony
