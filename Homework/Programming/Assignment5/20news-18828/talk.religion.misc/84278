in other words faith in a 357 is far stronger than faith in a 
God providing a miracle for his followers Interesting Now if 
David Korresh was God why couldnt he use lightning instead of 
semiautomatic rifles It seems even he didnt trust in himself

In the hands of a defender a 357 is a miracle from God  He helps those 
who help themselves  Or havent you ever heard that one before
