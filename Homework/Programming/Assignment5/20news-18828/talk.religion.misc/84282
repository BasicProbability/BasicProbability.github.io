 Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus  I realize it is normally tossed
 out because it contains miracles but what are the other reasons
 
  It is not tossed out as a source but would it be regarded as
 unbiased and independant 
 
 This brings up another something I have never understood  I asked this once
 before and got a few interesting responses but somehow didnt seem satisfied
 Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source

Contradicting itself on facts for example
