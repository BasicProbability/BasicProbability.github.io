 The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi formerly of
 Oregon are historical evidence  
 
 Are you confusing Bhagwan Rajneesh sp with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
 here by any chance  I think Bhagwan was in Oregon with all the Rolls
 Royces  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi founded Transcendental Meditation and
 does the yogic flying stuff  Bhagwans group was a communal free sex
 kind of thing  I think they both had beards though

I think we should just let Bhagwans be Bhagwans
