 Well Stephens annotated study of David Koreshs sermon
 doesnt bother me  Its probable that a careful review of
 what Stephen has done with obvious expenditure of thoughtful
 effort would provide additional insight into David and his love
 for God May his soul rest in peace   And whether or
 not we agree with various points of theology therein a review
 would likely provide significant insight into our own love
 for God  One thing that seems apparent from even a cursory
 reading of Koreshs message is that he was not the looney
 tunes portrayed in the FBI filtered press reports on him
 but was quite possibly the friendly likeable person his
 attorney reported him to be

Someone stated that the Davidian cult should not be associated
with Christianity Well I read all those four postings and Im
now even more convinced that Davididians are truly Christian
in nature But sometimes it makes sense to relabel the cult 
especially if the ugliness is too much to handle

Cheers
