          An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found 
        in the rubble had bullet wounds  The local coroner who is 
        independent of the FBI has so far found no bullet wounds 

According to CNN last night Saturday 42493 he has now found bullets
in two of the corpses in the head that would indicate that the bullets
were aimed at killing the humans

	This will not of course deter the several diehard Koreshies on
this net who will probably claim that the Tarrant County medical examiner
Dr Peerwani was coerced by the FBI into faking this evidence  Either that
or theyll claim the FBI shot them
	The rest of us might contemplate the difficulty of determining the
cause of death from a corpse that has been reduced to a Krispy Kritter
