   So what is Kibology Chopped liver
 Kibo Himself summed it up by saying Kibology is not just a religion it is
 also a candy mint  and a floor wax I personally think that it is more
 like Spam Clear
    

Im presently searching for enlightenment answers to the unanswerable
a certain amount of direction without actually going anywhere
Could Kibology be it  I dont know enough about Kibology and wish that
someone can help me
After Ive spread my ninth tube of anchovy paste on my living room
wall to creat my own form of art I need some higher authority to 
turn towards to give my life some meaning  Maybe Kibology is the
answer  Its either that or I go out to the store and buy up another
case of anchovy paste
