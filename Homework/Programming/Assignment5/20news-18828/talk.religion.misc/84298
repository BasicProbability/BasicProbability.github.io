Kent with regards to the information contained in the Bible which
is the original context of this thread Brian Kendig is inside a huge
wall  Brian IS inside  The Bible and the information contained therein
are outside the wall

Um I think you and the Bible are the ones inside the wall  Theres a
really wonderful world out here  You really should peek out at it sometime

The silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we are
on opposite sides of a very high wall  I see how incredibly beautiful
things are on my side and I only keep telling you about it because
Id like to you come join me here

Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the
absurd things he says  For example If I get through into the firey
pit I will cease to exist

I never said that  I said that I would PREFER to cease to exist than
to be tossed into any gods version of Hell

I am proposing to Brian Brian come up here
and take a look from this vantage point   But Brian replies I rather
not thank you  I am content where I am  Besides the vista from up
there stinks   And in the meanwhile Brian ignores the facts that
he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same
plateau where Brian now stands

You say to me Brian come up here and take a look from this vantage
point  But youre in a valley looking at a crayon drawing of a sun
and a tree and I cant for the life of me figure out why youre so
immersed in it  Im the one trying to get you to come up HERE
dont you see

                            netre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent
    The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre
     is that it ends                                            Rousseau
