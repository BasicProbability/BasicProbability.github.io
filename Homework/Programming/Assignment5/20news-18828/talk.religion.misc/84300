	Im not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so
neatly or at all  A myth is more than a single story  The thought 
structure and worldparadigm in which that story is interpreted is as
important a part of the myth as the story itself  Thus I can think of
no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person
to another within a single culture which wont rest upon that underlying
thought structure and thus transmit some of that cultures mythical
truths along with it
