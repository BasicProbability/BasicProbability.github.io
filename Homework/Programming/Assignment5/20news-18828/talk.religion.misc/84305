 Bottom line due process was not served  No peaceful attempt to serve
 a warrant occurred
 
 The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant was met with gunfire Due process
 was not served because the Branch Davidians wanted it that way
 
 You think on that

I am not exactly known as a Flower Child Pacifist but lets call
cowpoop cowpoop

The peaceful attempt to serve the warrant consisted of the following
actions in order

1 BATF agents forcing their entry of the compound through second
story windows

2 BATF agents loosing some grenades allegedly stun or flash
grenades which promptly detonated

After which according to the tapes I have seen the BD
started shooting back

Now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property
and tossing grenades around is considered peaceful by
anyone You think on that

Which is not to say I do not still hold my previous and
entirely correct notions about what should be worn and
what arms should be used in assaulting a building
