Frank unless you didnt realize it you are just now involved
in a debate where we have various opinions and each entity
has its own frame where the opinion is expressed I think I 
dont need to state the dreadful rword

So its sometimes correct to say that morality is objective or what

If you were able to prove that morality is objective then it would
be correct to do so The problem is by the very meaning of the
words in question to do so is oxymoronic Of course you could
redefine the words but that would still not lend support to the
underlying concept

After all I could hardly be wrong without dragging in the oword

This does not parse How could you hardly be wrong without dragging
in the oword

For your part when you say that relativism is true thats just
your opinion  Why do folk get so heated then if a belief in relativism
is merely a matter of taste  to be fair you have been very calm
I get the impression thats because you dont care about notions of
objectivity in any flavour  Right

I have no problem with objectivity at all It is my objectivity that
has led me to conclude that morality is subjective
