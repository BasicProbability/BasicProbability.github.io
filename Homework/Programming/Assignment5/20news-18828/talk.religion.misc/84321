 Hmm it seems that this is the core of Christianity then you 
 have to feel guilty and then theres this single personality
 that will save you from this universal guilt feeling
 
 Brian I will tell you a secret I dont feel guilty at all
 I do mistakes and I regret them however Ive never had this
 huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder

I will tell you another secret  I get this burning sensation in my
hand every time I hold it over a candle  The pain does not fill my entire
body and Im told the longer I hold it here the less itll hurt itll
eventually burn up the nerves or so Im told  So I suppose I should just
ignore the pain because holding my hand over the candle is something I just
want to do Ive got the right dont I

Your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong  Its your bodys
alarm system informing you that something needs your attention

A fever tells you that you are sick and need some sort of care

Guilt can be seen as that emotional or spiritual alarm just informing you
that there is something that youve done that requires your attention

It doesnt require a personality type to become a believer  It requires
someone who is willing to listen to themselves their body  soul  

 All I know is that I dont know everything And frankly speaking
 I dont care life is fun anyway I recognize that Im not 
 perfect but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
 and inspiring life

For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping cid LSD
Frankly speaking I didnt really care  It was fun anyway

It didnt matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a 
tremendously greater risk of serious birth defects

For several years all I knew is I really liked having sex with as many women
as I could convice  Frankly speaking I didnt care  

I didnt care that I was putting each one of them at risk as well as their
future partners

It didnt matter that for the first decade of my marriage my wife and I
will have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something much
worse than a cold

 
 There are humans that subscribe to the same notion The nice
 thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden
 the shoulders feel far more relaxed

The nice thing about pain killers if you take enough you wont care about 
the fever shortness of breath or pain
