       Since you have referred to the Messiah I assume you are referring
        to the New Testament  Please detail your complaints or email if
        you dont want to post  Firstcentury Greek is wellknown and
        wellunderstood  Have you considered Josephus the Jewish Historian
        who also wrote of Jesus  In addition the four gospel accounts
        are very much in harmony

 
Since this drivel is also crossposted to altatheism how about reading
the altatheism FAQ The Josephus quote is concidered to be a fake even
by Christian historians and the four gospels contradict each other in
important points
 
Werent you going to offer a scientific theory of Creationism
