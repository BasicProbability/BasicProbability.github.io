culled from a discussion on Christianity and objective morals

Question  Is there any effective difference between

Objective values exist and there is disagreement over what they are

and

Values are subjective

I dont see any




Is there any difference in saying 

Absolute Truth exists but some people think its a lie

and

Truth is relative 

I think there is  in both examples the first statement is a
fundamental disagreement between at least two people the 
second statement is agreed upon by all

To put it another way someone who says objective values exist
does not agree that values are subjective
