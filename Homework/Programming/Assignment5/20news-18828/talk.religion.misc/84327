Really  You dont know what objective value is  If I offered the people
of the US collectively 1 for all of the land in America would that 
sound like a good deal  

That happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
US would happen to agree on  Continue to move the price up 
at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
probably all would accept at a high enough number

Endpoints of a subjective scale are not the given homes of 
objective viewpoints
