Yeah  In a fire that reportedly burned hotter than 1000 degrees hot
enough to make the bodies still unidentifiable the authorities found
a gun that was recognizably fullyautomatic and state of the art
Isnt that CONVEEEENIENT

Convenient  It seems very appropriate that this is crossposted to
altconspiracy

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your 1000 degree
measurement that the temperature is in Centigrade rather than the
more common in the US Fahrenheit you are still laboring under at
least 2 misconceptions

1  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C
    Actually the melting point of most iron alloys and steels are
    iron alloys is in the neighborhood of 1400 C  Even if the gun
    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature the steel
    parts of the gun would not be deformed and it would still be
    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon

2  A fire is not an isothermal process  There are hot spots and
    cold spots though cold is purely a relative term   So the
    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot as you seem to
    imply  And even if it was so what  It would not have melted
    anyway
