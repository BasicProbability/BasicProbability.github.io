Mr Clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the Waco fiasco
should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so
Now I began scratching my head thinking a bad sign  dont the 
mainstream religions in this case Christianityor the 7th day 
adventist in particular just keep these guys going  Isnt Mr Clinton 
condemning his own religion  After all isnt it a cult too 

 bad thoughts these

  well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of
cult and say all faiths are cults or if you take a more socialcontext
view of cult which allows you to recognize mainstream religions as 
sociallyacceptable and cults as groups that involve techniques of brain
washing and all the other characteristics that define oppressive probly not
the best word cult behaviour

My understanding of the academic use of the word cult is that it is
a group of people oriented around a single authority figure It need
not be religious However I have seen plenty of religious cults
including some that mainstream
