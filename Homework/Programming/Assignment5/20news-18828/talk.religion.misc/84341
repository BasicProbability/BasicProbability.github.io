  Theres no objective physics Einstein and Bohr have told us that
 
 Speaking as one who knows relativity and quantum mechanics I say 
 Bullshit
 
Speaking as someone who also knows relativity and quantum mechanics I say
Go ahead punk make my day  My degree can beat up your degree
 
 OK refer us to the place in Einsteins or Bohrs writings where
 he said theres no objective physics

Ah you taking everything as literal quotation  No wonder youre confused

First can I ask that we decide on a definition of objective

Theres no objective reality  LSD should be sufficient to prove that
 
 Speaking as one who has taken LSD I say 
 Bullshit
 
Well Ill have to bow to your superior knowledge on that one but I think I
detect a pattern in your responses  How about some actual support for your
dismissals
 
 You take LSD and it skews your perception of reality You come down
 and your perceptions unskew

And

 How could striving toward an ideal be in any way useful if the ideal 
 had no objective existence
 
A perfectly efficient power station would convert all of the energy in coal
into electricity  There is absolutely no way we can build a perfect power
station its an ideal  But striving towards that ideal is undeniably
useful and valuable is it not
 
 OK let me narrow the question Is it useful to strive toward a
 nonexistent objective ethics

Id guess that it might be

 In what way

It may be the case that some people are unable to evaluate complex moral
issues  Rather than leaving them to behave immorally it might be better
to offer them an abstract nonexistent objective system of ethics which they
can strive towards coded into rules which they dont have to derive for
themselves

I tend to feel that this is pretty much what we all have as morality
anyway
