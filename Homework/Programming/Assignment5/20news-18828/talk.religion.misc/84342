 Got it in one  Similarly a moral relativist will not judge one moral syste
 to be better than another in every possible circumstance  This does not
 however preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than anothe
 in a specific set of circumstances  Nor does it preclude a set of moral
 relativists from collectively judging a moral system from some set of
 circumstances which they all agree they are in
 
 OK this makes sense to me  Im serious youve explained something
 to me which I never understood before  But just for grins suppose we
 almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality
 What then

Then we all live happily ever after 

Seriously if we all agreed on the circumstances were in I suspect wed all
agree on the best course of action  Unfortunately I have no confidence that
such a situation will ever arise 

Some of us think theres a big God in the sky some dont  Some think
theyve been chosen by God others disagree  Some think they are infallible
others think otherwise  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be
ironed out theres little hope of everyone agreeing

     Or say for all practical intents and purposes there is no frame
 of reference in which thus and such is good isnt that approximately
 objective in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to
 outrun a snail

Yes  I think that for example only a vanishingly small number of people
would hold that theres a frame of reference in which gassing six million
Jews is good  So thats probably about as close to an objective moral value
as Ive encountered in my life so far

                       For example if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area
 isnt it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act even
 though there conceivably might be some tailend case that would justify it

Well I think your examples poor  If the bombs in Iraq for example and
was dropped by an American plane many people would hold that it was a moral
act

   And what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference if
   it isnt an objective reality for values
  
  Im sorry I cant parse an objective reality for values  Could you tr
 y
  again
  
  san objective reality for valuessome values are real even in the face
  of disagreement
 
 I still dont quite see what youre trying to say  I assume by values you
 mean moral values yes  In which case what do you mean by real  What is
 a real moral value as opposed to an unreal one
 
 I mean to say that values are as real as horses whatever you understand
 by a horse being real is pretty much what I mean about a value being real

Hmm  So these moral values have a perceptible physical presence

  If you are saying that some moral systems are better than others in
  your opinion then all you get is infinite regress
 
 Sorry but in what way is it an infinite regress  It looks extremely finite
 to me
 
 I meant that its never more than your opinion

Right and the chain ends right there  The buck stops with me  Its not an
infinite regress

                                                       Youve clarified this
 for me above  My understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists
 agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference
 then theyre saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes
 no different than what Im saying

Right  The key point however is that there are vanishingly few of these
moral issues where we can get 999 of people to agree on the outcome for all
frames of reference and agree on the frames of reference

                                                     What you do not get
  is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
  is inferior to that of the man of peace
 
 Sorry but thats not so  I can provide a justification for asserting that
 the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace  
 I just cant provide a justification which works in all possible
 circumstances
 
 Logically possible or actually possible

I cant manage either  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a
terrorist act but I have to admit that I couldnt exactly condemn it 
Although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight

                                              By which I mean are you
 stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal
 switching places so that the terminal turns upside down or do you
 think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is
 superior to peace

I think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have
been better than peace  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people
killed  Assuming it was successful terrorism of course
