Omigod its an operationalist Sorry Jim but the idea that a theory
explaining a myriad of distinctly different observations is merely a
model is more than sensible people can accept  your phobia about
objective reality notwithstanding

First of all I have no phobia of objective reality  Im simply
saying that the scientific model of the atom is probably not 
what is really out there  Im not saying that theres no object
that sources these properties we measure from atomic theory

You hadnt made that clear Im glad to have it clarified So youre
a physical objectivist after all right

Take light as another example  There are two theories particle and
wave  Each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point
So which is it particle or wave  You tell me  Youre the sensible
one
