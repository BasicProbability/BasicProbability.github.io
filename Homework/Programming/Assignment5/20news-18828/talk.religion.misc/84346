Simply put evolutioncreation when each is looked at properly  theoryfact
vs assertionfiction  is a specific example of exactly what separates reason
and science from nonsense

   Although I agree that creation is nonsense I submit that you are making
the same mistake that creationists commonly do  In this and previous posts
I think you have been engaging in the fallacy of false dichotomy you have
consistently characterized sciencereligion as rationalismnonsense when
in fact the latter do not form a complete set of options  Neither do the
former for that matter

   I wish that the semiexplicit linking of evolution to socalled rational
atheism could be avoided it just gives the creationists fuel for their
oftenrepeated incantation that evolution leads to atheism

No Dave and as an anthropologist I take great umbrage with this 
misrepresentation  I sense that it is you that has made the jump from creation
science to religion see above  I have characterized sciencecreation 
science as rationalismnonsense and that it is  When people promote their 
religious beliefs as science they become nonsense  Kept where they belong 
they are meaningful and useful as virtually any anthropologists will tell you
and as I have said several times in this group  And it works the other way 
too and I have repeatedly said so  Never have I said or meant anything 
different here or elsewhere and I dont think my communication skills betray
me  Nor do I presume to offend peoples spiritual sensibilities as
I would hope others would not disparage mine
