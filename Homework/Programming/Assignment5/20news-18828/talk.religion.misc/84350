Go ahead punk make my day  My degree can beat up your degree

Simple  Take out some physics books and start looking for statements which
say that there is no objective physics  I doubt you will find any  You might
find statements that there is no objective length or no objective location
but no objective physics  Consider for instance that speedoflightin
vacuum is invariant  This sounds an awful lot like an objective
speedoflightinvacuum

Or you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor  If you take
a look at Quantum Mechanics many objective observations can be made
as well  However Physics is not objective  Bohr said the randomness
of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself  Einstein said that 
nature is deterministic it is our method of observation that inserts the
randomness  They were talking about the exact same results

But neither of them claimed to have experimental evidence that proved 
them right In a similar vein there is as yet no experimental evidence
for supersymmetric particles so some physicists believe in them and
some dont  but all agree that either there is an objectively true
answer to the question

Depends on how you look at it I guess
