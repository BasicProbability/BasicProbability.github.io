Subject Re What RIGHT 
From Casper C Knies ISSCCKBYUVMBITNET

Recently Ive asked myself a rather interesting question What RIGHT does
god have on our lives always assuming there is a god of course 

In his infinite wisdom he made it perfectly clear that if we dont live
according to his rules we will burn in hell Well with what RIGHT can god
make that desicion Lets say for the sake of argument that god creates
every one of us directly or indirectly it doesnt matter What then
happens is that he first creates us and then turns us lose Well I didnt
ask to be created

Lets make an analogue If a scientist creates a unique living creature
which has happened it was even patented does he then have the
right to expect it to behave in a certain matter or die

Dear Joakim let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions
but that by asking you will find as many different explanations as there
are respondents  As a Latterday Saint I believe that all of us you
me etc lived once as spiritchildren of God the Father Hebrews 129
in the premortal existance In order to continue our eternal progression
an earthly probationary time was required  To live by faith not by
sight to choose good over evil and to prepare ourselves in all things
to become worthy of a higher order of existance  We believe that all of
Gods spiritoffspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of
this earthly sojourn  Onethird chose for Lucifers plan most followed
the Firstborn the premortal Jesus Christ  Lucifers aspirations I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God    Isaiah 141217 etc
resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and
those who followed Him resulting in the casting out of Lucifer who
became Satan the father of lies and onethird of the hosts of heaven
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast
them to the earth    Revelation 124 as demons evil spirits

To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth and to be subject to
God and His plan for good or bad based upon our obedience and choices
we made that choice individually  God speaking to Job Where wast thou
when I laid the foundations of the earth    when the morning stars
sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy Job 3847  We
lost the knowledge of our premortal existance the Veil of Forgetful
ness somewhere in Psalms in order to live by faith not by sight

You may not accept this scenario neither do quite a few who rely on the
Bible alone which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular
aspect of our existence as individuals as sons and daughters of God

Who is god to impose its rules on us  Who can tell if god is REALLY so
righteous as god likes us to believe Are all christians a flock of sheep
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest

Hmmmmmmmmmmmm

All Christians by definition ARE a flock of sheep following the Shepherd
as they understand Him    But in any event not all Christians believe
in the same theology such as the one Latterday Saints believe in  They
will cry heresy and other accusations of perverting the doctrines of
the Bible while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations as
found in their catechisms and various doityourself Biblestudy manuals

As for me I have a personal conviction that the preexistance scenario as
explained above is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine some Dead Sea
Scroll books the pseudographion other Jewish sources and last but not
least modernday revelation on the subject

I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm I mean it

                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that
                        he is acting according to Gods will and who there
     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by
                        stabbing you in the back

                                                        Voltaire
