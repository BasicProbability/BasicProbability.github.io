For several years all I knew is I really liked dropping cid LSD
Frankly speaking I didnt really care  It was fun anyway

It didnt matter that every child my wife and I want to have are at a 
tremendously greater risk of serious birth defects

Does it matter that the study yes singular that showed LSD causing
birth defects also holds true for aspirin  Does it matter that
this study is flatout wrong and LSD does not give you a greater
risk of having children with birth defects
