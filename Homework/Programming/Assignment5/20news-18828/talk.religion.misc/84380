Subject Re Is it good that Jesus died

Brian Kendig first states

 I am my own master

I ask

 Are you truly the master of yourself

Brian Kendig states

 Not yet   

Make up your mind 

     but my life is the ground I use to practice on  The fun is
 in the getting there We dont start out perfect    

And we do not end perfect either  We are never perfect  Can you name
one person young or old past or present that you deem perfect 
Good luck

 I know my shortcomings and I know my strengths and I live
 my life according to the decisions I make and I am content to abide
 with the consequences of my decisions as easily as Ill accept the
 praise for them  There have been times in my life when Ive made
 mistakes yes I try to never make the same mistake twice

Then you lie to yourself  You do not know your shortcomings  I have clearly
shown one of your shortcomings if not two  That is ignorance of the Bible
and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its 
contents

 I regard Christ as a myth 

Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself
And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion I bet you do not
even know what the word Christ means  Or which prophet used Christ to 
describe the Son of Man 

 I feel that there are far too many people
 offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
 did  The only person who can really judge me is me

Yes  I agree with that  So we must learn first  Read the Bible  Come
up with our own interpretation   Evaluate what is being said
and by whom  Check the history books as well  Compare someone elses
interpretation with your own  Then make a judgment  But I tell you the
truth 99 of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as 
much as a coffee cup needs interpretation

And remember the Bible isnt a Gurus Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics  
It doesnt take a theologian to understand what is being said    The 
Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed 
to people like you and I  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard  Is it 
their open diaryand they want to tell you something  And because they
want you to know something they make it very clear what they want you to
know   They didnt encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric but in simple
straightforward language

 I choose the
 roads I travel and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of
 any given road or turn back  and as long as I dont always turn
 back theres no shame in it  When I need help I seek out my friends

You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible  You have chosen the
road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that
road doesnt look appealing to you  You rather build your own road  One
that goes far away from that confrontation   But be assured of this
you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly 

And you dont have a clue about what Im saying either  Open your
eyes and SEE open your ears and LISTEN  Im not just spouting off
empty words  This is my LIFE this is what gives me MEANING

I see what you mean  I hear what your saying  I am not degrading your
life  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years  There is nothing 
new in what you are saying  And by your own words you are spouting off 
contradictions   If contradictions give you meaning then your life must
be sad

 I say my mother loves me  How do I know you ask  I can point to
 definite things shes done for me and I can even just bring her to
 you so you can ask her facetoface
 You say your deity loves you  How do you know I ask 

Bingo  For God so loved the world he GAVE his only begotton to son
so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life   I look
what God did  He has given his Son even to his death so that I can have 
hope in his resurrection and know that life isnt for nothing but has
glorious purpose

 You cant even convince me that it exists 

Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history  You choose to
lie to yourself that he doesnt exist for you ignore what has been said for 
thousands of years  You sound exactly almost verbatim like the Lazarus of 
Jesuss story starting in Luke 1619  And the conclusion of that story is a 
bleak one  Lazarus wound up in hell  The story ends like this

      For if Lazarus doesnt even listen to Moses and the Prophets
       he wont even believe if a man rose from the dead

 If any god dangles heaven before me like a carrot promising untold
 pleasures to me if Ill only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
 rationality for just this once then I would choose hell  I can
 not lie to myself to placate another being no matter how powerful
 it is

Arrogance at its best   The fact is you are not rational  Several specific
cases  have already been cited   And again with this new statement you show more irrationality with regards to heaven  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect
in heaven  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him  Jesus does
not expect you to placate either  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him but not
as his grovelling slave but rather as his brother who will share in his
glorious riches  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself  
You maintain you have an open mind  See whether you are lying to yourself for
yourself

Why would you want to live a good life
To you you die and thats it  Dont contradict yourself  You have
no reason to live a good life  It doesnt do you any good in the
end  Your life doesnt do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway  So you have no reason to lead a good life Leading
a good life is meaningless   Why do you do such a meaningless thing

That paragraph demonstrates that you havent listened to a single word
Ive said

I do understand what you said   But thats is not what I feel went amiss here

You missed the point  Living a good life has no eternal consequences
Once they close the amusement park of life to you that is the end  To you it 
is over  To you therefore your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless 
It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth 

But then you contradict yourself  From a previous post you said doing evil things 
is bad  To you it shouldnt matter if you do evil things or good things  It is
all meaningless in the end anyway  So go rob a bank  Go tell someone
you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag  Whats restraining you
Life after all has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant

 In the same way I think life is fun  And I dont intend to leave the
 amusement park of life until they close down for the night  D

At which time you are truly not the master of yourself

Im sorry I dont feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
Id worship would do unless the sacrifice was only temporary in
which case its not really all that important

Has the resurrection sunk in  Jesus is alive  Jesus is NOT dead

So you and your holy book say  By the same token therefore Santa
Claus delivers toys every xmas  Dont you see  I have NO REASON to
believe that what you say is true  Please give me some reason that I
cant similarly apply to Santa Claus

You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses
of Jesus say are true  But you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the
reasons  By definition ignorance 

Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves
and flying reindeer   Ever see a flying reindeer  Has anyone in human
history seen a flying reindeer  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose 
blinks red    

On the other hand are people born in Bethlehem  Was Nebuchandezzar really
a king  Was Daniel really one of his court officials  Were David and Solomon
really kings of Israel and Judah  Was their really a king called Jehoachin
Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ  Did
Sennacherib really lose his battleand badly   Was there really a 
Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus   Yes yes yes    history verifies
it  It is NONFICTION

Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction  Perhaps you
cant evaluate the context of Grimms Fairy Tales apart from
that of the Scientific American  I suppose you treat both with equal
truthfulness or equal falsity  Is this what you are telling me  Or
is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out
that its not a fairy tale

Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book and cannot be supported without
invoking them

Get real  Have you ever been to Zaire  Do you have to go there
to be  assured that there really is such a place  Given your 
irrationality I take it you have never used a map in your life

 Why do you believe what you believe

Given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living
God Id be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if I didnt follow Jesus
