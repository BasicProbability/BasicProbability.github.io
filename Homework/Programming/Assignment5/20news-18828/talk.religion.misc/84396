From sandviknewtonapplecom Kent Sandvik
Subject OTO clarification

Sorry the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called AMORC 
I dont remember for the time being what the AM stand for
but ORC is Ordo Rosae Crucis in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross Sigh seems lm loosing more and more
of my long term memory

Otherwise their headquarters in San Jose has a pretty decent
metaphysical bookstore if any of you are interested in such books
And my son loves to run around in their Egyptian museum

Cheers
Kent
