Subject Re socmotss et al Princeton axes matching funds for Boy Scouts

In article N4HY93Apr5120934harderccrpidaorg n4hyharderccrpidaorg Bob McGwier writes

 1 HOWEVER I hate economic terrorism and political correctness
 worse than I hate this policy  


 2 A more effective approach is to stop donating
 to ANY organizating that directly or indirectly supports gay rights issues
 until they end the boycott on funding of scouts  

Can somebody reconcile the apparent contradiction between 1 and 2
