The motto originated in the StarSpangled Banner  Tell me that this has
something to do with atheists
The motto oncoins originated as a McCarthyite smear which equated atheism
with Communism and called both unamerican

No it didnt  The motto has been on various coins since the Civil War
It was just required to be on all currency in the 50s
