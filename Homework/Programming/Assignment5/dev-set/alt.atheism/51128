To borrow from philosophy you dont truly understand the color red
until you have seen it
Not true even if you have experienced the color red you still might
have a different interpretation of it

But you wouldnt know what red was and you certainly couldnt judge
it subjectively  And objectivity is not applicable since you are wanting
to discuss the merits of red
