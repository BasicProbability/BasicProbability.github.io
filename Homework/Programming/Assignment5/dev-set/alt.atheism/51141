 If this god is truly omnipotent as you folks like to claim then why cant
 he terminate eternity

For the same reason he cant flibble glop ork groink

The thing you are demanding that he must be able to do has no meaning in its
own terms

This is a classic example of excessive faith in reason  The fact that we
have trouble talking about something doesnt imply that it is impossible it
simply implies that it is hard to talk about  There is a very good chance
that God can flibble glop ork groink  Charlie Wingate can flibble glop
ork groink and he isnt even God
