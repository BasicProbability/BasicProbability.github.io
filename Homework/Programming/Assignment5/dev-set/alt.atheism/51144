In article 199304041750AA17104keplerunhedu dmnkeplerunhedu until kings become philosophers or philosophers become kings writes



     Recently RAs have been ordered and none have resisted or cared about
it apparently to post a religious flyer entitled The Soul Scroll Thoughts
on religion spirituality and matters of the soul on the inside of bathroom
stall doors at my school the University of New Hampshire It is some sort
of newsletter assembled by a Hall Director somewhere on campus
most of post deleted

  Please respond as soon as possible Id like these religious postings to
stop NOW 

  
Thanks

  Dana

       
        
There is an easy way out
Post the flyers on the stall doors but add at the bottom in nice large
capitals
