 My claim is that a person that committs a crime doesnt believe in 
 God for the moment that the crime is committed at least whether 
 they are originally believers or not  To believe is to do good  
 Your statistics indicate people that have declared atheism

And doubtless when an atheist does an act of charity
they temporarily become a Baptist
