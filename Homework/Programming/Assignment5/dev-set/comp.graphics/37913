Subject graphical representation of vectorvalued functions

gnuplot etc make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables
but I want to plot functions whose values are 2vectors I have been 
doing this by plotting arrays of arrows complete with arrowheads but
before going further I thought I would ask whether someone has already
done the work Any pointers

thanx in advance
