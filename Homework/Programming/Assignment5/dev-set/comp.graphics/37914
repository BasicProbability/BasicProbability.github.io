Can someone please tell me where I can ftp DTA or DMORPH

DMorf Daves Morph I think is what it means and DTax Daves 
TGA Assembler are available in the MSDOSUPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions
dmorfxexe and dtaxexe you can also find a version of aaplayexe
there with which you can view files you create with dtaexe or
dtaxexe

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely notreadytospreadtothemasses but they are very
well written 

The interface is frustrating at first but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option  Not sure why since I dont have
the source  I think it was written for TP 60

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right tell me it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then 
it would work
