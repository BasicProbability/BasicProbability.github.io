Subject   VOICE INPUT  vendor information needed


Hello
     I am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface I am
developing on an HP730 UNIX workstation  I would greatly appreciate 
information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are 
easily accessible from the UNIX environment 

     The names or adresses of applicable vendors as well as any 
experiences you have had with specific systems would be very helpful

     Please respond via email I will post a summary if there is 
sufficient interest


Thanks
Ken


PS  I have found several impressive systems for IBM PCs but I would 
like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate PC if 
at all possible
