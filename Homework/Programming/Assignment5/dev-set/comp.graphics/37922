    I think youre proposal would work to get an extra one maybe two extra
bits of color resolution  However if you had a display that chould do only
zero or full intensity for each primary I dont think youd get great
equivalent 24bit photographs

I have not suggested to do so I wrote about problems and the problem
were clearly visible with 7 bit bw images not to mention 24 bit images

 description of experiment deleted 

If the 1 bit images are viewed quickly and in sync with screen
then 100 intensities could be better than we have  I dunno

In any case getting black color with slow machines is problem
I could try it on our 8 bit screens but I dont know how to
render pixels with X in constant time I recall our double buffer
has other image color and one bw  that doesnt help either
Maybe I should dump photos to screen with low level code how

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 greylevel photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well giving respectable
contrast The quality of the images was pretty good There were no
visible contrast bands

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255 the second only for pixels that had value 254
etc These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to or onto the screen in sequence Creating these
frames sometimes took 510 minutes on that old Mac but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway And yes we wrote
directly to the screen memory Mea culpa

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print Whod have guessed
