Subject Re More gray levels out of the screen

In article C51C4rBtGcscticom rowlandshcticom Jon Rowlands writes

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 greylevel photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds

Why didnt you create 8 greylevel images and display them for
1248163264128 time slices

This requires the same total exposure time and the same precision in
timing but drastically reduces the imagepreparation time no
