Subject Any graphics packages available for AIX 


	Does anybody know if there are any good 2dgraphics packages
	available for IBM RS6000  AIX  Im looking for something
	like DECs GKS or HewlettPackards Starbase both of which
	have reasonably good support for different output devices
	like plotters terminals X etc

	I have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and IBMs implementation
	of Phigs Both of them work but we require more output devices
	than just Xwindows

	Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics and
	I am not expecting for any good solutions from there
