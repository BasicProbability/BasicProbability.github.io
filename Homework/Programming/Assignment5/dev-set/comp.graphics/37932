Why didnt you create 8 greylevel images and display them for
1248163264128 time slices

By 8 grey level images you mean 8 items of 1bit images
It does work but it doesnt work if you have more than 1bit
in your screen and if the screen intensity is nonlinear

With 2 bit per pixel there could be 1c1  4c2 timing
this gives 16 levels but they are linear if screen intensity is
linear
With 1c1  2c2 it works but we have to find the best
compinations  theres 10 levels but 16 choises best 10 must be
chosen Different compinations for the same level varies a bit but
the levels keeps their order

Readers should verify what I wrote
