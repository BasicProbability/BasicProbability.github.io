 Hi
 
 I will be writing a data acquisition program to collect data from a
 variety of sources including RS232 and external ADs and I would
 like to be able to display the data in near realtime  Ive done this
 type of thing on PCs and other machines but I am unaware of any graphics
 package that could help me with this on a UNIX machine
 
 
 
 Does anyone have any ideas on commercial or free packages that might
 suit my needs  I would really appreciate any input  Im sure this has
 been done many times before
 

  For a commerical package try WAVE from  Precision Visuals
                                           5055306563

  For a free package try KHOROS from University of New Mexico
                                      5082776563
                                   ftp from
                              ptrgeeceunmedu

    Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password
               cd pubkhorosrelease

   That will get you to the right place

                                                         David
