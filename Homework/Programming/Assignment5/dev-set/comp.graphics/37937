Subject RE VESA on the Speedstar 24

kjbMGLuvesa32zip

This is a universal VESA driver  It supports most video
boardschipsets include the Speedstar24 and 24X up to
24 bit color

Terry

PS  Ive tried it on a Speedstar24 and 24X and it works 

Not with all software  For instance it doesnt work at all with
Animator Pro from Autodesk It cant detect ANY SVGA modes when 
running UniVESA This is really a problem as we need a VESA driver
for both AA Pro and some hicolor stuff 

Just out of curiosity Are you using the latest version 32  Versions
previous to this did not fill in all of the capabilities bits and other
information correctly  I had problems with a lot of software until I got
this version  I dont think the author got around to posting an 
announcementof it or at least I missed it but 32 was available in the 
directory indicated as of 329

I sure did use version 32 It works fine with most software but NOT
with Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me Pretty
useless program without that thing working IMHO
So I hope the author can fix that

Daniel
