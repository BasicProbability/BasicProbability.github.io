From jiu1husc11harvardedu Haibin Jiu

Hi  I am in immediate need for details of various graphics compression
techniques  So if you know where I could obtain descriptions of algo
rithms or publicdomain source codes for such formats as JPEG GIF and
fractals I would be immensely grateful if you could share the info with
me  This is for a project I am contemplating of doing

Thanks in advance  Please reply via email if possible
