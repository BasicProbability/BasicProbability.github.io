Now does anyone know a way to back up the masters of WordPerfect 51 for
Windows Windows 31 and Norton 60 so I can send another copy to my
permanent noncollege address for safekeeping  Students keep borrowing
my masters and Im worried theyll get screwed up  Please dont tell me

You realize of course that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than SMCAPBOLDFontGod
999ptThe Lawsmcapboldfont

But thats irrelevant to the problem here  Windows came with my
system but on 525 disks  I hate using 525 disks so I copied
them over to high density 35s using xcopy  It worked fine  In
fact for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you
can simply copy them all into one directory  Makes it a lot nicer
when youre switching printer emulations around

Norton 60 I dont have much experience with but when a friends
system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals and it worked fine  This would imply that arj a r norton
cnu would create a workable backup and if you did a full install
the first time youve got the whole thing

Never played with WP for Windows Im not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah

Good luck
