        Heres another one

        5  My computer arrived with the following statement in its
            configsys file  STACKS  9256  I changed it to
            STACKS  8128 and saved 1296 bytes  Maybe it could be
            lowered even more but I havent tried it 

Exactly

Regardless of what Microsoft says I have set STACKS00 on every single
computer I have installed Windows on from a simple 386SX16 up to 486DX50
with EISA motherboards NDI Volante TIGA adapters Intel Ethernet Express
cards and caching SCSI controllers from DPT and DTC

Not a problem yet and the extra 2K gained means a lot with conventional
memory gobbling programs like OrCAD and Tango PCB

I remember reading somewhere QEMM manual I think that 
STACK9256 is needed only for the Windows SETUP program  
Otherwise use STACK00
