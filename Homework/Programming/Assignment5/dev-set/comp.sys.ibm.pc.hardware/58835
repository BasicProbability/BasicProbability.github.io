I have a gateway2000 48333 local bus system  It has 4 slots for SIMMS
that either have to use 4 or 16MB simms  My question  I just
received a 4x9 70ns simm and it has 30 pins  The slot on the
motherboard has at least 70 or so pins  Did I get the wrong simm
or can I still use my simm  although not all the pins on the slot would
be flilled  I have never encountered such a long slot for simms before
Anyone have suggestions  I cant get a hold of Gateway yet  Thanks
Please post to the net or    nshahacsbuedu

Yes You bought the WRONG SIMMSYou need 1X36 or 4X36 which are 72 pin
SIMMSThese are better anyway becuase the sendreceive data in 4byte
32bit4bit parity one for each byte Chunks You will undoubtedly see these
SIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future
