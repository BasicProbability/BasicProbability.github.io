Subject Another happy Gateway owner


   Since Ive been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways
lately on here I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences My
machine 4DX266V this past Friday This was two weeks to the DAY from
when I called the order in 

   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order All the 
peripherals I ordered were properly installed Jumbo250  CDROM I
was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway 
documentation All software came with the original disks and manuals
The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3ring binder The ATI GUP came
with build59 drivers All other software I specified Microsoft Office
was properly installed The machine came right up out of the box and 
has been performing flawlessly Its been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature I think the big roomy tower case has a 
lot to do with it 

   Its up and running DOS 60 with no problems Ive also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications 
I used the DOS 60 InterLink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at 1152K baud It then maps the other
machines two hard disks as my disks F  G You can cd to these
drives and either run programs or copy files Its almost like a
peerpeer lan except you can also run programs on the other machine
Its not a two way street The other machine is the server and this
machine is the client So thats where it seems to differ from the 
peer to peer stuff For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive 

  My Jumbo250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data I also
bypassed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the 430
credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG I love this monitor

  So Im glad there is some good news Gateway stories and Im glad it
was me Now if it just KEEPS working
