 I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with
 my Gateway 2000 48633DX VLBus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB  
 When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 everything is
 fine but whenever I use it in 800x600 Windows AutoCAD GIFs the screen 
 gets about 1 12 inches shorter  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
 there is about a 34 bar of black  The screen isnt cut off it just squeezes
 everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio  While I can
 manually change the VSize on the back this is a pain in the ass and it just
 shouldnt happen anyway  Ive called Gateway numerous times and they havent 
 been able to help me at all  Two different times they sent me a new card and
 both times the new card didnt work at all in my computer  They even tried
 to bill me for the first card because they didnt get it back in a couple of
 days when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
 before billing my card  But their customer support is a different story
 So if anyone has had this same problem please let me know if you know what
 to do  Hell let me know if you dont have a solution just so I know Im
 not the only one with this problem  Thanks in advance

 PS  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set
 ting up the card  Doesnt work  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size
 of the 800x600 screen it just starts to cut off the top and bottom
 

Maybe its a monitor problem  You mentioned that you swapped cards but not
monitors  Perhaps that could be it
