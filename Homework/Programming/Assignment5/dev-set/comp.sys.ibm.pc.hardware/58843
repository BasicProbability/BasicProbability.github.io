 So by going mailorder through Gateway I save 13  Plus I get
 technical support over the phone free software package
 
 Have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone  At least
 locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong and
 he has to fix it

Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms but not so
quick and not so competent from others Gateway included  But my experience
with computer retailers which is significant has lead to the conclusion that
sales personnel and retailtechnical personnel are forbidden to actually learn
about the products they sell  Talk about incompetent  OK so a few percent
of their answers are correct but those salesmen dont even realize how stupid
they are       OK  Ill settle down now   let me
catch my breath  

Fact retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product

Retail outlets are desirable however to those people who arent interested
in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions  This is fine
for example most of my education about carpeting wall paper lawn mowers
microwave ovens etc has come from sales personnel  I assume I must be an
idiot  But I dont care about those things  I do however care about my
computer  ie I demand features and performance and Ill be damned if Ill
pay some highschool drop out commission on an overrated overpriced system
and in the process be subjected to his distorted BS
