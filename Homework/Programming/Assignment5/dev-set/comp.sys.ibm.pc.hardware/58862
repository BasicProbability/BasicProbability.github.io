Subject Re DriveController Compatibility

Thanks to all who responded to my original post  I got the number for
Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the
BIOS to the Super BIOS  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read
write heads and up to 1024 cylinders  The upgrade is 15 payable by
check or money order  Send to

	Western Digital Corporation
	Technical Support Group
	PO Box 19665
	Irvine CA  927139665

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the
WD1002 series

The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives

The responses to my request for help follow my sig  Warning Its long

In article drice733866833ponder you write
I recently bought a used Seagate ST251 hard drive  The guy told me that
it had been fully tested and that it was good  I took it home to install
in my Compaq Portable OK Im a little behind in technology  I already
had an MFM controller

I installed the drive and powered up the system  I got a post error 1701

My controller is a Western Digital WD1002SWX2 Rev C
As I said above the drive is a Seagate ST251
The system is a Compaq Portable circa 1985

     Ah finally a question I can answer   I mess with this older
stuff alot   Kinda fun  8

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST251 will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom  

    Check the numbers on it  It should be the only nonsmt chip on
the board  Slightly below center and left    The bios should read 
either      62000042015 or
             620000940x2

     If the last 3 digits are 013 you got problems


Controller jumpers are set as follows  represents jumper
	W1	12 3
       W2      12 3
	W3	12
	W4	1 23
	W5	1 2 3
	W6	12 3
	W7	1 2 3

    Looks right   W5 and W7 are factory jumped with a trace between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address

The drive jumpers are as follows 8 represents jumper

    Looks right
  
art deleted

Here are my questions

1	Are the drive and controller compatible w each other

      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has   If you have
the 62000042015 rom set it like this

              5      open
              6      open             
              7      open        
              8      open
              4      closed
              3      closed
              2      open
              1      open

    Note   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block
Top to bottom   s represent the jumper pins    Pins 34 and 8
select the first drive setting drive 0 and pins 12 and 7 select the
second drive drive 1   

      If you have the 62000094 rom its a autoconfig and Ill have
to look up how to do it I dont have the big book right here

2	Are the jumpers on the carddrive set correctly

      See above  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not
right   Also  at the risk of being insulting make sure the cables
are on right and good 8    On the jumper on the 251 try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive    Its one or the other   
     The narrow data cable goes to J2   Ive thrown it on J3 a few
times and banged my head for a day

3	Is my systems BIOS in need of an upgrade

     Dunno    IBM roms had to be later than 102782   A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug   Enter
       
        d f000fff5 fffc    the  is the debug prompt
   
    This will return the rom date if its of any use

Keith Rice

      If I oversimplified any of the above I appologize     Its
just hard to know what caliber of person Im talking to 8

If you are using a TWISTED 34way cable then move the jumper 
on your drive to the neighbouring pins   8  Make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk and not a floppy disk  the
coloured stripe pin 1 should be furthest from the twist

This may also help

     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR SCSI HARD DISK DRIVES
     
          
          7000ASC  A SCSI host adapter that serves as an interface 
          between the AT bus and the SCSI bus  All necessary drivers and 
          receivers are included permitting direct cable connections to 
          the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus 
          through two edge connectors  The 7000ASC utilizes jumper  
          configurable options that enable the address space DMA channels 
          and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end users 
          application  The board also features word data transfer at 4 
          megabytes per second synchronous an onboard floppy disk 
          controller and a ROM BIOS  Please note that the 7000ASC 
          operates using standard DOS 32 or DOS 33 only
          
          7000FASST2  This SCSI host adapter card provides the same 
          features as the 7000ASC plus additional support capabilities 
          using software developed by Columbia Data Products  The 7000
          FASST2 will support MSDOS 3233 Compaq DOS 331 PCDOS 40 
          PCMOS386 version 21 XENIX Microsoft Windows Novell and 
          Sytos tape backup
          
          WDATXTFASST KIT  An unintelligent SCSI host adapter that is 
          compatible with the IBM XT AT and compatible systems  It uses 
          a 50 pin external SCSI bus D connector with a standard 50 pin 
          internal SCSI cable  The WDATXTFASST can be used as  both a 
          target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
          SCSI designers  It also provides a low cost alternative for end
          users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a 
          hard disk drive or a tape backup unit The kit includes an 8bit 
          SCSI HBA board manual FASST software diskettes and an internal 
          SCSI cable
