 Thats an easy one carry all 25 pins straight thru with the exception of
 pins 2  3 which should be crossed

as someone else already mentioned dont carry thru the other 23 pins

plan A minimal null modem
	SG7     SG7
	TD2     RD3
	RD3     TD2
if youre transfering files betwen 2 PCs this ought to work unless
you have a persnickity comm program

plan B null modem with modem control
	SG7     SG7
	TD2     RD3
	RD3     TD2
	DCD8    DTR20
	DTR20   DCD8
some comm software will wait for DCD before transferring anything
such software will raise DTR to enable the modem to accept a call
with this cable each sides DTR will drive the others DCD

plan C null modem with hardware flow control
	SG7     SG7
	TD2     RD3
	RD3     TD2
	RTS4    CTS5
	CTS5    RTS4
for highspeed transfers you want the flow control

plan D deluxe null modem combine B and C
	SG7     SG7
	TD2     RD3
	RD3     TD2
	RTS4    CTS5
	CTS5    RTS4
	DCD8    DTR20
	DTR20   DCD8
this one is ideal  it leaves out DSR and RI rarely used anymore
if youre really paranoid or you just have an 8th wire to spend
you might add
	FG1     FG1

the pin numbers above are obviously for 25pin connectors
i dont have a 9pin pinout handy
