Subject How to program a PC Keyboard itself

  Hi All

  I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards eg one
can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters etc
  Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some nontrivial data
to the KB as opposed to standard NumLock OnOff typeamatic specs from
inside the PC software I have not found any corresponding reference in the
specs for the 8042 PCKB interface Anyone have any ideas Except that they
may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above
which wouldnt look too neat besides what would one do from an XT

  Great thanks in advance

Andrew
