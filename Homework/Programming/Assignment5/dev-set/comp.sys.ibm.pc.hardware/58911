Subject Thanks Backing Up Masters


	Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my
masters  Apparently they are NOT copyprotected I just used a program that
is unable to handle highdensity old shit  I was surprised to hear that
NO programs on highdensity disks have copy protection which someone
back there said  Huh  Learn something new every day
