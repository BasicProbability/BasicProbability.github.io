Subject Is 9801MBsec HD transfer slow for 486DX50 EISA with UltraStor24F

Hi I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX50 My computer
configuration is 

486DX50 Mhz 8256 kB EISA Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz
16MB Ram
ST3283N 248 MB Harddisk SCSI
UltraStor24F EISA Cache Controller

When I use Norton60 Harddisk benchmark I get a Harddisk data transfer
about 980 kbsec and sometimes 1MBsec Is that good  I thought
that with EISA I could get about 2MBsec 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read that some host 
adapters need to perform a lowlevel format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system do I need that 
A guy I know gets a HD transfer about 12MBsec and he has an ST3283A and
a ISA 486DX50 how can a ISA with the same system be faster 

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk 


                                        Thanks
