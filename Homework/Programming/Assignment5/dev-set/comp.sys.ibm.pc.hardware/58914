Subject 486DX50 vs 486DX250 


AY  In many recent advertisements I have seen both 486DX50 and 486DX
AYbased systems Does the first really exists and does it imply that all
AYcircuitry on the motherboard with it works at that speed as opposite 
AYlatter where only the internals of the CPU are working at 50MHz

Andrew yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486  If you are 
considering buying one or the other definitely go for the DX with a nice 
size external cache  The performance is far greater

The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with  Neither 
systems could actually run a program out of main memory since DRAM is 
still too slow for that high of bus speed  60ns  1666MHz  50MHz
