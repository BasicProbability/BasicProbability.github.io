I believe Apple has a patent on the region features of QuickDraw  A mac
clone would have to implement regions  This is why Apples comment was
that
they believe it is not possible to make a Mac clone without infringing
on their patents  They may have other patents like this

Apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably
includes the internal data structure which has never been officially
documented by Apple  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region

Im guessing that either NuTek reverseengineered Apples internal data
structure for regions I dunno if this would hold up in court or they
came up with their own data structure  If its the latter then they
wont be able to draw PICT files containing regions  Besides PICT files
there arent many places where regions are stored on disk  QuickTime
movies perhaps  As long as the region isnt being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone or vice versa it doesnt
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac
