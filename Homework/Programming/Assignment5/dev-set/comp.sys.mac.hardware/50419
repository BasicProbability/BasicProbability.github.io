Subject Re your opinion of the LaserWriter Select 310


My wife has one of these  I have not had much chance to fiddle with
it but in comparison to our Laserwriters with Canon engines she
complains that the print is too light for her taste  The difference
is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is
adjusted to the darkest possible level  I dont find it
objectionable and indeed rather like it but be warned that some
people dont care for it and it is considerably different 

I recall that years ago there were lots of debates over writeblack
vs writewhite engines when dealing with TeX drivers  Is something
like that going on here
