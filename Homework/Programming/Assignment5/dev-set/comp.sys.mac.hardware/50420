Subject Floptical Question

Hi I am looking into buying a Floptical Drive and was wondering what  
experience people have with the drives from Iomega PLI MASS MicroSystems  
or Procom These seem to be the main drives on the market Any advice

Also I heard about some article in MacWorld Sep 92 I think about  
Flopticals Could someone post a summary if they have it

Thanks in advance Reply by post or email whichever you prefer
