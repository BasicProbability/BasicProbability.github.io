Subject Re Centris Cache  Bernoulli Box

I just tried running my Bernoulli Box off a Centris and the driver
software only seems to work when the 040 cache is off  If it is
on I get the message This is not a Macintosh Disk  do you wish
to initialize it  

I have IOMEGA Driver 342  Is there a newer version that works
with the 040s  Is there something I am doing wrong

I Have Version 351 which I believe was needed for a 040 machine
You should be able to get the newest version by calling their tech
support at 18004565522 or if you have a modem you can get the
driver from their BBS at 8017784400
