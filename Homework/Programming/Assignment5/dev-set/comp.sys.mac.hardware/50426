Subject how do you like the Apple Color OneScanner

Were all set to buy one of these for the office to use for scanning in
color photographs and for optical character recognition  Weve played with
the original grayscale OneScanner and were very pleased  Is the color model
comparable in quality

Also what brand of OCR software would you recommend  Were leaning toward
Caere OmniPage  Any better ideas  Thanks
