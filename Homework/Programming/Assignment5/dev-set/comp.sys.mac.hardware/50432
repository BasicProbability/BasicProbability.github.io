Subject Sound input in SE30

A couple of questions for the multimedia set


1  Does anybody have a phone or fax number or email address or name of a
principal in CEDAR Technologies in Dublin New Hampshire All I have is a
postoffice box number and I want to ask a couple of questions before
sending
them some money  Any info much appreciated

2  Im running an SE30 which came with no microphone Is there any way
other than using MacRecorder with SoundEdit or CEDARs digitizer with some
similar software to input recorded sound into my Mac Im trying to play
some
very short interview clips in a HyperCard stack

Thanks for any and all help
