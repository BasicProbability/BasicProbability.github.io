    the Sony CPD1304 has better video circuitry than either of the
   other two monitors  It can display Apple 640x480 VGA 640x480 VGA
   800x600 though this has 56 Hz flicker and Apple 832x624 75 Hz
   refresh  no flicker at all  It might be able to display Apples
   1024x768 but Im not sure about this and the pixels would be real
   small anyway so it might not be that useful

   Note that with either Sony monitor you will need the proper adapter
   which both connects the video signals properly but also informs the
   Macintosh video hardware of which display mode to use

Im assuming that the cabling tells the Mac at startup what kind of
monitor is connected  Now I think Ive seen ads in popular Mac
magazines for products Im not sure if its just a monitor just a
video card or a package of both that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly wo restarting the Mac

If you were to buy a 1304 would it be possible to switch back and
forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the
Mac  Is this strictly a hardware startup function or can software
intervene or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically

Thanks
