Subject Disappointed by La Cie

Approximately four months ago I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
649 After two months the drive started having problems First there were
intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then Silverlining
541 wouldnt even recognize the drive So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one

Well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems
Often when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark Sometimes if I
then insert the Silverlining 542 program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD Ive called La Cie again and theyve given me
another RMA Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesnt see
the drive theres a definite hardware problem

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months I asked La Cie to send
me a new one but they said no Also within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive La Cie dropped the price on it by over 100

I can accept that a drive or two may be bad And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations Nevertheless taken together the convergence of these
factsevents have left a bad taste in my mouth I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will sendI think the data is still in good shape and Ill have to again
reinstall everything from floppiesthey said it would cost me 250 for data
recovery

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still
covered under a 90day warranty should be new 

I feel a little helpless about all this I dont mean to necessarily flame La
Cietheir support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful
But cmon Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way I sent
a letter to La Cies customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product They didnt even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other

Whats the moral of this story Im not sure But I do know I wont buy any
other products from La Cie in the future

Ill be taking my business elsewhere in the future
