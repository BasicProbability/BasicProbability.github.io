Subject built in video

I have MANY questions for all you experts out there pertaining to apples
builtin video  

1 Do all macs that have builtin video have the ability to use VGA monitors
2 If soif not which macs have this capability
3 Can they drive SVGA as well
4 how big of a vga monitor can they drive
5 how can you tell if an unlabeled monitor is VGA  By the pinouts
    if so what should it look like

Particularly im interested in knowing if the si or ci drive VGA as well
as the LCs capabilities in driving VGASVGA

Thanks
