Subject RESULTS of Mathematica Speed Tests

Well here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to
this newsgroup  The test was the following command

Plot3D29000231416x50002y80002
810000001539000231416x100002
y10002810000001542000231416
x70002y100002400000015
x550019500y550019500PlotPoints50


I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and
workstations  The results are posted below

Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines lots slower in fact  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it  Wow 

Basically though I wouldnt draw any conclusions from this data  It
seems that Mathematicas speed is dependant on a lot of variables  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up  

Well if you have any questions or if I forgot something just drop me
a line at cmmilleriastateedu

PS  If the spacing of the above table doesnt come out right on your
machine tell me and Ill mail you a copy of this in a binhexed Word
51 document
