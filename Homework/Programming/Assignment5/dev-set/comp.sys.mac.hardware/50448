Subject Re Caps Lock vs control  wasRe Apple keyboard 

Please excuse and redirect me if this has already been answered but is
there a small utility that switches the functionality of the capslock
key and the ctrl key on the powerbook keyboard  I use the ctrl key far
more than capslock so it would be more convenient and comfortable
Thank you for any help
