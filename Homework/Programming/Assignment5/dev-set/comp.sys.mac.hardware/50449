Subject MAC to LaserJet IIIp
From osterberhusc8harvardedu Richard Osterberg


I have a friend who has a MAC LC or LC II I think and her family has an
extra LaserJet IIIp sitting around Is there any way to connect these
two and make them work without a postscript cartridge  She told me that a
random friend of hers had mentioned something about some software package
that could do the translation
