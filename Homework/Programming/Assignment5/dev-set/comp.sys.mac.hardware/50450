         I had asked everyone about problems installing a 4 meg
 simm and an 8 meg simm in my Centris 610 but the folks at the
 local Apple store called the folks in Cupertino and found that
 you cant have simms of different speeds in one machine even
 if they are both fast enough  ie  My 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4
 meg simms were incompatibable  Just thought people might
 want to know

Theres absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time 
alone would cause an incompatibility  There would have to be another 
difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem  Ive often used 
memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever  As long as its
as fast or faster than the minimum requirement you should be fine

Just out of curiosity did you actually try this and see a problem or 
were you told it wouldnt work and so never tried it  Also out of 
curiosity do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to as 
Id like to find out what theyre basing this recommendation on
