Subject X for PC


I have heard of two packages for the PC that support XWin
The first is Linux which is a free Unix Package  The Second
is XAppeal which sounds pretty good  It can be found at
 garbouwusafi in the ftppcdemo dir  The files are

	xap13exezip
	xap10fonzip
	driverszip

This should get you started
