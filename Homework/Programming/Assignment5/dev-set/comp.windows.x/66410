I might have a need in the future to display rotated text  I noticed the
xvertext package on the net  It looks very good but it has one slight
problem  The API to it assumes you have a font name not an already loaded
font  It shouldnt be too difficult to split up the function into two
interface routines one with a font name and one with an XFontStruct but
I thought I would ask the author Alan Richardson
mppa3ukacsussexsyma first in case he was planning this already
Unfortunately his email address bounced  Does Alan R or the current
maintainer of xvertext see this

The email address you mentioned above is for use with the UK  As you know
the Brits do everything backwards   So the real address from the states is

	mppa3symasussexacuk

Give it a try
