Theres a bug in SunOS 413 which is alluded to in the FAQ although
there its talking about X11R4 as being affected  You need to force
libXmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works
around the linker error  The simplest thing to do is edit each of
the Makefiles where theres a failure and change the line which reads
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC lXmu
to
	XMULIB  LXMUSRC Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic

No This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3x as shipped with SunOS
It is not relevant for MIT R5 MIT R5 should compile without problems
