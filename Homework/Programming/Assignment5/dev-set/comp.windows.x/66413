 Can people please send me any hints on building X11R5 with gcc 233   Is
 there any pitfalls to be avoided   Any hints   I would appreciate hearing other
 peoples stories on this

I have been building X11 with gcc since 21 and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke so I
couldnt use gcc to build Sun shared libraries The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries
