Subject Getting Pseudo TTY in XMotif

Hi

I am about to write an application in XMotif that will require the
embedding of a pseudo tty So before I reinvent the wheel has anyone
writtengotten a motif widget that does the job  Otherwise I would
appreciate any pointers to make such a beast

My environment is X11R4Motif 11 and X11R5Motif 12 if this helps


Thanks in advance
