Subject Experiences of DESQviewX 

I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application  namely
MicroSoft Project  The original system ran on the PC Now it needs to
be expanded to allow UNIX users to work with the application The
current proposal is to use DESQviewX as a display server for the
application

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQviewX to run an
application on a PC and displaying on a SPARCstation Ive heard that
the network traffic is slow

Replies only by email please

Thanks in advance
