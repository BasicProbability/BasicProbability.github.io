Subject Re TeleUse UIMX and C


 
 Does anyone have any good ideas on how to integrate C code elegantly
 with TeleUse UIMX  Interface Architect generated code
 
 Source would be great but any suggestions are welcome

Its my understanding that the next release of UIMX due out
last February  has full support for C

I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages
of these other tools but does fully support C code generation
reusable templates via C classes which are generated a variety of
other handy features for using C and layout functions in different
ways and generates Motif 12 code including drag n drop 
internationalization etc  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Youngs
paradigm for CMotif
