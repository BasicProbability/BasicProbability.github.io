 Hello
 
 does somebody know the functions  XtShellStrings and XtStrings
 I havent found them in any librarys not Xm Xt nor X11 and I need
 them to install a tool
 
 Any hints greatly appreciated Please reply via email

They arent functions they are character arrays The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other It is probably worth
adding DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS
