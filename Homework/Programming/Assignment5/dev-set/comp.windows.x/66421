Subject Re Honors Degrees Do they mean anything

In article TKLD93Apr2123341burnscogsciedacuk tkldcogsciedacuk Kevin Davidson writes

   In my opinion a programming degree is still worth having

 Yes but a CS degree is not a programming degree Does anybody know of
a computing course where programming is taught  Computer Science is
a branch of maths or the course I did was
 Ive also done a Software Engineering course  much more practical and likely
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants rather than what they think
they want but also did not teach programming The ability to program was
an entry requirement

At Robert Gordon University programming was the main most timeconsuming 
start of the course The first two years consisted of five subjects
Software Engineering PascalCUNIX Computer Engineering 6502680968000 
assembler Computer Theory LISPProlog MathematicsStatistics and 
Communication Skills How to pass interviewsintelligence tests and group
discussions eg How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea
The third year Industrial placement was spent working for a computer company 
for a year The company could be anywhere in Europe there was a special 
Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors  
The fourth year included Operating SystemsCModula2 Software Engineering 
C8086 assembler Real Time Laboratory C68000 assembler and Computing 
Theory LISP  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years where 
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
outside company the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
suddenly
 
In the first four years there was a 5050 weighting between courseworks and 
exams for most subjects However in the Honours year this was reduced to a 
3070 split between an Individual Project and final exams no coursework 
assessment  are all Computer Science courses like this

BTW  we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
Honours year Also every course is tutored separately Not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class  

Cheers
