Subject  92  TOPIC BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION topic needs updating to R5

Subject  93  Whats a good source of information on configuring the X build

	This FAQ includes information on a number of gotchas that can bite 
you on particular system However the best source of general information on 
building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release so if its become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately the file RELNOTESmsPSTXT at 
the top of the distribution The file RELNOTES is also available from the 
xstuff mail server
	In addition OReilly  Associatess Volume 8 on X Administration
includes information on configuring and building X


Subject  94  Why doesnt my Sun with a cg6 work with R5

	Apparently gcc is the problem it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix The new sunGXo distributed with fix07 
may fix the problem note not known to work on Solaris


Subject  95  Why doesnt my Sun with SunOS 41 know about dlsym etc

	If you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with 
libdla  Add ldl to your and eventually your sitedef  You may want to 
surround it with Bstatic ldl Bdynamic if you add it to the EXTRALIBRARIES
variable since syslibs get added after EXTRALIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command otherwise you may not have a shared libdl  Or compile 
the stubs shared

Subject  96  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 412

	In SunOS 412 Sun fixed a sharedlibrary bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some X11 clients 
	getwmShellWidgetClass
	getapplicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic appears to work 

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 30 X11R4based Xt please 
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches

Patch id      Description
10051202       41x OpenWindows 30 libXt Jumbo patch

A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad

Subject  97  Why cant gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC
I used gcc to compile the whole distribution but I get several segmentation
faults when running X

	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
680x0 or VAX platforms

	Here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when 
gcccompiled parts of X are linked with Sunsupplied functions that pass or 
return structs runtime errors occur  Affected programs include rgb and 
the server

	This is from the GCC manual

	On the Sparc GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures  It passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference

	This really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in GNU CC so it isnt straightforward to fix it

	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible and
	fpccstructreturn does not help

You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags  

	Files which need to be compiled using cc include
		serveros42bsdoscolorc 
		rgbrgbc

	In addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or
return values  
		clientsxhostxhostc 
		clientsxauthgethostc 
Calls to inetaddr in libCLXsocketc and libXXConnDisc are possibly 
harmless as they dont involve structs

Subject  98  What are these IO errors running X built with gcc
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	Getting interface configuration Operation not supported on socket 
	Fatal server bug no screens found

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didnt work You can do 
this simple test

	include sysioctlh
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc E and gcc E  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace  If the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your 
fixincludes run didnt work for some reason or other go back to your gcc
sources and run fixincludes then rebuild the X distribution If they are 
identical try running a make clean in mitserver and rebuilding just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files

In mitserverddxsunsunCG3Cc we have found missing defines for 
CG3ACMONOLEN CG3BCMONOLEN CG3ACENBLEN CG3BCENBLEN What should these be

	The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older SunOS versions eg 35 to compile
        define CG3ACMONOLEN 1281024
        define CG3ACENBLEN  CG3ACMONOLEN
        define CG3BCMONOLEN CG3ACMONOLEN
        define CG3BCENBLEN  CG3ACMONOLEN

	However the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device and so 
references to it can be removed from mitserverddxsunsunInitc and the 
Imakefile  1190


Subject 100  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 411
The file sundevcg6regh isnt being found

	Sun omitted sundevcg6regh from SunOS 411 Remove the include 
from sunCG6Cc and replace it with the line 
	define CG6VADDRCOLOR   0x70016000
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution


Subject 101  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4
All of the executables that I try to run have the following results
	ldso libXmuso4 not found
or even
	ldso call to undefined procedure GetHostname from 0xf776a96c

	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun remember that you 
need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if youve
installed X on a fileserver run it on the servers clients too  While 
building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have eg those 
distributed with OpenWindows  You should make sure you do not have 
LDLIBRARYPATH set in your environment during the build or the installation  
If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in usrlib usrlocallib or 
usr5lib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked 
statically courtesy MIT X Consortium
	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it
attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed
You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass Bstatic to
most C compilers


Subject 102  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt XtQString undefined

This is a bug in the OLIT  XtQString was an external symbol that existed in 
X11R4 upon which OW 30s libXt is based  It wasnt documented and was 
removed in X11R5 MITs guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5
libraries only applied to the documented interface  

A workaround is to temporarily set your LDLIBRARYPATH to point to the X11R4
or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against

Subject 103  How do I get around the SunOS 41 security hole

	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients xterm and xload
running under SunOS 41 that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries to avoid the problem do one of these
	1 make the program nonsetuid You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources eg ptys and devkmem used
by these programs to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site
	2 relink the programs statically using Bstatic
	3 install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries

from rwsexpolcsmitedu Bob Scheifler 1290

The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newlyinstalled libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively Note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFSmounted disks 
Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem


Subject 104  How do I get around the framebuffer security hole

	On many systems the framebuffer is unsecured by default this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the framebuffer directly or as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying to accidentally start up a second X session on your console 
display Check the man page for fbtab5

Subject 105  TOPIC BUILDING X PROGRAMS 

Subject 106  What is Imake

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a
makefilegenerator that takes advantages of the includefile and macro
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system Although it is not 
specific to X the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by
which the systemspecific configuration files systemindependent configuration
files and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious
	There have been several different versions of imake the R3 R4 and
R5 versions are different

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources
	 the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	 the R4 and R5 file mitconfigREADME also contains useful information
	 on the R4 tapes contribdocimakeimaketex is Mark Moraes R3R4
guide to imake
	 the R5 mitdocconfigusenixwspaperms contains a paper by Jim
Fulton on an early version of Imake
	 Paul Dubois duboisprimatewiscedu has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non
supported systems the document is available from ftpprimatewiscedu

Subject 107  Where can I get imake

	Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases An earlier 
version is distributed with the X11R3 release some thirdparty toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files There are no real standards for such 
configuration files although most current contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with X11R5
	export contains the R5 distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution
	A standalone version of Imake but one stemming from X11R5 is in
ftpgermanyeunetpubX11miscimakeimakepuretarZ 1927614475


Subject 108  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile What to do

	If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system run xmkmf This is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments The output is a 
Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile Then run make 
which will use that new Makefile to compile the program


Subject 109  Why cant I link to the Xlib shape routines
When I try to compile certain programs I get the following link error
	Undefined
	XShapeQueryExtension
	XShapeCombineMask

	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X SHAPE
which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows nonrectangular
windows  Like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it  PreX11R4 servers as well as many 
vendorsupplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway

	In order to use the shape extension you must link to the library 
libXexta  In the X11R4 distribution this library and the associated includes
will be in the mitextensions directory  If you do not have these files do 
not despair  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the DSHAPE define from the Makefile you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendorsupplied X 
libraries

Subject 110  What are these problems with XtInherit not found on the Sun
When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 403 or 41 machine I get the 
error ldso symbol not found XtInherit

	What you are seeing is a sideeffect of a kludge in the R4 libXta to 
get Sun shared libraries working  Apparently you cant share a function that 
is both called and compared as XtInherit is This was handled by putting 
XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded  that is in Initializec where 
XtToolkitInitialize and XtInitialize reside These routines would normally
be called

	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
Xtbased program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize anywhere 
	1 it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the X server  OSFMotifs 110 UIL had this problem it called
XtMalloc and other Xt functions The solution is to add the call to your 
program the function does not have to be executed just linked in
	2 alternatively your program doesnt need any Xt functions and is
correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize  it may be an Xlib or XView 
program In this case you can remove lXt from your link command 

	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically
although this will certainly solve the problem

Subject 111  Why cant I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X
I have a program that worked well under X11R3 When I try to link it under 
the current version of X I get this message
	Undefined
	XtScrollBarSetThumb
	XtTextSetInsertionPoint
	XtTextReplace

	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set in addition
to the header files moving into X11Xaw these are mentioned in the R4
release notes In this case these functions are not really Xt functions but
are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt to Xaw

Subject 112  TOPIC PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES

Subject 113  Why doesnt my program get the keystrokes I select for sic

	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another  In order to get keystrokes your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus  To do this you must set up what are
called hints for the window manager  If your applications is Xlibbased you
can use something like the following

        XWMHints wmhints
        
        wmhintsflags  InputHint
        wmhintsinput  True
        XSetWMHintsdpy window wmhints

If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics you can set the XtNinput 
resource to be True as you probably want to in any case if you dont have
source you can start up the application with the resource inputTrue

Certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having 
this done 

	If you are using Suns OpenWindows olwm you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that arent ICCCMcompliant
	OpenWindowsFocusLenience       true

Subject 114  How do I figure out what window manager is running

	You cant reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case 
	For most cases you shouldnt care which window manager is running so 
long as you do things in an ICCCMconformant manner There are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases Alternatively it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific added features such as olwms pushpin menus in order
to give your program added functionality Beware of usurping the window 
managers functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing
this surely leads to future compatibility problems


Subject 115  Is there a skeleton X program available
	
	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the 
Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development In X the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cutpaste on existing X applications Good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just 
this one little thing include contribclientsxskel a simple R4 program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks the Xaw examples in the examples directory in the R3 and R4 
distributions and the Xlib Hello World example in the R3 docHelloWorld and 
R4 doctutorialsHelloWorld an updated version of this program which uses R4 
Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 290 to compwindowsx  
by Glenn Widener of Tektronix 	390

	In addition a sample Xt program for Xaw or Xm by Rainer Klute 
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display 
connection is available on exportlcsmitedu in contribmdisptarZ 492


Subject 116  Why does XtGetValues not work for me sic

	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable Your code may be doing something like this
	
	Arg args3
	int i
	int sensitive		 oops wrong data type 
	i0
	XtSetArg argsi XtNsensitive sensitive i
	XtGetValueswidget args i 
	
	

But XtNsensitive is a Boolean which on most machines is a single byte 
declaring the variable sensitive as Boolean works properly This problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types 
Dimension and Position code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short In general you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widgets man page
1190


Subject 117  Why dont XtConfigureWidgetXtResizeWidgetXtMoveWidget work

	Youre probably trying to use these functions from application code
They should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children Other promising 
functions XtMakeGeometryRequest and XtMakeResizeRequest are also for use 
only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent
	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources
Although this will result in the widgetinternal functions being called your
application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the 
widgets data becoming corrupted
	The Xlib calls XMoveWindow and XResizeWindow should similarly be 
avoided they shouldnt be used to change XtNx XtNy XtNwidth or XtNheight


Subject 118  Why isnt there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow

	Although there are various details of the current implementation of
the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the new widget should be Resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves
What should happen to the widgets children And by the time such semantics are
defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget

	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit
