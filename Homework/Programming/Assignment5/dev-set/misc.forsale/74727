Subject Re Deal gone bad What to do

 rjkoppesnewsweeguiowaedu Randy Koppes writes

  Have you head of small claims  You may have to put money up
  front for the filing fees and then possibly having the local 
  sheriff of hisher city to deliver the bad news  In the end 
  the other party will end up paying for hisher mistake with 
  interest from the time of the filing to the pay date of the
  defendent

I think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
the location of the person youre taking action against  It seems to
me the time and money involved in travelling out there unless this
person is close to you wouldnt be worth it for a small claim
It really depends on how much money youre out

If I am wrong about any of this someone please correct me
