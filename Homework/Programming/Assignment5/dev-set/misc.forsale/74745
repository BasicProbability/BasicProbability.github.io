 Is anybody awake out there  When someone posted a message telling people to
 stop posting computer ads to the miscforsale group he got about thirty
 response here not to mention the rash of EMail Im sure he received  Yet
 another person posts a message with the subject line blow me and an even 
 worse text and only 3 or 4 people have the guts to say anything  The majority

Not to mention the thread about selling someones wife I am a guy therefore
not overly bummed by it but a little common sense would dictate that this
is offensive to many women and not really necessary
