Those are the numbers I was quoting I have driven the older model but not the
newer


sure sounds like they got a ringer  the 325is i drove was definitely
faster than that  if you want to quote numbers my AW AutoFile shows
060 in 74 14 mile in 159  it quotes Car and Drivers figures
of 69 and 153  oh BTW these numbers are for the 325i

i dont know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it
but dont take my word for it  go drive it
