 which turns into a teenagers car when it gets old The average  
lifelength of
 a Volvo in Norway is 18 years and in Sweden 20 years

Of course someone pointed out when Saab or Volvo was running their
At least 10 years ads that the average milage was significantly
less than than the US average

That my be but every Volvo Ive ever owned has lasted far longer than most
other cars
1981 Volvo 245125000 Miles still on the road
1983 Volvo 242195000 Miles still on the road
1984 Volvo 244175000 Miles still on the road
And Ill admit the dealer repair cost is high But with some mechanical
aptitude of your own and finding a good indi mechanic you can avoid most
breakdowns and make the rest cheapThe sum total of the repairs on the car with
195000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator Whoa Bad repair record 
And all of these cars are driven fairly hard None of them are at the head of
a line of cars going 30 MPHthe first two spend a lot of their operating
life with the speedometer peggedand the only reason the 84 doesnt is it has
a 120 MPH speedo
What I want to know ishave all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized
by someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road or what
