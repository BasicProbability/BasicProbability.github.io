Subject Radio for Toyota Tercel

Im looking for a replacement radiotape player for a 1984 
Toyota Tercel  Standard offtheshelf unit is fine but 
every place Ive gone to Service Merchandise etc doesnt 
have my car in its model application book  I want to just 
take out the old radio and slide in the new with minimal time
spent hooking it up and adjusting the dashboard

If you have put in a new unit in a similar car Id like to hear
what brand  how easy it was to do the change and any other 
relevant information 

Please answer via Email
Thanks  Tom Ostrand
