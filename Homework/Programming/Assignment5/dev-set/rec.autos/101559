Hi being new to a car owner I would pretty much like to know more about 
some basics of maintaining the cars

I know the following

1 Oil has to be changed every 3000 miles

Change the oil filter too

2 Check tires before going on the high way And fill up the tank

Make that monthly or more often if you know one or more of your
tires has a slow leak

If the tire has a leak you should fix it 


What others Thank you


4 Check ALL fluids regularly every month check the oil every time you
   fill up with gas

Doesnt work too well if the engine is hot its more accurate to check the
oil when the engine is cool ie not when you are at a gas station
