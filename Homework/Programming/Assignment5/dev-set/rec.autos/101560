 Its great that all these other cars can outhandle outcorner and  
out
 accelerate an Integra
 
 But youve got to ask yourself one question do all these other cars  
have
 a moonroof with a sliding sunshade  No wimpy popup sunroofs or power
 sliding roofs that are opaque  A moonroof that can be opened to the  
air
 closed to let just light in or shaded so that nothing comes in
 
 Youve just got to know whats important
