      Id like to add the Beretta GTZ as a car which will kick GSR butt
 anyday and its a lot cheaper to boot

 I will take this one with a definate grain of salt  Performance data shows a

 If this poster has some proofother than my friend blew one away last week


     Want proof  Here is some data on acceleration and handling from
Motor Trend apr 93

          Integra GSR     Beretta GTZ

060         77             77
14 mile     160881       161878
L acc gs  84             86
Slalom       637            684
WRONG
Why dont you look again at Motor Trends slalom times they are 679 right
along with the Integra and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all weather XGTV4 not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta
Your acceleartion times also vary magazine to magazine
Road  Track and Car Driver have the GSR at 68 to 80 for Road and Track
Also Quarter mile times vary from 154 to 161
You cant tell exactly by the numbers  Furthermore the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end  Car  Driver and Road  track
have the GSR doing 136 to 141 mph and it gets there fast


     So the Beretta can out handle the Integra and it can certainly keep
up with it in acceleration  And the Beretta probably has a higher top
speed due to the horsepower advantage 160117 hptorque for the
Integra vs 180160 for the Beretta
You always believe those exact numbers why dont you drive a GSR and see
for your self while the GSR has a low 117 torqye its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference still wouldnt call it a torque moster though

     The biggest advantage would have to be the price  The Integra costs
19111 as tested Motor Trend the GTZ costs 16134 as tested  The
GTZ also has standard nicities and Airbag and Antilock brakes  An airbag
is not available on the Integra and lower models do not have ABS
Considering you save almost 3000 dollars for the Beretta and the Quad4
is a reliable engine it doesnt make sense to get the Integra as a
performance coupe which is what people have been trying to make it out
to be


Quad 4 reliable yeah whats your definition of reliable if thats reliable
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 not to mention a hell of alot smoother and quieter  balance shaftsThe Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down You can rev that car all day everyday
and youll never blow a hose or crack the block or anything else I speak
from expierence
Im not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine but dont highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine  AND while the Integra costs alot more it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time

NOTE this isnt a flame on the GTZ or other GM Quad 4 products  THe Berreta
is a nice car and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention it has an Airbag  But to start quoting figures from one
source isnt too reliable  Read other sources and drive both cars  While I
havent driven a GTZ I have driven GTs and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines
so they are similair
