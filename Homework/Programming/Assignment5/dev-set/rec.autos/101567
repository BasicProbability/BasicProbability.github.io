Subject Re WAX RESIDUE ON BLACK MOLDING

Sayeth Joseph D Mazza mazzandrewcmuedu
I waxed my car a few months ago with a liquid wax and now have whiteish
smears where I inadvertantly got some wax on the black plastic molding 
Ive tried repeatedly to remove the smears with no luck  Im on the
verge of replacing the molding altogether its a nice car

   Armor All removes Raindance wax on my Mazda Proteges black
plastic bumpers  Your mileage may vary

   Given this observation one would be well advised to take care not to
get any of this or probably similar protectants such as Son of a Gun
on ones paint 
 
I know that sometimes my jaw clicks when I eat  Void where prohibited
Have you seen this boy  Lust never sleeps  I say hurl  Honey Im
