Subject Re Who was   or   what is   MIATA as used in the Mazda Miata

Sayeth sjwyricklblgov Steve Wyrick
Anybody keeping track of how many of these there are  So far I have
Miata Tredia Previa Sentra Maxima Altima Camry and Justy not to
mention Lexus Acura and Infiniti  

   Youre apparently including names that are or appear to be
derivatives of real words in English or some other language eg
Acura Infiniti Maxima Altima in which case you missed ones such
as Integra Supra Allante Capri and Calibra  In Canada add Serenia and
Precidia  If you count misspellings add Protege and in Canada
Vigor  How about the forthcoming Mondeo if it is given that name
in North America

   Others might include Celica Corolla Paseo and Tercel  In Canada
add Asuna
