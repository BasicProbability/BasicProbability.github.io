Subject Re Jeep Grand vs Toyota 4Runner

I am considering buying one of these two vehicles new
I want a funtodrive family vehicle that can go through anything
The Jeep is very popular and has the features AllWheelDrive 4 wheel
antilock roomy passenger cabin but limited cargo with an internal spare
THe Toyota is an aging design with only parttime 4wheel and only rear
antilock and no antilock in 4WD It also has a very inconvenient
rear gate not to mention awkward ingress to the passenger cabin


Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned They arent really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum  not to mention price range
How about the Explorer Trooper Blazer Montero and if the budget
allows the Land Cruiser 
Bear in mind that 90 of all SUVs purchased never venture offroad
Carefully weigh the tradeoff between comfort and offroad performance
when choosing one and realistically decide whether youll actually
make enough use of the offroadability to sacrifice some of the
onroad comfort
