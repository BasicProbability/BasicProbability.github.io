Has anyone had any experience with GEICOs extended
warranty plan  It seems to be slightly less expensive than
the normal dealersponsored policy

and once againnever buy extended warrantiesthey are a complete and
total ripoff period  you are better off taking your money and putting it
 
in a bank and using that money for repairs  many extended warranties never
pay or have copayments etc  



How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the
sole use of a automotive repairmaybe for people who have a hard time saving
money or dont want the hassle of  worrying about paying for everything the 
extended warranty is worth itfor some people it is worth itothers not and
for some the peace of mind knowing you wont have too many unexpected expenses
is enoughif you drive a lot your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than
a yearhow many people can make the car payments as well as large repairs

It may work for some people
