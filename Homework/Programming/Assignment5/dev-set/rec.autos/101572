apparently youre not a woman  my husband hates the auto door locks
features but forgets that besides families with children a woman
feels safer in a car that locks easily in addition to watching around
 checking out if anyones near me when I get to my car  never park
in a secluded spot etc  have my keys ready to open the door so Im
not fumbling in my purse looking for them 

This has me thinking  Is there a biological reason why women cant put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants  I put my keys in one and wallent in another
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely
Everything is that much simpler for me  Why cant women do the same
Is is biological ie not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet or is it the way they are raised by the parents
