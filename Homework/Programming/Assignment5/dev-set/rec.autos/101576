Subject 93 Ford Probe GT  Engine problems

One of the local dealers has a used 7k miles 93 Probe GT
on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the
window saying the dealership bought the car back from
the previous owner because of Engine noises but that
the Ford district rep had OKed the car saying those
noises were normal  I thought it was worth looking
into the car seems otherwise clean and mentioned this
to a coworker who proceeded to tell me a horror story
about her sons 93 Probe GT which had several problems
ending with engine noises which she said was something
with the heads that Ford acknowledged the noise said
they were working on it but didnt have a cure as of
yet  Her son traded the car in and I checked  not
the same car  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring
problem with the V6 in the Probe GTs and by extension
with the Madza 626 and MX6

Anything to this  Id love to consider buying the GT Im
turning 40  time for my scheduled mid life crisis 
but Id hate to find out I just became the proud owner
of a Lemon
