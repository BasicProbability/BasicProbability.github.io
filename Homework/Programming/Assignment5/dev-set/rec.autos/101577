Subject Re Integra GSR really about other cars


Its great that all these other cars can outhandle outcorner and out
accelerate an Integra

But youve got to ask yourself one question do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade  No wimpy popup sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque  A moonroof that can be opened to the air
closed to let just light in or shaded so that nothing comes in

Youve just got to know whats important
