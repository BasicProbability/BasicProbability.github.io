Subject Ford Explorer 4WD  do I need performance axle

Were considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the
following questions All we would do is go skiing  no offroading

1 With 4WD do we need the performance axle  limited slip axle
Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires
are on different terrain 

2 Do we need the allterrain tires P23575X15 or will the
allseason P22570X15 be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe


Thanks


Tom
