Does it take any peculiar tools to remove the rear springs from a Ford
F350 truck  This is a 4x4 with leaf springs front and rear

So with a big socket and an air wrench and a floor jack and a 
hydrolic bottle jack  can I do this at home  

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks
And a can of WD40 helped

The sockets needed were metric exact fit but I was able to use
some SAE sockets  1316 and 1516 are rather close to 21 and 24mm
It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford 

Im pictureing this  Undo U bolts  Put a bottle jack on the axle
and raise the bedframe to take stress off of the leaf spring  Undo
the end boltsbushings  Drop the spring  Turn the bottom leaf 
Reconnect the spring bolts

Sounds about right

Didnt have to undo the end boltsbushings  Just the 2 U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber  Jacking up the frame some more
had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the floor jack high enough to
raise the frame  It one TALLL truck lifted the spring
free of the axel  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end  No wrench head  Vice Grips worked fine
I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off

Flipped the bottom spring and then

Is this a nightmare waiting to happen or an easy though physically
demanding thing to do

Well its easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 
OK well maybe its not that easy but its not terribly
difficult

I donno  Im a little more sore today than after working on a
1911A1 

A 15 foot pipe cheater was a real help  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ftlbs    A 1911A1 doesnt have that kind of
torque spec 

It was a challenge to get the pack bolt back in the spring pack  
Squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands   I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment then I could let go
to get the nut wrench Vice Grips

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too
until I discovered that the axel had 1 Tilted andor 2 rolled forward

One the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole  On the passenger side I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 12 inch to get things to line up  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a 
break and thought about WHY it wasnt lined up anymore since it HAD
been lined up before and I didnt move it something ELSE must 
have  hmmm axle no longer constrained not to move  hmmm move 
it back hmmm

After that it was all much easier to close up

BTW the ride is now softer but not quite as soft as I was hoping for
At least it now sits level
