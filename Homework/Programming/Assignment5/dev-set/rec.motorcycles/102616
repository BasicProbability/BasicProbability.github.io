			How do I get a DoD number

If the most Frequently Asked Question in recmotorcycles is What is the
DoD then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be How do I
get a DoD number That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List
KotL accept no substitue Keepers for a number If youre feeling
creative and your favorite number hasnt been taken already you can
make a request subject to KotL approval Warning nonnumeric non
base10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL Not
that you wont get it but you will pay for it

Oh and just one little tiny suggestion Ask the KotL in email Youll
just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
net and youll look like a clueless newbie too

By now youre probably asking So whos the KotL already Well as
John Sloan notes below thats about the only real secret left around
here but a few unsubtle hints can be divulged First it is not myself
nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe  though John was
the original KotL Second in keeping with the true spirit of Unix the
KotLs first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely
with hexadecimal characters 25 the KotL shares his name with a line
oriented text utility Third he has occasionally been seen posting
messages bestowing new DoD numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie
mailers Fourth there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a
DeadHead

 Newsflash A message from the KotL 

Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
groveled to the KotL please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed
work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
something done  Your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp
days perhaps even horrors a week or two  During such times of
economic activity on the part of the KotLs employers sending yet
another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it
just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an
excersize for the reader  If you suspect mailer problems at least
annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think
the KotL memorizes the list



One more thing the KotL says that its telepathic powers arent what
they used to be So provide some information for the list will ya
The typical DoD List entry contains number name statecountry 
email address For example

0111Ed GreenCAedgreenEastSunCOM

PS While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
requirements for DoD membership thats not strictly true these days as
there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both

            Denizens of Doom by Bruce Tanner DoD 0161

      Road Rider August 1991 reprinted with Bruces permission

There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
things that a bunch of bikers do  They discuss motorcycles and  
motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops  
helmets antifog shields spine protectors aerodynamics threeangle valve
seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy 
traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double 
entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship  They 
argue with each other and plan rides together

The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that 
although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each 
other face to face  The members of this group live all over the known world 
and communicate with each other electronically via computer

The computers range from laptops to multimillion dollar computer centers  
the people range from college and university students to hightech industry 
professionals to publicaccess electronic bulletinboard users  Currently 
recmotorcycles pronounced wreckdotmotorcycles its the file name for 
the groups primary online meeting place carries about 2250 articles per 
month  it is read by an estimated 29000 people  Most of the frequent 
posters belong to a motorcycle club the Denizens of Doom usually referred 
to as the DoD

The DoD started when motorcyclist John R Nickerson wrote a couple of 
parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes  Fellow computer 
enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name Denizen 
of Doom  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr 0003 Keeper of 
the Flame  Bruce was then designated DoD nr 0002 retroactively and of 
course Nickerson the originator of the parodies was given DoD nr 0001

The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules 
appealed to many so John Sloan  DoD nr 0011  became Keeper of the 
List issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one  To date there have been 
almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and 
Canada as well as Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom France 
Germany Norway and Finland

Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch  The initial run 
of 300 patches sold out immediately  The profits from this went to the 
American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation  Another AMHF fund raiser  
selling Denizens of Doom pins to members  was started by Arnie Skurow a 
few months later  Again the project was successful and the profits were 
donated to the foundation  So far the Denizens have contributed over 1500 
to the AMA museum  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs 
in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum

As often as possible the DoDers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go 
riding together  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
DoDers are centered near DenverBoulder Colorado and in Californias 
Silicon Valley  Consequently two major events are the annual Assault on 
Rollins Pass in Colorado and the Northern versus Southern California 
Joust

The RideandFeed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass followed by a big 
barbecue dinner  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern 
California ride south riders from Southern California to ride north 
meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle  An additional plan 
for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction 
with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus Ohio in July

Though its a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective 
communications hub recmotorcycles will not replace the more traditional 
motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
search of twowheeled camaraderie its a great way for kindred spirits to 
get together  Long may they flame


Live to Flame  Flame to Live	centerbar

This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which 
you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do 
anything like that face to face  These insults are known as flames  
issuing them is called flaming  Flames often start when a member 
disagrees with something another member has posted over the network  A 
typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be 
something like  What an incredibly stupid statement you Spandexclad 
poseur  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding 
ability and your cat



          The Denizens of Doom The Saga Unfolds

                  by John Sloan  DoD 0011

Periodically the question What is DoD is raised This is one of
those questions in the same class as Why is the sky blue If there
is a God why is there so much suffering in the world and Why do
women inevitably tell you that youre such a nice guy just before they
dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition
and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion
by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the
halls of academe for generations 

A long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few
minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on
a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two
machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another
via a system in Chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but
who was eventually assigned the DoD membership 1 wrote a satire of
the various personalities and flame wars of recmotorcycles and
signed it The Denizen of Doom Not wishing to identify himself he
asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
become DoD 2 to post it for him DoD 2 not really giving a whit
about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
individual did so  Flaming and other amusements followed 

He who would become the holder of DoD membership 3 thought this was
the funniest thing hed seen in a while being the sort that is pretty
easily amused so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club and started signing his postings with his membership
number 

Perhaps readers of recmotorcycles were struck with the vision of a
motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or
make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized
electronically  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a
part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a
gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the
sum of its parts  It could also be that were all computer nerds who
wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen
to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
minded enough to accept us as members 

In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy The Denizens of Doom
Motorcycle Club was born A club in which the majority of members have
never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet
feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some
of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup A club organized
and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the
network via electronic news and mail with a membershipmailing list
often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating
around the country organized by DoD 9 club patches organized by
11 and even an MTVstyle music video produced by 47 and
distributed on VHS by 18 

Where will it end Who knows Will the DoD start sanctioning races
placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the onboard engine
management computers Will the DoD organize poker runs where each
participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards
Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
room and at least a 386sized UNIX system Only time will tell 

The DoD has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net
access and a love for motorcycles To become a member one need only
ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
really good club secrets New members will receive via email a
membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which
includes name state and email address 

The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever or at least
until next year when we may decided to change the name 

                  Live to Flame  Flame to Live

material and viewer discretion is advised 



          Script for the Denizens of Doom Anthem Video

                by Jonathan E Quist   DoD 94


Scene  A sterile engineering office  A lone figure whom well call
Chuck stands by a printer output bin wearing a white CDC lab coat
with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector 

editors note For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
the First Annual DoD UniCoastal Ironhorse Ride  Joust by denizens
referring to each other as Chuck I guess you had to be there I
wasnt 

Chuck  I didnt want to be a Software Systems Analyst
 cowtowing to the whims of a machine and saying yessir nosir
 mayIhaveanothersir  My mother made me do it  I wanted
 to live a mans life
Music slowly builds in background
 riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes
 and the deepest valleys
 living the life of a Motorcyclist
 doing donuts and evading the police
 terrorizing old ladies and raping small children
 eating small dogs for tea and large dogs for dinner  In short

	I Want to be      A Denizen

Chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket with
fringe boots and cap  Scene simultaneously changes to the top of
an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass  A small throng of Hells Angels
sit on their Harleys in the near background gunning their engines
showering lookerson with nails as they turn donuts and leaking oil
on the tarmac  Chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed Fat
Boy 

Chuck Sings to the tune of The Lumberjack Song

Im a Denizen and Im okay
I flame all night and I ride all day

Hells Angels Echo Chorus surprisingly heavy on tenors
Hes a Denizen and hes okay
He flames all night and he rides all day

I ride my bike
I eat my lunch
I go to the lavatry
On Wednesdays I ride Skyline
Running children down with glee

Chorus
He rides his bike
He eats his lunch
He goes to the lavatry
On Wednesdays he rides Skyline
Running children down with glee

Chorus refrain
Cause Hes a Denizen

I ride real fast
My name is Chuck
It somehow seems to fit
I overrate the worst bad fck
But like a real good sht

Oh Im a Denizen and Im okay
I flame all night and I ride all day

Chorus refrain
Oh Hes a Denizen

I wear high heels
And bright pink shorts
 full leathers and a bra
I wish I rode a Harley
 just like my dear mama

Chorus refrain



                    Why you have to be killed

Well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed
to read this far and still not figure it out is that the DoD started
as a joke And in the words of one Denizen it intends to remain one

Sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked What does DoD
stand for Its not the Department of Defense is it Naturally a
Denizen who had watched the movie Top Gun a few times too many rose
to the occasion and replied

Thats classified we could tell you but then wed have to kill you

And the rest is history

A variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about
what DoD stands for Notable contributions and contributers where
known include

Daughters of Democracy DoD 23		Doers of Donuts
Dancers of Despair DoD 9		Debasers of Daughters
Dickweeds of Denver			Driveway of Death
Debauchers of Donuts			Dumpers of Dirtbikes

Note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be
limited only by the contents of ones imagination or dictionary file



                     The recmotophoto archive

First a bit of history this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck
Rogers organizing a recmotorcycles photo album Many copies were made
and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in
unknown locations Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate
for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album Bruce has not
only provided the disk space and ftp  email access but he has taken
the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive

Not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk
at their motorcycles A few nonphoto files are available from the
server too they include the DoD membership list the DoD Yellow Pages
the general recmotorcycles FAQ and this FAQ posting

Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how
to use the archive



Via ftp

cerritosedu 13015020021

Via email

The address is servercerritosedu  The commands are given in the body of the
message  The current commands are DIR and SEND given one per line  The
arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications  For
recmotophoto the file spec is DODfile  For example you can send

dir dod
send dodbrucetannergif
send doddodframeps

and youll get back 5 mail messages a directory listing 3 uuencoded parts
of brucetannergif and the dodframeps file in ASCII

Oh wildcards  are allowed but a maximum of 20 mail messages rounded up to
the next whole file are send  A send dodgif would send 150 files of
50K each not a good idea

A couple of comments Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so
why not drop him a note if you find the recmotophoto archive useful
Second since Bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind
of you to access it after normal working hours California time 



                      Patches What patches

You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches 
pins And your reaction was probably I want or Thats sick or
perhaps Thats sick I want

Well theres some good news and some bad news The good news is that
theres been an amazing variety of DoDlabeled widgets created The bad
news is that there isnt anywhere you can buy any of them This isnt
because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no
DoD store that keeps a stock All of the creations have been done by
individual Denizens out of their own pockets The typical procedure is
someone says Im thinking of having a DoD frammitz made theyll cost
xxxx with xxxx going to the AMA museum Anyone want one Then
orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
prepaid orders is produced and quickly consumed So if you want a
DoD doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one Or
produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all
this is anarchy in action

Heres a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise and
perpetrators Patches DoD11 pins DoD99 stickers DoD99
motorcycle license plate frames DoD216 tshirts DoD99 polo shirts
DoD122 Zippo lighters DoD99 LtF FtL belt buckles DoD99 and
patches DoD99 a second batch was done and rapidly consumed by
popular demand

All profits have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association
Motorcycle Heritage Museum As of June 1992 over 5500 dollars has been
contributed to the museum fund by the DoD If you visit the museum
youll see a large plaque on the Founders Wall in the name of Denizens
of Doom USENET The World complete with a DoD pin



Heres a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions

                        Organized  Rides

Summer 1992 saw more organized rides with the Joust in its third
year and the Ride  Feed going strong but without the Rollins Pass
trip due to the collapse of a tunnel  The East Coast Denizens got
together for the Right Coast Ride RCR with bikers from as far north
as NH and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of
North Carolina  The Pacific Northwest crew organized  the first Great
Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather GPNDG another successful excuse for
riding motorcycles and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
come to know so well  Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition

Also worth mentioning are The first recmotodirt ride held in the
MoabCanyonlands area of southern Utah Riders from 5 states showed up
riding everything from monster BMWs to ittybitty XRs to almostlegal
2strokes  And though its not an official as if anything could be
official with this crowd recmoto event the vintage motorcycle races
in Steamboat Springs Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
to gather  Theres also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah
European Denizens have staged some gathers too  Your ad here
