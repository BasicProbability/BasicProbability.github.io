Re Waving

I must say that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as I meet other bikers while
riding does a lot of good things to my mood While riding is a lot of fun by
itself theres something really special about having someone say to you Hey
its a great day for a ride Isnt it wonderful that we can spend some time
on the road on days like this with a gesture

Was sunny today for the first time in a week took my bike out for a spin down
to the local salvage yardbike shop ran into about 20 other people who were
down there for similar reasons theres this GREAT stretch of road on the way
down there no side streets lotsa leaning bends   Went on an
impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who 
I didnt know but who were my kinda people nonetheless

As a fellow commented to me while I was admiring his bike Hey its not
what you ride its that you ride As long as it has 2 wheels and an engine
its the same thing
