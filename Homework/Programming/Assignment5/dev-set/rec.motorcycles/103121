  What is a general rule of thumb for sobriety and cycling Couple hours 
 after you feel sober What Or should I just work with If I drink 
 tonight I dont ride until tomorrow

1 hrdrink for the first 4 drinks
15 hoursdrink for the next 6 drinks
2 hoursdrink for the rest

These are fairly cautious guidelines and will work even if you happen to 
have a low tolerance or body mass
I think the cops and Dont You Dare Drink  Drive tm commercials will 
usually say 1hrdrink in general but after about 5 drinks and 5 hrs you 
could very well be over the legal limit 
Watch yourself
