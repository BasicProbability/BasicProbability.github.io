Now maybe this isnt a big deal to some of you but it is to me  I was raised
in the South and part of my cultural heritage is waving at passersby  I
waved from the side of the road at passing cars when I drove I waved or
nodded or at least raised an index finger from the steering wheel  People
waved at me as I drove by 

I was raised in the South and I can attest that this is true  Why on
one particularly hot day as I was walking along the road some good
ole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer  Of course they were going
50 mph at the time

PS To prove this wasnt a fluke it happened to me again when I was out
riding on Wednesday an unsolicited wave Wow

Bikers wave to bikers the world over  Whether or not Harley riders
wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars
