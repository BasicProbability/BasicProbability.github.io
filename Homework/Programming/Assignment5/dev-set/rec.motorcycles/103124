Two questions that fascinate me

1 Why are rednecks called rednecks

The origin of the slang is probably a reference to a sunburned neck
often obtained while performing honest work outdoors  The neck is
specified to distinguish these people whose shirtprotected chest and
back are pale from the elitist wealthy who in their idiotic quest
for darker skin pigmentation as a badge of leisure time overdo it and
get fullbody sunburns


More like those who use their backs instead of their minds to make
their living who are usually ignorant and intolerant of anything outside
of their group or level of understanding

That sounds like an awfully closed minded intolerant attitude

Im not a redneck but    try a walk in their shoes first  Stereotypes
are usually of very limited value  Ive seen as many ignorant
selfrighteous open minded new age lovers of the great planet Earth
as I have ignorant red necks  I dont see a correlation I dont
believe that the redneck culture if you can call it that is
necessarily inferior or superior to any other  

I gotta have a beer Im making too much sense  Next thing you know
Ill be preaching tolerance    and Im a conservative
