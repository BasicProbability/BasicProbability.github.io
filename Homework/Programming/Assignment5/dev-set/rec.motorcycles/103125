Subject Carrying crutches was Re Living


In a previous article pooderrchlandvnetibmcom Don Fearn says


When I broke my right leg in two places not a motorcycle accident  a 
car accident who woulda thunk it I put my crutches on Gretchens rear
rack  Im getting the metal rod pulled out on Friday and going back on 
the crutches for six weeks  I think crutches on the handlebars sound more 
aesthetically pleasing  How did you attach them


	When I got my knee rebuilt I got back on the street bike ASAP I put
the crutches on the rack and the passenger seat and they hung out back a
LONG way Just make sure theyre tied down tight in front and no problemo
 
Go fast Take chances
