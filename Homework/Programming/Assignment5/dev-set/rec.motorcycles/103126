  By the way the shortlived Zephyr is essentially a GpZ 550
 Why was the Zephyr discontinued  I heard something about a problem with
 the name but I never did hear anything certain 

I dont think the 550 sold very well  most North Americans who ride a standard
rather than a sport bike usually want something bigger People walk into the
dealership look at the 550 and the 750 and say I might as well spring the
extra bucks for the bigger engine
