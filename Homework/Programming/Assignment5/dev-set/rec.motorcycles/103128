Subject Re Identify this bike for me

first I thought it was an RC31 a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing
but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it  Additionally

As someone who was told quite firmly by 2 Honda salesservice weenies
that there is no larger tank available for the Hawk I have a 91
Hawk with the puny 32 gal tank Id be very interested to know if
there is any decent aftermarket solution Id love to have at least
a 4 gal tank
