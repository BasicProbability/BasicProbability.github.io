 Two questions that fascinate me
     You are easily fascinated

 1 Why are rednecks called rednecks
     Why are you called a Welch
     OK its because they are often south or southeastern farmers
     whos necks are permanently damaged from sunburn  The sun
     you know what that is it never sets on the British Empire
     and never shines in Wales

This is a despicable LIE It was sunny on 3rd July 1958 from 1123am
to 11 37am I made a note of it Diaries are never wrong

 2 Why do they ride Harleys
     They dont  They drive in pickup trucks and shoot bikers

 Please enlighten me When I visited last the only answers I got 
 were incoherent splutterings
     You deserve more

neck Calamine lotion is good Im told

in a barrel
