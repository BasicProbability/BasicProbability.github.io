I havent heard Dr Demento in years  Does anyone know if it 
plays on any stations around Prov RI such as WBCN

Id love to pay for shipping and recording of the show too

The best BoringOldFarts prefer The Breeze 979FM Salt
Lake City Wonderfully catatonic I wanted to take the whole station
back with me in my flight bag Especially the girlie with the sexy
voice who did the Morning Show
