Hi Ravi

If you need a Harley we have lots to spare here All the yuppies
bought the best a couple  of years ago to pose at the swine
bar They rode a mile and walked the rest Called a taxi home and 
went back to the porsche So theres are loads going cheap with about
1 12 miles on the clock takes a while to coast to a halt

Cheers

Andy

PS You get a better class of people on GS500s anyway
