Subject Re Round Two

If Good Sam got 300 bricks delivered
first class postage to their door at their expense I bet they would change
their policies about mailing lists or about who can use their facilities
quickly 

And if the Lord God Almighty parted the sky and make a personal
appearance at their Board of Directors meeting they would also change
their policies  The odds are about equal

I am curious as to how many bricks I will have to send before this situatiion
is cleared up to my satisfaction  I suspect about 5  We shall see

Youll be extremely lucky if you ever get one through
