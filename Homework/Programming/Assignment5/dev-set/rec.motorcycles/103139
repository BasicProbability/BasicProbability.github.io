 Two years ago he went to work for CONRAIL as a mechanic
 On the EMD and GE power units train engines they NEVER
 EVER change the oil just the filters

I remember seeing an artical on largeengine oil

the life of the oil was to run through a heated
unpresurized chamber to allow water and volitiles
to boil off This made such longterm usage of
