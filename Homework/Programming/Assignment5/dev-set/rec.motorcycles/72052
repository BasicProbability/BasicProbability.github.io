It turns out that the trailer lights were not hooked up
to the truck  

Yep basic rule Never expect or believe turn signals completely
Around here and many other places people just dont signal at all
And sometimes the signals arent working  Sometimes they get left on
 
	The scary bit about this is the is the nonavailability of rear
lights at all Now living in the Netherlands Ive learned that the only
reliable indicators are those red ones which go on at both sides at once 
some people call them brake lights Once they light up expect ANYTHING
to occur in front of you  Its not just the Dutch though
 
	However I never realised how much I relied on this until I got 
caught a few times behind someone whose lights didnt work AT ALL Once 
Id sussed it out it wasnt so bad knowing it is half the battle but 
its a great way to find out that youve been following someone too 
closely  Now I try to check for lights all the time cos that split 
second can make all the difference though it shouldnt be necessary I 
know

	What used to peeve me in Canada was the cars with bloody red rear
indicators  Youd see a single red light come on and think Now is he
stopping but one brakelamp is not working or does he have those dumb bloody
red rear indicators  This being Survival 101 you have to assume hes
braking and take the appropriate actions until such time as the light goes
out and on again after which you can be reasonably certain its a bloody red
rear indicator
