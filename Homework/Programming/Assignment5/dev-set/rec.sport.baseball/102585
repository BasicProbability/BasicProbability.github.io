I say buy out Hendersons contract and let him go bag groceries  Next 
season youll be able to sign him for nothing  That goes for any bitching
ball player

I doubt Henderson would clear waivers  And if he did he would
instantly be signed for the major league minimum with Oakland picking
up the remaining 3 million tab

Some GMs value onfield performance too
