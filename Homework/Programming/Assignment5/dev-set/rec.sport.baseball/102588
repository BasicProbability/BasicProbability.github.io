Hi all

Ive been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or
two without access to really important information  I saw the 35 million
shoulder back on the DLHow long is he out for ie How many millionsinning
will he get this year  Nothing personal against Higuera mind you just
wondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current
big producers go over a relative pittance Please realize the term 
relative pittance can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball
salaries

Additional questions  I didnt get to see Bones pitch this springhow is
he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation

How is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third

Are they going to build a new stadium  When

Tom
