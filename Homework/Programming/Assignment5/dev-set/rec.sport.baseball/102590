Should be rescinded  The rules say baseball is a game between two teams of 
nine players each  Lets keep it that way

Last weeks Sports Illustrated has a couple of big articles on the designated
hitter  It is the 1993 baseball issue                                                                            Th                        is weeks Sports Illustrated
