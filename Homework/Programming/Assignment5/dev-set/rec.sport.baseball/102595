    The highest singlegame attendance was Game 5 of the 1959 World Series
 October 6 at the LA Coliseum  White Sox over Dodgers 10
 
    Gate  Officially 92706
 
    Largest regularseason game  78672 again in LA for the first
 game in the City of Angels  Opening Day April 18 1958 home opener
 anyway
 
    The Rockies might really nail the record
 
    The record attendance for a doubleheader is larger but since dhs are
 all but nonexistent nowadays why bother listing it

Wasnt there an 85000 New York at Cleveland game in the late 40s
