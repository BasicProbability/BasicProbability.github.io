Lets look at the effects of inflation on 1930s superstars salaries

I read once that the Babe made 80000 one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him

Lets assume he made that in 1928 Im not sure of the figures but I know
Im in the ballparkpun intended 

Today assuming a 4 yearly inflation rate which is an understatement if
not accurate his measly 80000 salary would be worth

FV  80000 x 1419931928
    80000 x 10465
    just over 1000000

Assuming inflation is average of around 5

FV  80000 x 1565
    almost 2000000

I didnt crunch these numbers beforehand

These numbers might lead one to believe that todays players are slightly 
overpaid  The Babe appears to have made then what todays average to above
average players make now  Perfectly accurate salary year of salary and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate but I dont 
think Im off by much
