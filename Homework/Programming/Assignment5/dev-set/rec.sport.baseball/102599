Everytime I have written on the net about the possibility of a
successfuls season by the Philadelphia Phillies I have gotten ripped
from everybody from Pittsburgh to Calcutta  But if all the
ignoramouses care to look at this weeks Baseball Weekly they will see
that Im not the only one who considers then as division winners  the
rest of the most respected baseball writers in the country do as well
 
 And these guys certainly know what theyre talking about  Every
 bozo from Pittsburgh to Calcutta will just have to sit up and take
 notice  This Phils team in an offensive juggernaut which is going
 to score a LOT of runs and put up a TON of hits on the scoreboard
 You people out there are going to be sick of seeing PHILLIES
 scattered all over every offensive league leaders category in the
 newspaper  These guys hit 304 through Spring Trainingwell before
 getting no hit yesterday  But they had a plane to catch 45 minutes
 after the game ended so theyre minds werent in it

Up to this point I really thought this had been written by a 
proSDCN antimediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks  Somebody like me for instance
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
original poster

 Now on top of the great offense they have a slightly above average
 pitching staff which has a lot of youth and promise  If the
 pitchers do their part and Mitch keeps blown saves to a minimum
 look for another pennant out in left field at the Vet

But then the scales were lifted from my eyes  Looks like Robert is
really being serious  Oh well

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS yet
finished at a frustrating sub500 level  The 1987 folks didnt 
ever amount to anything and neither will the 1992 squad IMHO

Any other parallels with previous years teams for this years
editions in the style of 1993 Braves  1971 Orioles
