Subject Re Mike Francesas 1993 Predictions
From gajarskypilotnjinnet Bob Gajarsky  Hobokenite

hmm  i thought francescas predictions ALWAYS hovered at or below
 500 especially in the nfl  not counting college football
 bowl day

hes a nice analyst for explaining past tense and for mapping out
 what plays teams might do  but for predicting the future he only
 looks good whne compared to russo
