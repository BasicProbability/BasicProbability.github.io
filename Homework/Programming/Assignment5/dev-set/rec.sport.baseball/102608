javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson
But has there ever in the history of baseball been a 22yearold or
younger rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
catchers in terms of defense and brought a 247 bat  Wasnt it 
Sandy Alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year
Not  Wasnt it Benito Santiago who was supposed to be that good
in his rookie year  Not

Hrm Sandy Alomar 24 year old rookie 132 games 290326418 Threw
out a few baserunners Benito Santiago 22 year old rookie 146 games
300324467 He threw out a few baserunners too Ivan Rodriguez
20 year old rookies 88 games 264276354 Didnt exactly suck
behind the plate

I can continue this thread with the others mentioned but you get
the point  You and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the 
seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies  Perhaps 
just perhaps  the management team of the pennantwinning Braves
knows something more than you do  And perhaps what they know is
that very very few 21 and 22year old rookies come up to the majors
and make an impact 

True Which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the
few Lopez season last year adjusted to major league equivalencies was
306330472 15 HRs How bad does he have to be behind the plate for that
to not be better than Olsons 238316328

I would not admire hitting against Ryne Duren because if he ever hit you
in the head you might be in the past tense
