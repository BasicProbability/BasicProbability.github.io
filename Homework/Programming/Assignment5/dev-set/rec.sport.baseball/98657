Subject Re Bring on the Os

I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati This would
help so that the Os could make some real free agent signings in the 
offseason Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right
now The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent
although I would prefer Parent 1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming
up faster in the Os hierarchy of the minors faster than expected Mike
Flanagan is trying for another comeback Big Ben is being defended by
coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot most came
in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half This
may be Bens year 
	I feel that while this may not be Mussinas Cy Young year he will
be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around August I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the Os need
Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense
better and play like he did in 91 The Os right now dont have many
lefthanded hitters Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cals return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant The 
rotation should be Sutcliffe Mussina McDonald Rhodes  Olson is an
interesting case Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
three pop outs You never know
The way I see the AL East this year with personal biases mixed in
Baltimore
New York
Toronto
Milwaukee
Cleveland
Boston
Detroit
The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind One of these 4 will
definitely win the division unless it snows in HellMaryland  I feel
that this Baltimores season to finally put everything together
