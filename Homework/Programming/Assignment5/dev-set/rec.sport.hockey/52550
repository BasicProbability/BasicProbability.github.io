When the Pens got Mario granted there was big publicity etc etc
and interest was immediately generated  Gretzky did the same thing for LA 
However imnsho neither team would have seen a marked improvement in
attendance if the team record did not improve  In the year before Lemieux
came Pittsburgh finished with 38 points  Following his arrival the Pens
finished with 53 76 72 81 87 72 88 and 87 points with a couple of
                          
Stanley Cups thrown in
      
It was at this point the Pens attendance was near capacity 34 out of 40 
sellouts yet they hadnt made the playoffs since 1982  How do you explain
a 6th place team breaking attendance records when they havent been to the
playoffs in 7 years  Mario Lemieux is the explanation IMHO  

You could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that
would make the playoffs is the reason 

Funny you should mention itthis is exactly the case I was going to make

But I think the reason is Lemieux
had a 168 point season and was the first nonGretzky to win the Hart and
Ross since 1980  People turned out to watch him play 

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team sucks 
But this is short term only I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last unless the team is a winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one  Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support
them  If they suddenly dropped to say 50 points youd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon  

Also the following year 8889 the Pens had 89 points not 87 

Ok  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book 

They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is 
true  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing
this Coffey late in 1987 and before they even had a playoff bound team
A doubling of attendance occured in 198485 from the previous year  An
increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that  The arrival
of Mario Lemieux is what did it 

You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it  But my point is that
it wasnt Mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come ie
a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar And
before anybody jumps in and says Im nitpicking and mincing words go back
and read from where this thread started

It might help to think about what would go through a fans mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens  Was it gee Mario Lemieux is
amazing Ill go watch him play or was it gee now weve got a kick
ass guy on our side Ill go watch him play  I think it was the latter

 Similar thing happened in LA   Before
Gretzkys arrival about 12000 per game  After constant sellouts  They
are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement
since Gretzkys first year there  How do you explain it  People are going
to see Gretzky  they certainly arent going to see a winner they havent
GOT a winner  Theyve had MUCH better teams in their past history than
they currently have yet they didnt draw as well then

I dont think this is accurate  The tickets sell but people dont go to
the games  I think this thread has already been discussedseason ticket
holders in LA dont always use their tickets  So in effect after the Kings
initial success following Gretzkys arrival 68 to 91 points same source
and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much  

Whether or not the Kings are a winner is debatable  I claim that since
Gretzkys arrival they have at the very least been competitiveI also claim
that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler
dynastybut thats another story and included only because I dont like
McNall  Anyway  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales etc  But as I said when the Kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
Forum even if the tickets were sold

I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky the player can transcend
winning as the major drawing power  

For the short term IMO  Although I think that its inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky simply because they
make people around them better

But winning sure as hell helps  

Well at least we are in full agreement here

This does not make Rogers point any more valid but the Jets arent

So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point couldnt resist

getting a HUGE jump in productivity yet they ARE getting a huge
jump in attendance  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne
They have the 17th best record in hockey it sure as hell isnt because
they are winning

Yes but they are doing no worse than last year  I think the same type of
reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at Winnipeg games  Its difficult to predict but do you think
that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels  I seriously doubt it because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without
Selanne

I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the 
CFLdid you leave it out because you dont know much about the CFL  If 
thats the case then fair enough but if it isnt the case then Im curious
to hear your explanation
