The Jets use the breakaway pass scheme to create a scoring sensation
in order to generate interest  If teams score as many or more goals
against Winnipeg when Selanne is on the ice as Winnipeg scores when
he is on the ice then I cant see how his contribution can be described
as impressive  

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on himRoger he is a FORWARD  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway  Lets put it another way  John Cullens 
is terrible  Whats your excuse for him  That his powerplay points dont
count  Neither do Selannes 

The object of the game is not to feed Selanne  it is 
to win  And feeding Selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way
to winning

Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning 

Pat Burns wouldnt have a goal suck like this on his team

Youre worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team

We DONT KNOW what Selanne does best  We do know what Jets management
wants  And again the object of the exercise is not to allow Selanne to
do what he does best it is to win hockey games

What he does best is scoreso I refer you to my comment above

As it is now Selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck  Did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  You would think the
Messiah had returned

Nope didnt see it  I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after
his goal
