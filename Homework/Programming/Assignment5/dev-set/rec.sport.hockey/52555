Subject And THEYRE OFF

Well I gotta tell ya

last nights Leafs game vs the Devils was a nailbitter LET ME TELL YOU
It was a well played game by BOTH teams I thought but according to the
Don and Ron it was the an offnight for the Leafs and the Devils 
were outplaying Toronto Well I BEG to differ

IMHO Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did His
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the Clark of old But not to take any of the
credit away from Gilmour

I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey WHY 
Well first look at their injury list which includes Cullen Ellet
Zezel Macoun Of course my question is thishow will the Leafs
fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well
so far

Second just look at their standings still second in defence
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month havent lost
at home in last 12 games 8 game undefeated streaketc
BTW am I wrong or was this Potvins first shutout I cant 
remember him having any as of yet

Well as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris
has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and
Toronto And the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to
see this one

Coming to the stretch and still a ROARIN
Go LEAFS Go
