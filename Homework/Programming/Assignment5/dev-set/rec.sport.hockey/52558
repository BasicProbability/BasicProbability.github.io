Also sprach sleggekeanucsmunca 

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send 4 players  15 million including Vin Damphousse
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa and Ottawa will give its first round pick to Montreal

If this is true it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose 1st overall  Can Ottawa afford Lindros salary

Personally I cant see Philli giving up Lindros  for anything
They didnt give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away
again  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a huge draw in
Phillie  and that he represents a successful future for the
franchise

Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players 15 from Montreal
for the pick

Two things

1 Didnt the trade deadline pass two weeks ago

2 The FLYERS would never ever EVER give up Lindros simple as that

Go Flyers Cup in 94
