     Looking at the way the divisions were realigned there are six teams each
in the Central Norris and Pacific Smyth divisions while there are seven
teams each in the Northeast Adams and Atlantic Patrick divisions  The
thought occurs to me that inherent in the realignment is expansion of one team
in the Central division and one team in the Pacific division although Ive
seen nothing published that indicates that

Actually when the NHL expansion committee was formed a couple of years back
before the Ottawa and Tampa Bay expansion John Zeigler stated at the time
that it was the NHLs expansion plan to grow to 28 teams 7 per division by
the turn of the century

During the Roman Era 28 was considered old

Last night during a Sharks broadcast Commissioner Bettman was
interviewed during the first intermission  He made no bones about it
the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
the current allotment of 26 are fully stable  This means that cities
looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
one team in some location fails or looks to relocate

This is good IMO  Theres no sense in expanding if it only means
more failing franchises are in the mold
