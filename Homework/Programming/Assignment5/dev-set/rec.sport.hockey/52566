From hammerlacsubuffaloedu Valerie S Hammerl


Hi  According to my always questionable newspaper theres a silver
dollar being minted in Canada the back of which commemorates the
anniversary of the Stanley Cup  Now I know full well what coins are
used every day in Canada  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket
change right now in fact  My question is since the loon is the only
dollar coin that I know is legal tender is this just a commemorative
coin with no monetary exchange value or what  Is it the sort of
thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet with no
chance of it being circulated  If it is an uncirculated coin whats
the current cost and whats its potential value  Just curious  If no
one knows Ill take this to socculturecanada and reccollecting or
whatever it is  Thanks again
