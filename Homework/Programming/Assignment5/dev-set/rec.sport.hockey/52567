But I think the reason is Lemieux
had a 168 point season and was the first nonGretzky to win the Hart and
Ross since 1980  People turned out to watch him play 

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans even if the team sucks 
But this is short term only I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last unless the team is a winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one  Pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support
them  If they suddenly dropped to say 50 points youd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon  

I disagree  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well  Very few fans real
istically expect the Kings to do well this year although I do and yet they
still go out to see Gretzky  This is the marketing strategy  selling the
game by selling the stars  that is employed by Baseball and notably the
NBA and this is the attitude that the new BettmanMcNall leadership is 
bringing to the league  They have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect 
examples of players that real fans know arent worth a damn and yet being
benificiaries of marketingoriented coaching strategies have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer the very fans the NHL wants to
attract that these players are indeed superstars

They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario that is 
true  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing
this Coffey late in 1987 and before they even had a playoff bound team
A doubling of attendance occured in 198485 from the previous year  An
increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that  The arrival
of Mario Lemieux is what did it 

It might help to think about what would go through a fans mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens  Was it gee Mario Lemieux is
amazing Ill go watch him play or was it gee now weve got a kick
ass guy on our side Ill go watch him play  I think it was the latter

It aint nearly so simple as this  The casual fan doesnt think about much 
at all  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that
McDonalds makes good hamburgers
 
I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the 
CFLdid you leave it out because you dont know much about the CFL  If 
thats the case then fair enough but if it isnt the case then Im curious
to hear your explanation

Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi
bilities has he  He was hyped initially as a superstar but outside of
one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintainenhance that assess
ment of his talents  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him 

cordially as always
