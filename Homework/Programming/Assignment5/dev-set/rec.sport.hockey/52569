Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne
on the ice can be blamed on himRoger he is a FORWARD  Winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway  Lets put it another way  John Cullens 
is terrible  Whats your excuse for him  That his powerplay points dont
count  Neither do Selannes 

Are you comparing Cullen to Salami  I would say that that is valid  If
Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami
stand around the other teams blueline when the puck is in his own end

The object of the game is not to feed Selanne  it is 
to win  And feeding Selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way
to winning

Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning 

Excuse me  Are the Jets playing 500 hockey  Let me checkyes  but just
barely  They have allowed more goals than they have scored  Sounds an
awful lot like Salamis  to me  Sounds like they would be just as well
off  or better  if he played the solid twoway game that our friends in
Finland claim he is capable of  But if he did that he wouldnt be chal
lenging for the league lead in goals would he  The BiPlanes might be
challenging for first however

Youre worried about Teemu when you have Glenn Anderson on your team

Now lets seeyou have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen  Whos
next  Mike Foligno

We DONT KNOW what Selanne does best  We do know what Jets management
wants  And again the object of the exercise is not to allow Selanne to
do what he does best it is to win hockey games

What he does best is scoreso I refer you to my comment above

Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid twoway game  I would have to say that this style
of contribution would be more conducive to winning  Or dont you 
think so

As it is now Selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck  Did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal  You would think the
Messiah had returned

Nope didnt see it  I was too busy watching Foligno jump up and down after
his goal

I dont believe it  You did compare him to Foligno  And I honestly hadnt
read this far

It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking  Your
contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you werent
trying to be merely argumentative

cordially as always
