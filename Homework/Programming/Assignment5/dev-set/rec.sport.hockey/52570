When talking about hockey broadcasters lets give a moment of silence to
remember the St Louis Blues great Dan Kelly Many of you may have heard
him in the late 60s and early 70s on CBS He used to do Hockey Night In
Canada intermissions with another recently deceased great Danny Gallivan
of the Canadiens

Agreed hereIll never forget Dan Kelly calling the playbyplay in the 87
Canada Cup  He was masterful

And Danny Gallivan will never be replaced even now when I watch HNIC I
remember his voicewhen I see an Al MacInnis or Al Iafrate hey whats with
these guys named Al who can shoot shot from the point I still think
blistering blastTHN had a tribute to Gallivan in the issue following his
death in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did  It
went 

It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check he said and 
will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition

Classic vintage Gallivan  Hes sorely missed  So heres to two of the best
there was and best that ever will be
