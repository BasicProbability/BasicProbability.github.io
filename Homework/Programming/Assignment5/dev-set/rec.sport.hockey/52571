Subject This years biggest and worst opinion


I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs biggest
surprises and biggest disappointments this year Now these are just
my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount Anyway
  
MVP  most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
      in terms of leadership cant win without him
  
Biggest surprise  the player who rose above expectation  the player
      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even
      if that new level doesnt necessarily warrant an allstar berth
      includes those players who at the outset of the season may not
      even have been in the teams plans
   
Biggest disappointment  the player from whom we expected more eg I
      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on
      offence brought by Demers shouldnt Savard have done better
