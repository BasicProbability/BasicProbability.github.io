I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs biggest
surprises and biggest disappointments this year Now these are just
my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount Anyway
  
Team                   MVP          Surprise    Disappointment

Edmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    Mellanby

Well since the Oilers didnt win a heck of a lot of games Im not sure
they deserve and MVP cant win without him  However Id suggest Kelly
Buchberger instead of Dave Manson who has had a brutal year his pick for
the AllStar game notwithstanding

As for biggest surprise Id say that Buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his breakthrough year for him last year so he didnt
really raise his game  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein one of the
callups from Cape Breton during the year  He was quite far down on the
depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects but made a big impact on
the team  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only 1  Those are decent
numbers for a thirdline player who was seemingly doomed to minorleague
oblivion  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli
I think hell be on the fulltime roster next year

As for biggest disappointment you could name any of the players the Oilers
dumped for lousy production this year Nicholls Gilchrist Tikkanen or
even Shayne Corson but Mellanby isnt far off
