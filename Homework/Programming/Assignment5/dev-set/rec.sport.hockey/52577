                        Team           Biggest       Biggest
Team                   MVP          Surprise    Disappointment

Boston Bruins           Oates          DSweeney     Wesley
Buffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette jinx
Calgary Flames          Roberts        Reichel       Petit
Chicago Blackhawks      Roenick        Ruuttu        Goulet

Chelios is by far the MVP on Chicago

Detroit Red Wings       Yzerman        Chaisson      Kozlov
Edmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    Mellanby

Manson by his own admission had a terrible yearthe Oilers
dont really have a team MVPby default it should go to Craig
MacTavish  Shjon Podein was the biggest surpriseTikkanen the
biggest disappointment

Hartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      Corriveau
Los Angeles Kings       Robitaille     Donnelly      Hrudey
Minnesota North Stars   Modano      Tinordinot expected back  Broten

Tinordi was back by midseason last yearand when he plays he is the MVP

Montreal Canadiens      Muller         Lebeau        Savard
New Jersey Devils       Stevens        Semak         MacLean
New York Islanders      Turgeon        Kingfinally Marois

King had a great year last year also

New York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev       Bourque

How can Kovalev be a surprise

Ottawa Senators         MacIver        Baker         Jelinek
Philadelphia Flyers     LindrosRecchi FedykGalley  Eklund

Fencesittinglook at Phillys record with Eric and without
there is no doubt  Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise

Pittsburgh Penguins     Lemieux        Toccheteven for him  Jagr

Tocchet had a near 100 point season in Philly with Mike Bullard as
his centerwhy shouldnt he be able to do that with Mario

Quebec Nordiques        SakicRicci    Kovalenko     Pearson
San Jose Sharks         Kisio          Gaudreau      Maley
St Louis Blues          Shanahan       CJoseph      Ron Sutter

Really Joseph deserves the MVP nod

Tampa Bay Lightening    Bradley        Bradley       CreightonKasper
Toronto Maple Leafs     Gilmour        Potvin        EllettAnderson
