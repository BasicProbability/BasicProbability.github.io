Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry let me first say that Ive been sort of
a Cherry fan for a whileadmittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly
but hes moreorless harmless  On Saturday however he crossed the lines of
good taste

According to Don the entire article wasnt perfect and there
were some shots by Frank Musil and Alpo Suhonen 
Don noted that Musil wasnt much of a player didnt
score many goals last year He also made fun of their names
One guy has a name like dog food the other like a laxitive
metaMusil

This is the best he can do  Gee Don tremendous amounts of professionalism
here  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with
this nonsensemaking fun of names  Its bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about European players but hes now resorted to making fun
of their names too  He sounded like an idiot much like he did last week
when he said that Teemu would never make it to his Rock em Sock em video
until he dropped the gloves

On the subject of realignment Don said that he liked the
new division names

Well what he said was that even though hes been around the league for quite
some time he still doesnt know whos where wrt conference and division
names  HELLO McFly  The names have been around for a couple of decades
or sohe also invited the audience to Name the teams in the Walesquick
quick Followed by Ah you dont know I dont know  

Sorry Don  Wrong on this one

Ron to Don I dont know wy I like you on your show
for 30 minutes I can hardly stand you on this show for 5

This was absolutely hilarious

Dons argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
goodunfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the NBA case  Serious moneyoh well hes never been one for objectivity
has he

Dons question to Gretzky

Wouldnt it be better
for you to change your friends so that they like the game than for
us to change the game for your friends

Now this I liked
