   Some sick part of me really liked that phrase
 
   Actually merely the threat of a long prison sentence even without
a beating can get most people to give in  Especially if its also
punctuated with a trip to the county jail where one just happens to get
locked up with all the drunkstonedcrazy folks that are too violent to be
left in cells with other people
