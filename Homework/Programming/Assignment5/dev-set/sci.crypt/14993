Subject Re Licensing of public key implementations

strnlghtnetcomcom David Sternlight writes

 I will provide one hint it is reported that RSA expressed puzzlement at
 their conference that nobody has asked for permission to use RIPEM to
 write a PGPcompatible program

This actually supports Bills speculation  IF there is a backdoor in
RSAREF and IF PKP is supported secretly by the NSA then it is more
than natural that they will welcome ANY publickey implementation that
uses RSAREF and will strongly oppose themselves against ANY
implementation that doesnt

I personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a
longprecision modular arithmetic library that comes in source but
of course the fact that I cannot see it means nothing

Vesselin
