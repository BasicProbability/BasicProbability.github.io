Subject Re disk safety measure

cuffellspotColoradoEDU Tim Cuffel writes

 There is no guarantee that the deleted space would be overwritten during
 optimization  Likely but no guarantee  A quicker and more secure method
 would be a batch file that overwrote all of your free space  For example
 fillbat
 	echo 1  out
 	fillbat
 This is off the top of my head  include stddisclaimerh

It is MUCH easier faster and probably even more secure to use Norton
Utilties 60 Im talking IBM PC here and to tell WipeInfo to a
clean the free disk space and b clean the slack space at the end of
the files Use to Government standard option for more careful
overwriting
