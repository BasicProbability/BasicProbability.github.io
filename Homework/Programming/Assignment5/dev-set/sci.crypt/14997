      I am looking for references to algorithms which can be used for
 password encryption Ie someone has a cleartext word runs it
 through the algorithm and it becomes some other sequence of symbols
 I want this algorithm to have the property that it is a next to
 impossible to reverse and b would take too long to try all possible
 words to see which one works even by use of a highspeed computer
 Please send references or ideas to mlevinhusc8harvardedu

The original oneway encryption I put into Multics about 1968 as suggested

by Joe Weizenbaum was invertible  An Air Force tiger team demonstrated 
this to me in May 1973  I then asked an expert who requested anonymity 
what I should use instead the experts suggestion was to treat the 
8byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm 
which is similar or identical to DES  This method or something stronger 
should take care of a  Issue b is discussed in compsecuritymisc 
longer passwords and quality control on what users can choose as passwords
are the common tactics
