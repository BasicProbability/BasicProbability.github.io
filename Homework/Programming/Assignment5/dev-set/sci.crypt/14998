For example if I had a program on my disk which created totally random
files looking like encrypted messages and could demonstrate that the file
in question could have been created by that program then my claim that
it was in fact created by that program must stand as true since Im
innocent unless someone can prove me wrong

HMMM that brings up a neat idea  

Unfortunately its SOOO neat I think I ought to patent it

So I cant tell you about it

Sorry
