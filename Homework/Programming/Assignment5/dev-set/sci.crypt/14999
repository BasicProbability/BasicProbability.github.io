How about this  I create a bunch of sets of random data and encrypt it  I 
keep only one of the sets of random data around to show that I encypt random
data for kicks  The rest I delete with their keys  I tell all my friends
I think this establishes reasonable doubt about the contents of any encrypted
files and my ability to provides keys  Since anyone could do this any law
that forces a user to provide keys on demand is worthless

The law is much worse than worthless  It gives police the power to put
innocent people in jail because they the police find something they dont
understand  Most police dont know what the return key does never mind the
difference between a core file and classified military secrets

There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something
is either  It could be uninitialized junk  The burden of proof is on the
user to show that its something a normal upstanding citizen should have  No
one should ever be put in that situation especially in America

Whats disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it to
provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical alleged child molester
or drug dealer or whatever bad thing is in style at the time  Basically most
people dont have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects

As an analogy its like they find a loose screw in your house and they
insist that youre building a bomb or machine gun  They ask you where it came
from like youd know and ask you to prove your claim  When you explain it
in such simple terms people may start to get the idea

As a matter of fact i do keep random files on my disk  The reason is
without specialpurpose hardware it takes a long time to generate good random
bits  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute which is
pretty conservative but over time thats more than i need

If you think about it theres no point in actually encrypting random data
because it just gives you different random data  If you want some data to
look like an encrypted file you just put an appropriate header on it  If
enough people do this some of them will be put in jail

When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys you can tell them its
just random junk although of course they wont believe you  While youre
sitting in jail you can take consolation in the fact that the government will
burn a few CPUyears trying to find something thats not there
