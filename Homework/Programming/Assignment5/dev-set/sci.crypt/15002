I guess we will have to wait for the time in the far future
when everyone uses such good crypto that the NSA has no job  Then the
agency will be disbanded and its files opened after the approprate
historical delay  

Youve overlooked a fundamental Truth

	both headcount and budget of any government agency are
	monotonic increasing functions

Given that Truth you need to look for what the agency can do to occupy
all those people and spend all that money when crypto is unbreakable

Perhaps they could talk the worlds telephone companies into making equipment
they could break into and tap

Maybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea
so that even the internal state of a process would be available for access
by wiretapping

Maybe
