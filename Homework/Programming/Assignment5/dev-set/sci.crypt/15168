This came up because I decided to configure up MITMAGICCOOKIE1 security
for X11R5 For this to work you need to stick some bits that an intruder
cant guess in a file readable only by you which X client applications
read They pass the bits back to the server when they want to establish a
connection


What I settled on was grabbing a bunch of traffic off the network
Basically I ran

	etherfind u x greater 0compress

and skipped over 10K of output then grabbed my bits As best I can tell
these are bits that can be expected to be reasonably uniformly distributed
and quite unguessable by an intruder

For your application what you can do is to encrypt the realtime clock
value with a secret key
