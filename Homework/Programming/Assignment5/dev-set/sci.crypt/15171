 Call me paranoid but this is the same kind of scare story which Dorothy
 Denning was citing while calling for the limitation of cryptography
 
 I doubt that DD is behind this  
 
 but I suspect that the FBI and maybe NSA are behind DD and those agencies
 could easily be mounting a nationwide campaign with our tax dollars to
 build up public outcry against digital communication  especially against
 unbreakable encrypted communication
 
 
 Whats going on here
 

Havent you read any of Noam Chomskys works A widely used information net
outside the control of the right people is unthinkable Hundreds of billions
of dollars will be spent to wipe it out sorry regulate and order it once
the major media and poitical powers wake up to the efect it can have

If you cant be bothered reading get the video Manufacturing Consent
