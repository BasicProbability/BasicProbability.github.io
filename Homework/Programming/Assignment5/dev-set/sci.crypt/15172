Subject Re Hard drive security for FBI targets


     1 Do a straight encryption of your keyrings and put the
        results with misleading names somewhere they wont be noticed
        eg in the windows directory nobody knows what half those
        files are

     2 Do a straight encryption of a BAT file that will decrypt
        the keyrings to RAMdisk and will set PGPPATH to point at it

     3 Set up another BAT file to decrypt and execute the first
        again on RAM disk Have it take the name of the target file
        as an argument so that there is no link between this file and
        the nonexistent batch file referred to by the rest of the
        system Comment it so it looks like a test script for fooling
        around with PGP Set PGPPATH to the PGP directory

     4 Leave the original keyrings that came with PGP in the
        directory with PGP a good indication that you are playing
        with but havent made serious use of PGP Add a set of keys
        with your name and a really simple passphrase Never use it
        or use it as your widely published key for lowsecurity
        email

     5 When needed run the second BAT file Make sure all
        intermediate and plainfiles are generated on RAMdisk

     6 When you hear the concussion grenade hit the power switch
        
        Cheers
                Marc
