There are a variety of waterproof housings I could use but the real meat
of the problem is the electronicshence this posting  What kind of
transmission would be reliable underwater in murky or even nighttime
conditions  Im not sure if sound is feasible given the distortion under
waterobviously direction would have to be accurate but range could be
relatively short I imagine 2 or 3  hundred yards would be more than enough

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications
For a review refer to ElectricalExperimenter March 1919 and June 1919

Rogers methods were used extensively during the World War and was
unclassified after the war Supposedly the government rethought this
soon after and Rogers was convieniently forgotten

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated by the square of the distance but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all Furthermore
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception the underground antennas would recieve virtually noisefree

IF you find this hard to believe then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless Tesla Tesla confirmed that Rogers methods
were correct while Hertzian wave theory was completely abberant


 ET   Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time Perhaps now his time comes
