In article 1pii04INNk6tzephyrgracecrinz you write
 Whats required to get onto the ACCESS bus The nice thing about the
 i2c is that most io requires one 8  16 pin DIL chip ie its cheap
 and easy Anyone can design a bus trouble is most buses require a
 host of interface chips and often onboard intelligence
