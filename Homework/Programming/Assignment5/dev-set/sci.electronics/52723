 Hi Im looking for a circuit that is called a Jacobs Ladder
 This little box is usually seen in scifi movies  It consists of 
 two curves of wire protruding into the air with little blue sparks
 starting at their base where the two wires are closer to each other
 moving up the wires to the top and ending in a small crackling noise 
 
 Could anyone supply me with the schematic for the innards of this box
 
 Thanks in advance
 Mike
