Subject WANTED DRAM Controller for use with MC68HC16

For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2
Meg banks of 16 bit data  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a
DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data  Its ok if the
controller doesnt handle bank switching  that part is easy

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National
Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook 1988 edition eg DP8429  I would
like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
implement in my circuit

BTW if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller Dallas
Semiconductor makes a neat chip the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer
Chip  It uses the SPI I2C bus and refreshescontrols up to 16Mx1 of DRAM
memory  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the
power is off  Price is 1175 from Dallas quan 1  I wish I could use
this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz too slow for me

Thanks in advance
