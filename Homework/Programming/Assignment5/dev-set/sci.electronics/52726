Subject An external timer

I was wondering if anyone knows of a chip that that is similar to
the internal timer 0 on the Intel 80C188  I want a timer that has
a Maxcount A and B and the output should the same as Intels timer  I called
Intel and they told me that they dont make such a chip  Any suggestions
are welcome  Thanks in advance
