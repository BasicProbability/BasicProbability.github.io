Subject AD board BUS SPEED probl


C Hi
C I have a 486DX266MHz computer to use with an AD board
C for data acquisition on an AT busIm having problems
C The AT bus runs at 125 MHz  correct  So there should
C be no bus speed conflict But I read somewhere that the
C new 486DX266 MHz CPU runs on a 33 MHz bus  is that for
C the local bus or the AT bus also  if so then I have a problem
C 
C When I run on nonturbomode the speed goes to 8 MHz and the
C AD doesnt work  Please mail your views  Thanks

The STANDARD AT bus ISA runs at 8MHz not 125 MHz but some 
nonstnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates but be careful since 
some boards dont work with faster than standard rates  For instance my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz

The fact that nonturbomode speed AD doesnt work is weird  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware bug  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus  FYI the AT bus 
operates asynchronously and is linked to the local bus via a bus 
interface which is one function that your chipset
