Subject Re PC Parallel IO


R JD ALL PC parallel ports that are compatable with the IBM standard
R JD including the original IBM adaptor are bidirectional

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BIDIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them RW select line of the circuit to Vcc  To make it bi  which 
I did  I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith  they were not ZenithBull Group at that time
