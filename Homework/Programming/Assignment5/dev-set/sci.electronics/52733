Hi there

I am looking for a high quality logstereo 10k pot for an audio 
preamplifier  The design specifies Alps RKGA2 10k AX2 but I cannot
find it anywhere  Any suggestions

The best pots around IMHO are made by Penny  Giles in the UK Their
basic model has a solid brass case and conductive plastic elements
matched to 05dB across the whole rotation The downside is that they
cost upwards of 50 quid each 

The PG pots are very good  The Alps ones are usually carried by
the same folks who run the Audio Amateur magazine  

Ill also recommend the Noble potentiometers if you dont mind weird
metric sizes on everything
