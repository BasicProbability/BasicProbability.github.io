Subject Re PC Based Layout Program

 The PADSZIP files contain subdirectories and have to be unzipped
 via pkunzip d Then an xcopy s to three floppies creates the disks
 needed to do the install

Im still not sure how this is supposed to work since the ZIP files
took up about 25Mb so it must be a tight squeeze on those floppies

However I managed to install PADS and Im pretty impressed  I created
a couple of schematics without problem but whenever I try to 
create a PCB layout from one of my circuits rather than the demos
it doesnt work  Im wondering if maybe a file isnt where it should
be

Can anyone who has a printed manual comment on whether the registration
fee is worth paying
