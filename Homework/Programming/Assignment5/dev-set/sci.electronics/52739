 Oh no youre not the only one Analogue scopes give you or me at
 least a fair idea of whats going on in a circuit Digital scopes
 seem to have a habit of inventing a sizable part of it Eg even
 when there are only a few samples per period our HP54510A displays a
 continuous waveform complete with nonexisting overshoots Ive
 waded through lots of manual pages and menus but I havent found yet
 how to turn this off It doesnt show which points have actually
 been measured as opposed to those which have been interpolated
 either

Perhaps youre using the wrong brand Sorry all HP fans but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
excellent gear

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition ie being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode

 
 Secondly I dont like menus I want to see all common functions
 with their own button Youll have guessed I love analogue Tek
 scopes Id choose a knob with printed legend over an onscreen
 display with updown buttons right away The single knob of most
 digital instruments never seems to be connected to the right function
 at the right moment
 

I agree with you here The only consolation is that manufacturers are
beginning to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus
However to be fair it seems that first time scope users our students
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a real scope 

 Last but not least you never know if the waveform displayed is old
 or recent noisy or just incoherently modulated heck you dont
 even know if it really looks the way its displayed Digital scopes
 only show you a tiny fraction of whats going on Most of the time
 there busy computing things

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek  their TDS320  which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO This instrument has
a 100MHz 500Mss spec meaning that it is always in real time
capture mode The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range The downer is that the instrument uses menus again but at
least they appear to be logically laid out
 
 There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital
 scope Looking at what happened before the trigger looking at rare
 events and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it
 
 
 Lets hope scope manufacturers are listening

One more thing about the new simpler front panels These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes other than students blowing up inputs is mechanical wear on these
switches I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments
