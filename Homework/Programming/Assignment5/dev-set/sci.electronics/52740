Subject Compressor Problem

I have a stereo compressorlimiter by 
Audio Logic Model MT66  The gates work
but the compressor seems to be gone on one
channel and very weak on the other  

Ill probably need an ocsilloscope to trace it
down no pun intended but if any one with
experience with this type of equipment could
point me in a certain direction as to where the 
circuit is most likely to fail Id sure appreciate it
