Subject Re Protection of serial RS232 lines

 Ive started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission
 over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments and have
 seen a variety of schemes for protecting the RS232 transceivers and
 the rest of the circuit from transients on the serial lines  Im
 left wondering what is the best way of doing this  How necessary is
 it
 stuff deleted
 What is the wisdom on this out there

From what I know protection is necessary esp if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment out of your control Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I dont think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke Even ethernet cards are
protected Ive looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube

But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings ie in
controlled environments it should be reasonably safe not to have
them

Suggestion look in the RS data book They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection Among them include the
LT1080 LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251 The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need optoisolators to work dont
ask me why Ive never used them before

Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector Two are listed in the
RS catalogue If you need additional info ie stock nos just email
me
