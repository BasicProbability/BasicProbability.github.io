There is at least one opticallyisolated RS232 transceiver chip  I
dont remember where I saw it

RS Components they exist in Australia and the UK Dont know about the US have
little chips called Isolated MAX 250 and 251 They give you isolated RS232 from
a single 5V supply External components are 4 caps 4 optoisolators a diode
and an isloting transformer They go up to 192K baud
