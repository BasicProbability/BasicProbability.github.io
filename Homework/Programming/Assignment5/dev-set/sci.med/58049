 Forget about total cholesterol when assessing health risk factors
 Instead use a relationship between LDL and HDL cholesterol
 
 If your LDL is       You need an HDL of at least
 
       90                 35
      100                 45
      110                 50
      120                 55
      130                 60
      140                 70

Gee what do I do  My LDL is only 5060 and my HDL is only 2325
I must be risking something but Is it the same risk as those with 
very high LDL

 If your triglycerides are above 300 and your HDL is below 30 the
 drug of choice is gemfibrozil Lopid taken as a 600mg tablet
 thirty minutes before your morning and evening meals

What about exercise and a lowfat diet  What are the longterm 
effects of this drug
