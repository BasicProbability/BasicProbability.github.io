While youre right that the S vertebrae are attached to each other
the sacrum to my knowledge can be adjusted either directly or
by applying pressure on the pubic bone
 
Ron youre an endless source of misinformation  There ARE no sacral
vertebrae  There is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine
It is a single solid bone except in a few patients who have a
lumbarized S1 as a normal variant  How do you adjust a solid bone
break it  No dont tell me I dont want to know
