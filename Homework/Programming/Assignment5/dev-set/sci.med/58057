    When I was a kid in primary school I used to drink tons of milk without
 any problems  However nowadays I can hardly drink any at all without
 experiencing some discomfort  What could be responsible for the change

OOPS My original message died Ill try again
I always understood perhaps wrongly that the bacteria in our digestive
tracts help us break down the components of milk Perhaps the normal flora of 
the intestine changes as one passes from childhood
Is there a pathologist or microbiologist in the house
