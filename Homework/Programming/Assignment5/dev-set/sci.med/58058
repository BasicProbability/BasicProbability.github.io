How long does it take a smokers lungs to clear of the tar after quitting 
Does your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it take
a considerable amount of time for that to happen

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without
doing a lot of autopsies  The second question is something thats been
known for some time  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting
smoking a persons risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the
person who never smoked assuming you do not get lung cancer in the
interim  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per
day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a nonsmoker  Still
rather low overall but significant  Personally Id be more concerned
about heart disease secondary to smoking  its much more common and
even a small increase in risk is significant there
