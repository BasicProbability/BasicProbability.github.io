 While youre right that the S vertebrae are attached to each other
 the sacrum to my knowledge can be adjusted either directly or
 by applying pressure on the pubic bone
  
 Ron youre an endless source of misinformation  There ARE no sacral
 vertebrae  There is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine
 It is a single solid bone except in a few patients who have a
 lumbarized S1 as a normal variant  How do you adjust a solid bone
 break it  No dont tell me I dont want to know
  
Oh come now surely you know he only meant to measure the flow of
electromagnetic energy about the sacrum and then adjust these flows
with a crystal of chromium applied to the right great toe  Dont
you know anything
