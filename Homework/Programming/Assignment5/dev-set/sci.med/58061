Subject ringing ears



A friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing  The ringing is so loud
that she has great difficulty sleeping at night  She says that she hasnt 
had a normal nights sleep in about 6 months she looks like it too 
This is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on antidepressants

The ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago  She is quickly losing
sleep social life and sanity over this

Does anyone know of any treatments for this  Any experience  Coping
mechanisms  Any opinions on the antidepressant drugs
