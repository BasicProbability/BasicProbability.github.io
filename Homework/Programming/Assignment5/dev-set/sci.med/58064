Subject Re Analgesics with Diuretics

In article ofklve00WB2AvUktOandrewcmuedu Lawrence Curcio lc2bandrewcmuedu writes
I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle achesback aches that
combine aspirin with a diuretic

You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such
The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual
syndrome ostensibly to treat headache and bloating simultaneously
Theyre worthless

The idea seems to be to reduce
inflammation by getting rid of fluid Does this actually work 

Thats not the idea and no they dont work
