	I have a very oily skin  My problem is when I wash my face it becomes
oily in half an hour  Especially in the nose region  Is this an illness  How
can I prevent it from occuring in such short time  Is there a cleanser out
there that will do a better job  that is after cleaning my face wont become
oily in such a short time

I dont think thats a problem  My face is quite oily too  I had a moderate
acne problem for many years  I then found that if I vigorously scrub my face
with a nail brush and soap Irish Spring twice a day the acne was not a 
problem  I can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min
dont ask  but acne is not a real problem anymore
