JL From jlecherpbsorg
JL  I would not classify a mild headache that was continuous for weeks
JL  as migraine even if the other typical features were there eg
JL  unilateral nausea and vomiting photophobia  Migraines are by
JL  common agreement episodic rather than constant
JL 
JL Well Im glad that you arent my doctor then or Id still be suffering
JL Remember I was tested for any other cause and there was nothing Im
JL otherwise very healthy
JL The nagging pain has all of the qualifications its on one side and
JL frequently included my entire right side right arm right leg right eye
JL even the right side of my tongue hurt or tingled Noise hurt light hurt
JL thinking hurt When it got bad I would lose my ability to read

The differential diagnosis between migraine and nonmigranous pain
is not always important because some therapies are effective in
both eg tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen  Other
therapies may be more specific betablockers such as propranolol
work better in migraine than tensiontype headache

The most important thing from your perspective is that you got
relief  Also please understand that a diagnosis other than
migraine does not necessarily mean psychogenic I suspect that
organic factors play as large a role in tensiontype headache as in
migraine
