Gordon your experience is valid for many but not all  The
fact that you know a few people who have been overweight and are
now stable at a lower normal or just less weight does not
contradict the observation that only 510 per cent can maintain
ideal weight with current technology

Actually the observation is that only 510 of those who seek help
from your socalled diet evangelists can maintain their weight  I
happen to agree with Keith Lynch that there are many people who can
and do lose weight on their own and who are not reflected in the
dismal failure rate that is often quoted

Wasnt there a study where a researcher asked a more general population
perhaps some part of a university community about weight loss and heshe
found that a much higher percentage had lost and maintained 

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study search for life
events in any recent version of Adiposity 101

The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have
lost weight and kept it off is that we dont know what caused
the weight gain in the first place  This is critical because
someone who gains weight because of something temporary drug
effect life event etc may appear successful at dieting when
the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary
condition that caused the weight gain
