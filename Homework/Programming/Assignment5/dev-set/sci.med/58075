 a friend of mine has a very severe cause of jiggers 
 for over a year now  they cause him a lot of pain

 i recently read i dont know where about a possible
 cure for jiggers  does anyone have any information on
 this  i cant remember the name of the treatment or
 where i read it


Ill probably get flamed for this but when I was a kid we would go to
my uncles cabin on Middle Bass Island on Lake Erie We always came home
with a nasty case of jiggers large red bumps where the buggers had
burrowed into the skin My mother would paint the bumps with clear
finger nail polish This was repeated daily for about a week or so The
application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of
the skin All I can say is it worked for us One word of caution
though Putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell

If I do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me
toast
