CONSTANTS AND EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATIONS

    This list was originally compiled by Dale Greer Additions would be
    appreciated

    Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
    blueskying purposes

    Unix systems provide the units program useful in converting
    between different systems metricEnglish etc

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance v is velocity a is acceleration t is time
	Additional more specialized equations are available from

	For constant acceleration

	    v  v0  at
	  v2  2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder space colony etc of radius r and
	    rotation period t

	For circular Keplerian orbits where
	    Vc	  velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc  escape velocity
	    M	  Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	  Gravitational constant defined below
	    u	  G  M can be measured much more accurately than G or M

	    r	  radius of orbit measured from center of mass of system
	    V	  orbital velocity

	       of a circular orbit with the same semimajor axis

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit

	velocity which reduces the energy a bit
