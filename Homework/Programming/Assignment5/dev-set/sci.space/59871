    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCISPACESCIASTRO

    INTRODUCTION

    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups scispace and sciastro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting send email to
leechcsuncedu Jon Leech

    If you dont want to see the FAQ add Frequently Asked Questions to
your KILL file for this group if youre not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject youre out of luck

    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQfaq

    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here The
point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old
answers Better to build on top than start again Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the 100th time References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization

    Questions fall into three basic types

    1 Where do I find some information about space

    Try your local public library first The net is not a good place to ask
    for general information Ask INDIVIDUALS by email if you must There
    are other sources use them too The net is a place for open ended
    discussion

    2 I have an idea which would improve space flight

    Hope you arent surprised but 9999 out of 10000 have usually been
    thought of before Again contact a direct individual source for
    evaluation NASA fields thousands of these each day

    3 Miscellanous queries

    These are addressed on a casebycase basis in the following series of
    FAQ postings


    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE

    Read newsannouncenewusers if youre on Usenet
    Minimize cross references Do you REALLY NEED to
    Edit Subject lines especially if youre taking a tangent
    Send mail instead avoid posting follow ups 1 mail message worth
	100 posts
    Internet mail readers send requests to adddrop to SPACEREQUEST
	not SPACE
    Read all available articles before posting a followup Check all
	references
    Cut down attributed articles leave only the points youre
	responding to remove signatures and headers Summarize
    Put a return address in the body signature of your message mail
	or article state your institution etc Dont assume the
	reply function of mailers will work
    Use absolute dates Post in a timely way Dont post what everyone
	will get on TV anyway
    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping
	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals
	use carriage returns

    CREDITS

    Eugene Miya started a series of linked FAQ postings some years ago which
    inspired and was largely absorbed into this set

    Peter Yee and Ron Baalke have and continue to spend a lot of their own
    time setting up the SPACE archives at NASA Ames and forwarding official
    NASA announcements

    Many other people have contributed material to this list in the form of
    old postings to scispace and sciastro which Ive edited Please let me
    know if corrections need to be made Contributors Ive managed to keep
