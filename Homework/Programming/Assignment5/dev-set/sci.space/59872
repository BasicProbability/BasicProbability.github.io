NETWORK RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
    computers so much of the material below may not apply to you In
    general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three
    categories Internet Usenet or BITNET Electronic mail may be sent
    between these networks and other resources available on one of these
    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
    special servers

    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
    several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them

    One mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central
    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list In
    addition to the general lists for space called SPACE Digest for
    Internet users and SPACE on BITNET there are a number of more
    specialized mailing lists described below

    A second mechanism is Usenet netnews This is somewhat like a bulletin
    board operating on each system which is a part of the net Netnews
    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
    group name The groups dealing most closely with space topics are
    called scispacenews scispace scispaceshuttle sciastro
    and talkpoliticsspace Contributors post submissions called
    articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends
    it to other nearby machines Similarly articles sent from nearby
    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so
    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet
    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
    posted

    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet scispace group into Internet and
    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa the other Usenet groups are not
    accessible as mailing lists If you can receive netnews its more
    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
    it the preferred option

MAILING LISTS

    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list and is now being run by the
