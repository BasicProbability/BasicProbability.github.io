ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES DATA ETC


INTRODUCTION

    A wide variety of images data catalogs information releases and
    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net
    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access while the
    remainder support some form of file transfer Many sites are listed as
    providing anonymous FTP This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on
    the Internet Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP
    directly but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via
    email Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmaildecwrldeccom
    or bitftppuccprincetonedu and the servers will send you instructions
    on how to make requests

    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames
    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center

    Dont even ask for images to be posted to the net The data volume is
    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it


VIEWING IMAGES

    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
    large and I wont attempt to cover common formats GIF etc here To
    read PDS and VICAR and many other formats on Unix systems running X
    use XV 211 available by anonymous FTP from exportlcsmitedu
    1824012 in contribxv211tarZ and the other standard X11 FTP
    sites

    The FAQ for the Usenet group altbinariespictures discusses image
    formats and how to get image viewing software A copy of this document
    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at
    pitmanagermitedu 1872158 in directory

ONLINE ARCHIVES

    NASA AMES

    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via
    anonymous FTP or an email server These archives include many images and
    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list NASA press
    releases shuttle launch advisories and mission status reports Please
    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis

    FTP users should connect to amesarcnasagov 128102183 and look in
    pubSPACE pubSPACEIndex contains a listing of files available in the
    archive the index is about 200K by itself

    To access the archives by email send a letter to
    archiveserveramesarcnasagov or amesarchiveserver In the
    subject of your letter or in the body use commands like

	send SPACE Index
	send SPACE SHUTTLEss012391

    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important All are in
    caps Only text files are handled by the email server at present use
    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this
    section for images or programs

    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter Saturn and Uranus CDROM image
    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories The
    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis Thousands of images are
    available in these collections

    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format The VICAR directory
    contains Magellan images in VICAR format these are also available in
    the GIF directory A PC program capable of displaying these files is
    found in the IMDISP directory see the item VIEWING IMAGES below

    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to
    contact their public affairs officers this may be useful when pursuing
    specific information Its in MISCmediaguide

    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee

    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM

    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and
    provides uniform access to groundbased and spacebased astronomy data
    from NASA data centers across the country It currently has over 140
    data catalogs of radio infrared optical UV and Xray data which can
    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog The ADS
    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results In addition
    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to
    query over 125000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors
    keywords title words or abstract text words

    ADS use requires direct Internet access For more info and to sign up to
    become a user email adscuadscoloraduedu The Users Guide and
    QuickStart Guide are available by anonymous FTP to saoftpharvardedu

    NASA SPACELINK

    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center
    in Huntsville Alabama The system is specifically designed for
    teachers The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current
    and historical information on NASA aeronautics space research and
    technology transfer information Also included are suggested classroom
    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a
    number of scientific principles Unlike bulletin board systems NASA
    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers However it
    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments
    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail Messages are answered
    electronically even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by
    mail Messages are generally handled the next working day except during
    missions when turnaround times increase The mail system is closedloop
    between the user and NASA

PLANETARY MAPS

    The USGS address for maps of the planets is

    US Geological Survey
    Distribution Branch
    Box 25286 Federal Center Bldg 41
    Denver CO 80225

    Maps cost 240 to 310 per sheet a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets

    The best global maps of Mars based on Viking images are 115000000
    scale in 3 sheets These maps are

    I1535 2 sheets only  relief albedo names
    I1535
    I1618 3 sheets  relief names
    I2030 3 sheets  relief topographic contours
    I1802ABC 3 sheets  geology

    There are many other maps as well 30 sheets at 15000000 scale in
    relief albedo geology photomosaic forms not all 30 sheets available
    in all formats 140 sheets at 12000000 scale as photomosaics of the
    whole planet about 100 sheets of interesting sites at 1500000 scale
    in photomosaic format and lots of special sheets

    Then there are maps of Mercury Venus the Moon the four Galilean
    Satellites six moons of Saturn and five of Uranus Phil Stooke

COMETARY ORBIT DATA

    The Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and the Minor Planet
    Center announce the sixth edition of the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits in
    IAU Circular 4935 The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent
    all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long
    Nonsubscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for 1500
    while the cost to subscribers is 750 The basic catalogue in ASCII
    along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate
    ephemerides is available on MSDOS 525inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of
    7500 the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor The catalogue
    alone is also available by email for 3750 or on magnetic tape for
    30000

    Except for the printed version of the catalogue the various magnetic
    media or email forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion
    nonsubscribers It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may
    not be available to nonsubscribers or that their prices may be more
    expensive than those given Mail requests for specific information and
