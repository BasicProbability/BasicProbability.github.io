    CAREERS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY

    In 1990 the Princeton Planetary Society published the first edition of
    Space Jobs The Guide to Careers in SpaceRelated Fields The
    publication was enormously successful we distributed 2000 copies to
    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in
    Great Britain Australia and Ecuador Due to the tremendous response to
    the first edition PPS has published an expanded uptodate second
    edition of the guide

    The 40page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and fulltime job
    opportunities as well as graduate school programs The second edition of
    Space Jobs features strategies for entering the space field and
    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms NASA and
    nonprofit organizations The expanded special section on graduate
    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing
    to space policy Additional sections include tips on becoming an
    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia as
    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space

    DCX SINGLESTAGE TO ORBIT SSTO PROGRAM

    SDIs SSRT Single Stage Rocket Technology project has funded a
    suborbital technology demonstrator called DCX that should fly in
    mid1993 Further development towards an operational singlestage to
    orbit vehicle called Delta Clipper is uncertain at present

    An collection of pictures and files relating to DCX is available by

    HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON

    Official names are decided by committees of the International
    Astronomical Union and are not for sale There are purely commercial
    organizations which will for a fee send you pretty certificates and
    star maps describing where to find your star These organizations have
    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
    assign are not used by anyone else Its also likely that you wont be
    able to see your star without binoculars or a telescope See the back
    pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
    info one such organization may be found at

	Fusion as Electric Propulsion Robert W Bussard Journal of

	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
	    systems with propulsion thrustpowerinputpower ratio the
	    thrustpower gain Gt much greater than unity Gain values
	    of conventional solar fission electric propulsion systems are
	    always quite small eg Gt08 With these highthrust
	    interplanetary flight is not possible because system
	    acceleration at capabilities are always less than the local
	    gravitational acceleration In contrast gain values 50100
	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts which offer
	    highthrust flight capability One performance example shows a
	    533 day 344 powered 189 coast oneway transit time with

	    demonstrated a 1010 neutron flux with their device back in

	PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications by
	Paul M Koloc Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion
	Energy special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY March 1989

	    Aneutronic energy fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels then high power densities
	    and very compact realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible its unique pressure
	    efficient structure exceptional stability fluidmechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multigigawatt electric output size Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost I
	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously Bob
	    Hirsch the primary proponent of the Tokamak has recently
	    declared Kolocs PLASMAKtm precursor the spheromak to be one
	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
	    than Tokamak Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority the
	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models balllightning with solid
