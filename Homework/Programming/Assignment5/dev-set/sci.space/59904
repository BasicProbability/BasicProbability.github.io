SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS LAUNCH SCHEDULES TV COVERAGE

    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM

    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group scispaceshuttle
    and Ken Hollis gandalfproelectricctscom posts a compressed version
    of the shuttle manifest launch dates and other information
    periodically there The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE
    archive in SPACEFAQmanifest The portion of his manifest formerly
    included in this FAQ has been removed please refer to his posting or
    the archived copy For the most up to date information on upcoming
    missions call 407 867INFO 8674636 at Kennedy Space Center

    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to scispacenews
    frequently


    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov

    The Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual ASC GC 2102
    says

	During the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an Iloaded Vrel sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved Then the tilt maneuver roll program
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative qalpha which in turn alleviates structural loading Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort
	maneuver complexity improved Sband look angles and crew view of
	the horizon The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff MECO target
	in second stage

    This really is a good answer but its couched in NASA jargon Ill try
    to interpret

    1	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling

    2	Then we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the
	relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly
	negative angle a negative qalpha	This causes a little bit of
	downward force toward the belly of the Orbiter or the Z
	direction and this force alleviates structural loading
	We have to be careful about those wings  theyre about the
	most delicate part of the vehicle

    3	The new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didnt roll performance gain

    4	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers the Return To Launch Site decreased abort maneuver
	complexity

    5	The new attitude improves the ability for groundbased radio
	antennae to have a good lineofsight signal with the Sband radio
	antennae on the Orbiter improved Sband look angles

    6	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a
	helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine

    7	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east
	usually  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit  Remember
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit

    This all begs the question Why isnt the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches  one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust  You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam  Watch for the difference between the top
    Orbiter side and the bottom External Tank side of the stack The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn Vs  A side note the
    Saturn Vs also had a roll program  Dont ask me why  Im a Shuttle
    guy

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics	He added that the roll
    maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack qalpha within a tight tolerance  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a gradlevelmath
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one fourelement
    array


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite If you have access to a satellite
    dish you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R Transponder 13 CBand 72
    degrees West Longitude Audio 68 Frequency 3960 MHz F2R is stationed
    over the Atlantic and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west During events of special interest eg
    shuttle missions SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers

    If you cant get a satellite feed some cable operators carry SELECT
    Its worth asking if yours doesnt

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to scispacenews Generally it carries press
    conferences briefings by NASA officials and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material associated with SPACELINK when missions
    are not being covered

	W1AW		 28590  21390  14290  7290	3990

    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 14664 a special event station on the
    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information

    W1AW also transmits on 147555 18160 No mission audio but they
    transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 UTC

    Frequencies in the 1020m bands require USB and frequencies in the 40
    and 80m bands LSB Use FM for the VHF frequencies
