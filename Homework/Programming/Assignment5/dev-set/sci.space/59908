CONTACTING NASA ESA AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIESCOMPANIES

Many space activities center around large Government or International
Bureaucracies	In the US that means NASA  If you have basic information
requests eg general PR info research grants data limited tours and
ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT typically resumes should be ready by Jan  1
etc consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions

EMail typically will not get you any where computers are used by
investigators not PR people The typical volume of mail per Center is a
multiple of 10000 letters a day Seek the Public Information Office at one
of the below this is their job

NASA The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the
civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government
It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet
post such as the military Department of Defense  Its 20K employees
are civil servants and hence US citizens  Another 100K contractors
also work for NASA

	The heavies in planetary research probes and other unmanned
	projects they also had a lot to do with IRAS They run Voyager
	Magellan Galileo and will run Cassini CRAF etc etc For
	images probe navigation and other info about unmanned exploration
	this is the place to go

	JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California
	Institute of Technology unlike the NASA centers above This
	distinction is subtle but critical JPL has different requirements
	for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires For instance in
	the latter an SF 171 is useless Employees are Caltech employees
	contractors and for the most part have similar responsibilities
	They offer an alternative to funding after other NASA Centers
