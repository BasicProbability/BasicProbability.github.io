UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES  MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    ASUKA ASTROD  ISAS Japan Xray astronomy satellite launched into
    Earth orbit on 22093 Equipped with largearea widewavelength 120
    Angstrom Xray telescope Xray CCD cameras and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters


    CASSINI  Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe Cassini is a joint
    NASAESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IVCentaur in October of 1997
    After gravity assists of Venus Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004 Upon
    arrival the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn Near the end of this initial orbit the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface After the completion of the Probe mission the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus Dione and Enceladus The objectives of the
    mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere
    rings and magnetosphere conduct closeup studies of Saturns
    satellites and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini 16251712 the
    first director of the Paris Observatory who discovered several of
    Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens 16291695 who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturns rings

    GALILEO  Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe in transit Has returned
    the first resolved images of an asteroid Gaspra while in transit to
    Jupiter Efforts to unfurl the stuck HighGain Antenna HGA have
    essentially been abandoned JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression JPEGlike for images lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments which should allow the mission to achieve
    approximately 70 of its original objectives

    HITEN  Japanese ISAS lunar probe launched 12490 Has made
    multiple lunar flybys Released Hagoromo a smaller satellite
    into lunar orbit This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon


    MAGELLAN  Venus radar mapping mission Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution Currently 493 collecting a global gravity
    map


    MARS OBSERVER  Mars orbiter including 15 mpixel resolution camera
    Launched 92592 on a Titan IIITOS booster MO is currently 493 in
    transit to Mars arriving on 82493 Operations will start 1193 for
    one martian year 687 days


    TOPEXPoseidon  Joint USFrench Earth observing satellite launched
    81092 on an Ariane 4 booster The primary objective of the
    TOPEXPOSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean


    ULYSSES European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles Launched in late 1990 it carries particlesandfields
    experiments such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers etc but no camera

    Since no humanbuilt rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane it went to Jupiter instead and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravityassist
    manuver in February 1992 This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic It will pass over the Suns south pole
    in the summer of 1993 Its aphelion is 52 AU and surprisingly its
    perihelion is about 15 AU thats right a solarstudies spacecraft
    thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is

    While in Jupiters neigborhood Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment For a short summary of these results see
    Science V 257 p 14871489 11 September 1992 For gory technical
    detail see the many articles in the same issue
