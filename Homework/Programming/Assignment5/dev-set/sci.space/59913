	The title says all Starts of with the basics and works its way up
	Very good It has a companion article

    M Minovitch Utilizing Large Planetary Perubations for the Design of
    DeepSpace SolarProbe and Out of Ecliptic Trajectories Technical
    Report 32849 JPL Pasadena Calif 1965

	You need to read the first one first to realy understand this one
	It does include a short summary if you can only find the second

	Contact JPL for availability of these reports

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTHIMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests

    D  S  S  c  K  W	     crater diameter in km

     g	  e  t		      Earth where g  98 ms2 and g	is the surface

			      gravity of the target body This scaling is
			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
			      other bodies

			      rock on the continental shields

    C			     crater collapse factor 1 for craters  3 km
			      in diameter 13 for larger craters on Earth

							    134

			      given diameter d velocity v and projectile
			      density delta in CGS units delta of around 3
			      gcm3 is fairly good for an asteroid

    An RMS velocity of V  20 kmsec may be used for Earthcrossing
    asteroids

    Under these assumptions the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona 113 km diameter would have been about 40 meters in
    diameter

    More generally one can use after Gehrels 1985

    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy
    diameter km		       impactsyear	    51020 ergs

      01	       100 000		     104		103

    assuming simple scaling laws Note that 51020 ergs  13 000 tons TNT
    equivalent or the energy released by the Hiroshima Abomb

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easytofind sources of map projections are the Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica particularly the older volumes and a tutorial appearing
    in Graphics Gems Academic Press 1990 The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    spherical trig formulae also appear as do digitallyplotted examples

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyders USGS publication Map ProjectionsA Working Manual USGS
    Professional Paper 1395 This contains detailed descriptions of 32
    projections with history features projection formulas for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth and numerical test cases Its a
    neat book all 382 pages worth This ones 20

    You might also want the companion volume by Snyder and Philip Voxland
    An Album of Map Projections USGS Professional Paper 1453 This
    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants Formulas are
    in the back example plots in the front 14 250 pages

    You can order these 2 ways The cheap slow way is direct from USGS
    Earth Science Information Center US Geological Survey 507 National
    Center Reston VA 22092 800USAMAPS They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money Expect a 68 week turnaround time

    them and tell them what you want Theyll quote a price you send a
    check and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up
    for you Add about a 34 service charge plus shipping

    A perhaps more accessible mapping article is

	R Miller and F Reddy Mapping the World in Pascal
	Byte V12 14 December 1987

	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections A
	demo program CARTOGPAS and a small 6000 point coastline data
	is available on CompuServe GEnie and many BBSs

    systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations
    Included were an ephmeris a satellite track and speech synthesis
    software The ephmeris sky6 is available within ATT and to sites
    possessing a Unix source code license The program is regarded as Unix

    THREEDIMENSIONAL STARGALAXY COORDINATES

    To generate 3D coordinates of astronomical objects first obtain an
    astronomical database which specifies right ascension declination and
    parallax for the objects Convert parallax into distance using the
    formula in part 6 of the FAQ convert RA and declination to coordinates
    on a unit sphere see some of the references on planetary positions and
    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this and
    scale this by the distance

    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog
    sources listed in FAQ section 3 or The Catalogue of Stars within 25
    parsecs of the Sun in pubSPACEFAQstarsdata and starsdoc on
    amesarcnasagov
