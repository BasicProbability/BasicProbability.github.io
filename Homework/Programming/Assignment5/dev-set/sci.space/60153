I thought the area rule was pioneered by Boeing
NASA guys developed the rule  but noone knew if it worked
until Boeing built the hardware 727 and maybe the FB111

Nope  The decisive triumph of the area rule was when Convairs YF102 
contractually commmitted to being a Mach 15 fighter and actually found
to be incapable of going supersonic in level flight  was turned into
the arearuled YF102A which met the specs  This was well before either
the 727 or the FB111 the 102 flew in late 1953 and Convair spent most
of the first half of 1954 figuring out what went wrong and most of the
second half building the first 102A

Good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there

I seem to recall somebody built  or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
Passenger civil transport  I thought it was a 727  but maybe it
was a DC 89   Sure it had a funny passenger compartment
but on the other hand  it seemed to save fuel

I thought Area rules  applied even before transonic speeds  just
not as badly
