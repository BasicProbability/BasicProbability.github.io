I think this would be a great way to build it but unfortunately
current spending rules dont permit it to be workable  For this to
work it would be necessary for the government to guarantee a certain
minimum amount of business in order to sufficiently reduce the risk
enough to make this attractive to a private firm  Since they
generally cant allocate money except one year at a time the
government cant provide such a tenant guarantee

	Try reading a bit  THe government does lots of multi year
contracts with Penalty for cancellation clauses  They just like to be
damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
contract   THe reason they arent cutting defense spending as much
as they would like is the Reagan administration signed enough
Multi year contracts  that its now cheaper to just finish them out

Look at SSF  THis years funding is 22 Billion  18 of which will
cover penalty clauses due to the redesign
