Why cant the government just be a tennant Private commercial concerns
could just build a space station system and charge rent to the government
financed researchers wanting to use it

I believe that this was the thought behind the Industrial Space Facility  I
dont remember all the details but I think Space Services  wanted NASA to 
sign an anchor tenancy deal in order to help secure some venture capital but 
NASA didnt like the deal  Im sure Ill hear about it if Im wrong
