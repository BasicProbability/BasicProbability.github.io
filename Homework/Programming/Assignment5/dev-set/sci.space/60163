I always thought GDs  Fighter plants were in Long Island  

No Northrup has a plant on Long Island

I dont think Northrup ever had a plant on Long Island  The two main airframe
manufacturers there were FairchildRepublic which closed its doors after the
T46 cancellation and Grumman which is still hanging on last I time I called
I think Sperry also started there  If youre ever in the area check out the
Cradle of Aviation Museum at Mitchell field now mostly parking lots behind the
Nassau Coliseum and the community college  Good display of vehicles from Long
Island including a LEM flight article
