    A very nice article on the DSS which I thought answered
     David CruzUribes original queries quite well

   Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only
   prepare for a 5 week series I taught in Sunday School but greatly
   increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls 

One other recent book I would heartily recommend is Joseph Fitzmyers
Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls Paulist
1992

Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars  He was also one
of the early workers on the DSS  His book is written in a
straightforward QA that allows it to serve as a source for a great
wealth of clearly presented basic uptothemoment information about
the DSS

This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Browns
Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls
