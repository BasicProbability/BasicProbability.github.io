Subject quality of Catholic liturgy

I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately liturgy in particular Catholic liturgy  In the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass  Its
driving me crazy  The most gracefilled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how to 
do it  Led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to God  But the best Masses Ive been to were participatory prayers

Lately I think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion
of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do
which is necessary because no one knows whats happening next is growing
Example  Last Sunday Palm Sunday we went to the local church  Usually
on Palm Sunday the congregation participates in reading the Passion taking
the role of the mob  The theology behind this seems profoundwhen we say
Crucify him we mean it  We did it and if He came back today wed do it
again  It always gives me chills  But last week we were invited to sit
during the Gospel Passion and listen  Besides the Orwellian invitation 
I was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away  This seems
typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the
musicians readers and so on  New things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows whats happening the new things have to be
explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the Mass were just
sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the Mass is about
to be done  In my mind I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay
experts but that may not be just  I do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothingthats just a fact of
bureaucratic lifeeven though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the Lords presence

So weve been wonderingare we the oddballs or is the quality of the Mass
going down  I dont mean that facetiously  We go to Mass every Thursday or
Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware 
of Gods presence  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Massesmaybe I should 
just offer it up   Has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation in Catholic Masses lately
