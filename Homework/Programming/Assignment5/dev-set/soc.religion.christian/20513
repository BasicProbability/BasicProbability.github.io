Subject Re Ancient Books

In article Apr9011135199316957athosrutgersedu cobbalexialisuiucedu Mike Cobb writes
 But since the manuscripts are so close to the actual event especially as 
 compared with ancient nonChristian history could it help show that we have
 accurate copies of the original texts  

Thats a very weak argumentdue the lack with regard to critical
events of independent supporting texts

As for the dating of the oldest extant texts of the NT  How would
you feel about the US Civil War in a couple of thousand years if the
only extant text was written about now  Now adjust for a largely
illiterate population and one in which every copy of a manuscript is
done by hand
