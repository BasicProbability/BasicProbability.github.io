 My advice is this  If you know someone that you have the hots for who is
 NOT a Christian befriend them and try to develop just a friendship with
 them  At the same time witness and share the gospel with them not so
 that you can date them but so that they can be saved  Once they become a
 Christian then it is quite possible to let the relationship progress
 beyond friendship  However if they dont accept Christ you still have a
 good friendship and you havent wasted a lot of emotional energy and gotten
 hurt

While I agree with most of Jon says I deleted those parts of course I 
have serious reservations about this advice  Maintaining a just 
friends level of relationship is much easier said than done  People 
usually end up getting hurt  This is especially likely to happen when 
they start off with feelings of attraction  

When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement  
Ive had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldnt 
date nonChristians to believing that dating this man would be okay to 
believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each 
other  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to 
their original state  

This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home 
and fellowship  I dont think it would work exactly this way for most 
people  However its important not to underestimate the power of 
feelings of attraction
