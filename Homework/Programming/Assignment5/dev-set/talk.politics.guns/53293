  Rate  per capita rate  The UK is more dangerous
  Though you may be less likely to be killed by a handgun the average
  individual citizen in the UK is twice as likely to be killed
  by whatever means as the average Swiss  Would you feel any better
  about being killed by means other than a handgun I wouldnt
 
 What an absurd argument  Switzerland is onefifth the size of the
 UK with oneeigth as many people therefore at any given point on
 Swiss soil you are more likely to be crow bait  More importantly
 you are 4x as likely to be killed by the next stranger approaching
 you on a Swiss street than in the UK

 You are betraying your lack of understanding about RATE versus TOTAL
 NUMBER Rates are expressed often as 100000 population
 Therefore if a place had 10 deaths and a population of 100000 the
 rate would be 10100000  A place that had 50 deaths and a population
 of 1000000 would hav a rate of 5100000  The former has a higher
 rate the latter a higher total  You are less likely to die in the
 latter  Simple enuff

For chrissakes take out your calculator and work out the numbers
Here Ive preformatted them for you to make it easier

			handgun homicidespopulation
			
	Switzerland 	24   6350000
	         UK     8  55670000

 and then tell me again how Switzerland is safer with a more
liberal handgun law than the UK is withoutby RATE or TOTAL NUMBER
Your choice
