Dear sir

By now we are used to the New England Journal of Medicines publication
of smallscale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are
drawn which are quantum leaps from the data followed by announcements of 
momentus scientific findings These are regularly released to the press
without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs and
often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings
Generally while they at least present a few interesting data however
meaningless the studies misinterpret statistics and ignore or belittle
serious studies by criminologists

The latest effort  Handgun Regulations Crime Assaults and Homicide
A Tale of Two Cities by JH Sloan et al with the accompanying 
editorial Firearms Injuries A Call for Science by two employees
of the Centers for Disease Control November 10 however is an insult
to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few
data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length
to call attention to various major and minor failings in no particular
order

	1 The authors misleadingly cite Wright et al Ref 1 to 
	support the statement that some have argued that restricting
	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate
	of homicide Wright et al in fact studied and rejected that
	contention
	
	2 The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very
	similar cities with similar economic circumstances histories
	demographic characteristics and the like In fact the cities
	are very different with very different demographic characteristics
	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in
	Seattle Both cities are over threeforths nonHispanic white
	and the nonHispanic white homicide rates are reported to be
	the same in Seattle and Vancouver It is the different back
	grounds problems circumstances and behaviors of the various
	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide
	
	3 The authors pretend they are evaluating Canadas gun law
	compared to Washington States But they do not examine at all
	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect
	in 1978 As it happens in the three years prior to that 1975
	1977 Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year oneeighth
	involving handguns Ref 2 and in the seven years of the NEJM
	article there were 29 homicides per year oneeigth involving
	handguns Surely even the medical profession recognizes that
	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding
	that a change made a difference Would a physician conclude that
	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day
	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without
	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen
	
	4 The authors pick two mediumsized cities to evaluate a national
	gun law Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily
	selected sample Seattle appears to have been selected because
	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific
	reason Would physicians call something a scientific study which
	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar control
	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen opposite
	scientific conclusions would follow Vancouvers homicide
	rate exceeds that of such wild west cities in Texas as
	El Paso Corpus Christi Austen and in Colorado Colorado
	Springs Ref 3
	
	5 The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or
	handguns are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in
	Vancouver They use two surrogate approaches in pretending
	to study the availability of firearmshandguns The first is
	an applesandoranges effort to compare the number of carry
	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in
	Vancouver But the number clearly understates the number of
	handguns in Seattle and counts primarily protective handgun
	owners The second however tells nothing about the number
	of handguns in Vancouver and counts nonprotective handguns
	for the most part Where is it difficult to obtain handguns
	legally for protection registration figures are
	meaningless There are 66000 registered handguns in New York
	City New York Daily News Sept 27 1987 Comparing the two
	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100000 population
	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver meaning Vancouver
	has a greater prevalence of weapons than New York City
	
	The second method of measuring gun density is Cooks gun
	prevalence index a previously validated measure of intercity
	differences But the validation was by Cook of his own
	theory Ref 4 Normally second opinions are sought from a
	different doctor More significantly the Cook index is
	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement
	in suicide and homicide So the authors are basically taking
	a measure of misuse Unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide
	42 in Seattle 14 in Vancouver is related to gun misuse in
	homicide plus suicide divided by two 41 in Seattle 12 in
	Vancouver The authors are not measuring the relative avail
	ability of firearms or of handguns in Seattle and
	Vancouver
	
	6 The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and
	Canada They neglect to mention the significant fact that
	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to
	the purchase of a handgun and that provisions exist in Canadian
	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal
	protection The authors also make it appear that it is more
	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually
	the case
	
	7 The authors ignore all other factors which might explain
	the differences in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the
	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 
	clearence for one particular offense  homicide involving a
	firearm There is no measure of the differences in the number
	of law enforcement officers their aggressiveness in making
	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions arrest
	rates for other offenses conviction rates actual sentences
	imposed for gunrelated crimes violent crimes without guns
	or gun law violations or incarceration rates Whereas social
	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences
	the authors of the NEJM tale of two cities fail even to mention
	most factors related to crime control
	
	8 The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective
	means for protection unless the criminal is killed Such is not
	the case Criminologists Ref 58 have found that almost
	650000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from
	criminals and that using a gun for protection reduces the
	liklihood that a crime  rape robbery assault  will be
	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury
	to the victim It is interesting nonetheless that the authors
	reported the same number four of civilian justifiable homicides
	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle
	accounted for 100 of the reported civilian justifiable homicides
	involving firearms
	
	9 The Centers for Disease Control which funded the study
	editorially praised the paper Ref 9 saying it applied
	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb
	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms particularly
	handguns There is nothing in the paper which could possibly
	be mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists or
	criminologists The VancouverSeattle study is the equivolent
	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding
	two ordinarylooking middleclass white males one aged 25
	and the other 40 and without first taking their vital signs
	administering the experimental drug to the 25yearold while
	giving the 40yearold a placebo then taking their blood pressure
	and on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure 
	announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough
	It would be nice to think that such a study would neither be
	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM
	
	Since the longstanding antigun biases of the NEJM and the CDC
	make them willing to present shoddy research as scientific
	breakthroughs in special articles and editorials relating
	to firearms we are obligated to correct the record by notifying
	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight
	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about
	the distortions contained in Handgun Regulations Crime Assaults
	and Homicides A Tale of Two Cities and Firearm Injuries A Call
	for Science Clearly all scientific standards go by the wayside
	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize
	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America

                             GUNS AND SPUTTER
                            by James D Wright
          from July 1989 issue of REASON Free Minds  Free Markets

      Someone once wrote Statistics are like a bikini  What they real is
   suggestive but what they conceal is vital  The problem is demonstrated
   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting
   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide  Funded by
   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal
   of Medicine the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and
   suggested that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a 
   community
      The nine medical doctors who published Handgun Regulations Crime
   Assaults and Homicide essentially reasoned in three steps 1 Despite
   many historical social and demographic similarities 2 Vancouver
   has a markedly lower homicide rate 3 because its stricter gun regulations
   make guns less available  The second step in their reasoning seems
   indisputable  The overall homicide rate in Seattle for the period
   198086 was 113 per 100000 popuation compared with 69 in Vancouver
   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle  The question then becomes
   Why
      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case
   to support the notion as claimed in the third step of their reasoning
   that Vancouvers handgun regulations are much more stringent  But their
   evidence on the difference in gun availabilty is indirect and 
   unpersuasive indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point
   does not exist  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support
   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle but for all anybody
   knows as a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true  We
   are therefore being asked at the conclusion of the study to believe that
   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates
   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established
      Indeed the situation is even more troublesome  The first of the two
   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed
   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restrictedweapons
   permits issued in Vancouver  Differences between the two cities in the
   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable
     The second bit of evidence is Cooks gun prevalence index which stands
  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver  Cooks index
  however does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in 
  various cities  It measures gun misuseit is an average of the percentage
  of homicides and suicides involving firearms
     In the present case the index shows only that in homicides and suicides
  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver  To take
  Cooks index as a measure of general firearms availability it must be
  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides
  is directly related to their relative availability in the general 
  population  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove To
  assume what one is seeking to prove then to prove it on the basis of
  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything
      Even if we were to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that
   guns are less common in Vancouver we might still question what causes what
   The authors attribute Seattles higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun
   ownership  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates
   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain gunsin other words
   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa
      In fact it was once commonly argued that Great Britains low rate of
   violent crime was a function of that nations strict gun laws and the 
   consequent low rate of gun ownershipuntil British researcher Colin 
   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime
   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted  To invoke
   an ancient methodological saw correlation is not cause
      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data
   on gun ownership  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are similar in
   many ways implying that they differ mainly in gun availability gunlaw
   stringency and crime rates  This is an evident attempt to establish
   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysisthat all
   else is equal among things being compared
     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways but a closer look 
  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime
  or homicide rates  The cities are closely matched in what percentage
  of their population is white 79 percent and 76 percent  But Seattle
  is about 10 percent black while Vancouver is less than 05 percent
  Vancouvers minority population is overwhelmingly Asian  So although the
  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half
  dozen readily available demographic indicators they have not shown
  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out
     In fact the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is
  particularly relevant in light of the studys breakdown of homicide rates
  according to the race of the victim  For the white majority the homicide
  rates are nearly identical62 per 100000 in Seattle 64 in Vancouver
  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due
  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities  For blacks
  the observed difference in homicide rate is 366 to 95 and for Hispanics
  269 to 79  Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison
  problematic but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver  Racial
  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle
  than in Vancouver the white majority is equally likely to be slain
  in either city
      Since the nearly 21 initial difference in homicide reates between the
   cities is due exclusively to 31 or 41 differences between minority 
   groups it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability
   or gunlaw strigency would matter so dramatically to minorities but not
   matter at all to whites  Can differential gun availability explain why
   blacks and Hispanicsbut not whitesare so much more likely to be killed
   in Seattle than in Vancouver  Studies in the United States incidentally
   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership
      Or are other explanations more plausible  Could the disparity between
   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have 
   anything to do with it  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol 
   abuse  Of homelessness among each ctys minority population  The city
   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the 
   Mississippi  Unemployment among young centralcity nonwhite men in the
   United States usually exceeds 40 percent  What is the comparable Canadian
   percentage
      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many
   ways as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries  Absent
   more detailed analysis nearly any of these many ways might explain part
   or all of the difference in homicide rates  In gross comparisons such
   as those between Seattle and Vancouver all else is not equal
     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide
  result in a complex picture  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing
  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument  They
  also acknowledge that socioeconomic status is probably an important
  confounding factor in our comparison remarking further that blacks   
  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of
  Vancouvers population  Given the evidence presented in the article
  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle
  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattles racial
  minorities  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility
  since detailed information about household incomes according to race
  is not available for Vancouver
      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in 
   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple
   example  If one were to take all US couties and compare them in terms
   of 1 pervalence of gun ownership and 2 crime or homicide rates one 
   would find an astonishing pattern Counties with more guns have less crime
   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce 
   crime  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into
   account  In this example the hidden variable is city size Guns are
   more common in small towns and rural areas whereas crime is a bigcity
   problem  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable or lacked the
   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences they coud be very
   seriously misled  In the study at hand the authors matched two cities
   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables
   and their results are impossible to interpret
      In the editorial Firearm Injuries A Call for Science accompanying
   the study two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the
   authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public
   heath significance  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from
   nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method is to anticipate
   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them
   out  Absent such effort the results may well seem scientific but are
   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research  That this
   study is but one of a number of recent effortsall employing practical
   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals
   is cause for further concern

   researched extensively on the relationship of firearms and crime
