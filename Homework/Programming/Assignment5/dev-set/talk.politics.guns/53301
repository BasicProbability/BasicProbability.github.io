Both the  Gun Nuts and the gays are aggressively defensive and quite
hostile to any one trying to deprive them of their rights  Just like
any group trying to protect their rights

The fallacy of this whole thing is that YOUR RIGHTS ARE NOT IN JEAPARDY
BY THESE POSTS  

How can you say that  I presume that you mean that talking about
restricting rights is not the same as restricting those rights  Well
arguing for those restrictions may lead to implementation much
the same way as assault can lead to battery legal definitions

Most tpg people and the homosexual groups wont even
discuss the subject at all in a polite form  The mere raising of a question
as to why the rights are there or what exactly the right encompasses
bring shrill posts and angryhostile traffic  

Well I cant speak for the homosexuals but Ive seen ALOT
of polite discussion on tpg  Please everyone dont take
this guys word or mine for that matter on it  Read tpg
for a while and try to determine from which direction most of
the flameage originates  If you post without flamebait you
will generally receive reasoned responses  True there are
those who tend to lose their tempers quickly as there are on
all newsgroups but they really do feel their rights are in jeopardy

Oh and neat trick talking derisively about another newsgroup while
not crossposting to allow them to defend themselves

I think a lot of tpg people have very thin skin when it comes to 
discussing these subjects

Methinks you doth protest too much
