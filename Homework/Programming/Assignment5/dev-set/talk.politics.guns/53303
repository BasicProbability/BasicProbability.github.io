Subject Re IMPORTANT HOLLY SILVA INFORMATION

In article 1pkojmINNmuqcaecadgatechedu vincentcadgatechedu Vincent Fox writes
 In a separate post over on soccultureusa she explicitly said that while
 she crossposts to tpg and sets followups to there she does not READ
 talkpoliticsguns If you think about it its a clever way of keeping
 some of the politer respondents who will edit their newsgoup line or
 properly use the followup from being heard over there It also makes it
 easier for her to claim all she ever sees is squeaky weasels

 So if you want her to see your insiteful analysis email it If you
 want to point out her flaws in public make sure your newsgroup line
 includes soccultureusa

To keep from flooding scu I emailed it  However I agree that its
quite the sneaky trick  No more than I would expect however
