Subject Re ATF suspects drug lab in compound

In article 1993Mar2818062921574mnemosynecsduedu rcandersnyxcsduedu Mr Nice Guy writes
A Associated Press News story 32893 reports
 
    In other developments Saturday David Troy intelligence chief for
the ATF confirmed reports that authorities suspected the cult had a
methamphetamine lab  He said evidence of possible drug activity
surfaced late in the ATF investigation of the cults gun dealings

Wow the scope of the mission of the ATF continues to expand  Besides
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms they now seem to be involded in Child
Protective Services Drug Enforcement and Tax Evasion

They look to be on the road to being the nations boys in blue
No Knock in one hand M16 in the other  ZeikHeil
