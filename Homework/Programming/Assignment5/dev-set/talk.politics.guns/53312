 No you havent read it very closely   It says you may answer No if your
 civil rights have been restored that can be done either by the feds or a
 a state  I think the feds stopped doing this for those convicted of violent
 felonies  At least a dozen states still restore a felons civil rights some
 immediately upon release some after a waiting period  I will post a list
 of the states later
 

  A quick question then Larry If a persons civil rights have been restored 
  then are they still considered a felon

Good question I dont know what the law considers them

  IMO if rights have been restored then it makes sense to me that the
  record of the felony and everything else has been purged and the
  person in question is no longer a felon

I believe this is what happens in some states
