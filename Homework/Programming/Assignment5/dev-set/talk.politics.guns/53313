  Well as Neal Knox of the Firearms Coalition points out the full
  force of the antigun ruling class their multimillions their
  polling organizations their schools their news media their
  entertainment media
 
 The entertainment media a force of the antigun ruling class
 Is this the same media thats made billions producing films and
 television that glorify guns and gun users  Or is that another
 antigun media
 
 Youve got to be kidding

By this do you mean that you consider it absolutely impossible for the
media to be guilty of hypocrisy

Note that the film industry in California traded their political support
for an assault weapon ban in the state for an amendment to the bill
exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban

Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book Seduction of the Gun
that was produced as a tool for guncontrol organizations carries a back
page ad for a Terminator II video game extolling the numerous and
varied sophisticated weapons available to the player

Note that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger publisher of the NY Times  one of the
oldest and most incessant guncontrol grinders  himself carries a
concealed handgun

Still you find it completely incredible that these folks live by the 
aphorism Do as I say and not as I do
