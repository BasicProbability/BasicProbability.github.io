 ObGuns  Im moving to Arizona everyone carries guns there  If I dont what
 are the approximate probabilities that Ill get shot by the end of six months
 
 Under 1 in 20000 assuming FBI statistics are meaningfull

Of course if youre a criminal or hang around with criminals or
flash large wads of cash in the wilder parts of town or utter verbal
bigotry in the right public places your chances of being shot are much
higher

Avoiding these behaviors on the other hand decreases your chances of
being shot

Something like 60 of all murders are criminals killing criminals 
Over 90 of murders are committed by people with a prior known
history of violence

Simplistic moral suitable for my three year old and most inane
posters  Bad people do bad things  repeatedly
