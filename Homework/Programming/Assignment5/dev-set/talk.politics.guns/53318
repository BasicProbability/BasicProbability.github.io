Subject Re Gun Control was Re Were Mad as Hell at the TV News

In article C4tr3MEqwmagpielinknetcom manesmagpielinknetcom Steve Manes writes
On the other hand we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more
culturally similar namely the Canadians

I dont think such a Canada is any more culturally similar to
the United States than England In terms of laws regarding individual
rights restrictions on police searches etc all closely
related to crime Canadian laws parallel Englands and differ
greatly from those of the United States
  
In fact an exhaustive
sevenyear study has already been done of the respective crime rates
of Vancouver British Columbia and Seattle Washington cities
with roughly the same population urban economy geography
and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control

Actually they do not have roughly the same urban economy 
and extremely different ethnic composition

Over the sevenyear study 388 homicides occurred in Seattle
113 per 100000 vs 204 homicides in Vancouver 69 per 100000
After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations
the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle as
compared to Vancouver was found to be 163

However if you account for economic and ethnic differences
the difference disappears completely Seattles minorities are
predominatly poor while Vancouvers are middle or upper class
The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle
while the rate for poor Seattle minorities was almost three
times as great as for the welltodo minorities of Vancouver
The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations not
one of gun control

The authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable
homicides selfdefense  Only 32 such homicides occurred during
the sevenyear study 11 of which were committed by police  Only
21 cases of civilians acting in selfdefense occurrred

That is a gross distortion Selfdefense does not mean killing
the attacker There were 21 cases of civilians killing their 
attacker in selfdefence But such cases represent less that
05 of the crimes prevented by armed selfdefence for every
case you cite there were over 200 other cases of selfdefence
where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed
05 by the way is the most conservative possible figure
based on the National Crime Surveys estimate of 80000
crimes prevented by armed selfdefence each year Most other 
studies on the subject put the figure at 500000 to 600000
Those figures would imply less than 008 of sucessful selfdefences
involve killing the attacker 

So more correctly there over 4000 possibly as many as 25000 
cases of civilians acting in selfdefence only 21 of which resulted
in the death of the attacker This is a significant factor in
comparison to the 592 homicides If memory serves homicides
make up approximately 1 of the violent crimes the study
considered so the fair comparison would be 40  250 homicides
prevented and 592 homicides Clearly the study can not be
close to accurate since it ignored these cases of selfdefence
