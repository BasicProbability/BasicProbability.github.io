 This argument sounds very stupid if the ability to make guns from
 simple metalworking was easy  then Drug dealers would make their own 
 wouldnt they why spend hundreds of dollars buying a gun that
 somebody else made cheap and is selling it to you at an
 exorbitant markup The simple truth of the matter is that regardless
 of how easy it is to make guns banning guns will reduce the 
 the number of new guns and seriuosly impede the efforts of a 
 killer intent on buying a weapon
 To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen take an
 analogy from computer science almost every computer science major
 can write a wordprocessor yet wecomp sci majors  would willingly pay 3  
 to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect why dont we  
 just all write our own software Because it is highly  
 inconvinient
 Same with guns secondly how does one get this gunpowder for the 
 home made gun  Take a quick trip to the local 7eleven
  If guns were really that simple to make the Bosnian muslims would
 be very happy people or is it the case that metalworking tools are
 banned in bosnia deep sarcasm  
 
 well this is my two cents
    i will now resume reading all these ridiculus post from people
      who must make their living doing standup comedy

And so the rubber spheroid arced beneath the brilliant lights
Headed for a hoop of dreams hed dreamt of all those nights
The crowd gasped as the ball descended Would it grant their fondest wish
There was no doubt in Caseys mind He knew it was a SWISH
