The NRA supports anyone whos progun and has a chance of winning
election regardless of their other positions  Is it their fault that
some druglegalizers are antigun  Is it their fault that the
druglegalizers who are progun cant get elected

     Its not the NRAs fault but it is something to consider if you are
considering contributing to the NRA If candidate B is a complete asshole
whose only saving grace is that he opposes unnecessary restrictions on
firearms I wouldnt want my membership dues funding efforts to get him
reelected

     I have other problems with the NRA as an organization the individual
members Ive met have been loyal trustworthy honest brave etc
especially my boss who probably reads this newsgroup B they are
definitely prohunting and I recall seeing a proDesert Storm NRA bumper
sticker Sometimes they come on too strong in the political arena which
contributes to their reputation as bad guys amoung many people

 sweetness and respecting her seniority  EB White
