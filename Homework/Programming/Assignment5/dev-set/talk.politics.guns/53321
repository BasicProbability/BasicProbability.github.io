I just heard some antiguncontrol people giving the usual arguments
Its everyones right to bear arms and the way to solve the problem
of people getting killed by guns is better law enforcement

It strikes me that this argument could be logically extended as follows

A nuclear weapon is an arm hence anyone has a right to have 
nuclear weapons And if someone uses his nuclear weapons to blow
up New York LA and Chicago thats okay as long as we have a
good police force capable of finding him and putting him in jail 
which will serve as a deterrent to others

Do any antiguncontrol people disagree with this and if so  why

Yes I am progun and yes I do disagree with this statement
Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous  Radioactive
decay of plutonium and uranium as well as the tritium in the
weapon tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things
Can you say neutron flux  Plus these things have no self
defense purposes  Its kinda hard to justify their use as
a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
lowyield weapons or at worst for industrial target obliteration
translation  cities and population centers  Not to mention that
for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live
requires some sort of launch vehicle
