 You are betraying your lack of understanding about RATE versus TOTAL
 NUMBER Rates are expressed often as 100000 population
 Therefore if a place had 10 deaths and a population of 100000 the
 rate would be 10100000  A place that had 50 deaths and a population
 of 1000000 would hav a rate of 5100000  The former has a higher
 rate the latter a higher total  You are less likely to die in the
 latter  Simple enuff

For chrissakes take out your calculator and work out the numbers
Here Ive preformatted them for you to make it easier

			handgun homicidespopulation
			
	Switzerland 	24   6350000
	         UK     8  55670000

 and then tell me again how Switzerland is safer with a more
liberal handgun law than the UK is withoutby RATE or TOTAL NUMBER
Your choice

Because there are about 40 homicides total ie using guns knives
tireirons baseball bats bare hands etc in Switzerland
each year and 850 homicides total in England Thats three
times worse per capita in England than in Switzerland Since
dead is dead it really doesnt matter that 60 of the Switz
murders involved a gun or that only 09 of the English murderers
do
