 Hassan and some other seemed not to be a ware that Jews celebrating on
 these days Thje Passover holliday the holidy of going a way from the
 Nile
 So if one let his imagination freely work it seemed beter to write
 that the Zionist drean is from the misisipi to the Nile 

the question is by going East or West from the misisipi on either choice
you would loose Palestine or Broklyn NY

I thought youre gonna say fromn misisipi back to the misisipi 

 By the way 
 
 What are the borders the Islamic world dreams about 
 
 Islamic readers I am waiting to your honest answer

Lets say   lets establish the islamic state first or lets free our
occupied lands first And then we can dream about expansion Mr Gideon
