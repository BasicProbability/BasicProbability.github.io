How many Mutlus can dance on the head of a pin

That reminds me of the Armenian massacre of the Turks

Joel I took out SCT are we sure we want to invoke the name of he who
greps for Mason Kibos last name lest he include AFU in his daily
rounds

I dunno Warren  Just the other day I heard a rumor that Serdar Argic
aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT is not really a Turk at all
but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the
massacres in Armenia of Turks so noiseladen as to make serious discussion
impossible thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud
of confusion  


DIs it possible to track down zuma and determine whowhatwhere seradr is
If not why not I assume hisherits identity is not shielded by policies
similar to those in place at anonymous services
