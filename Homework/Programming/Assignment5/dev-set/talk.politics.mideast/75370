 Pardon me Here is to an amherstclown
 
 Your three chiefs Dro Hamazasp and Kulkhandanian are the ringleaders
  of the bands which have destroyed Tartar villages and have staged 
  massacres in Zangezour Surmali Etchmiadzin and Zangibasar This is
  intolerable

This is about Armenia

Were you expecting a different response Here is another one

p 25 third paragraph

Some real fighters sprang up from among the people who struck terror
 into the hearts of the Turks


Within a few months after the war began these Armenian guerrilla
 forces operating in close coordination with the Russians were
 savagely attacking Turkish cities towns and villages in the east
 massacring their inhabitants without mercy while at the same time
 working to sabotage the Ottoman armys war effort by destroying roads
 and bridges raiding caravans and doing whatever else they could to
 ease Russian occupation The atrocities committed by the Armenian 
 volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the 
 Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the 
 fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties The memoirs of many
 Russian officers who served in the east at this time are filled with 
 accounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenian 
 guerrillas which were savage even by relatively primitive standards of
 war then observed in such areas1

 honored me by reproducing my text  Unfortunately he has still not produced
 the documents on Jews in LATVIA  Instead he asks for my views on the
 Turkish Genocide  Well that debate seems to be going on in a few hundred
 other threads  Ill let other people bring the usual charges try to debunk
 MutluArgicCosar a netwide Terrorism Triangle and their spurious evidence
 
 When that does ever happen look out the window to see if there is a
 nonfascist xSoviet Armenian Government in the East Now where is
 your nonexistent list of scholars What a moronian During the First 
 World War and the ensuing years  19141920 the Armenian Dictatorship 
 through a premeditated and systematic genocide tried to complete its 
 centuriesold policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by 
 savagely murdering 25 million Muslims and deporting the rest from 
 their 1000 year homeland

This paragraph is wellwritten and interesting Serdar baby but it has nothing
to do with Jews in LATVIA  I have not presented a list of scholars  

How could you Because there is none

I am not
interested in an exSoviet why do you write x  Its very cute Armenian
Government nonfascist or otherwise  You are not responding to what I am
writing  Instead you are autoposting your own particular brand of bullshit

Like conversing with a brick wall And you are not responding to what I 
am writing By the way that bullshit is justly regarded as the first 
instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people
For nearly one thousand years the Turkish and Kurdish people lived 
on their homeland  the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet 
and Armenian occupation The persecutions culminated in 1914 The 
Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its 
Muslim subjects 25 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland After one thousand years 
Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye

Today xSoviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by xSoviet Armenia

Today xSoviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity

xSoviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds

You have now done so four times in a row  May I legitimately conclude that
you are not indeed a regular netuser but an autoposting computer program
which for convenience I have called MUTLUEXE

You may assert whatever you wish

Here we go with MUTLUEXEs famed list of sources

Ditto

 The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
 of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people
 This event is incontrovertibly proven by historians government
 and international political leaders such as US Ambassador Mark 
 Bristol 

and on and on for 46 lines

And still anxiously awaiting

 so the list goes on and on and on
 
 Im still trying to find out about those Jews in LATVIA  Can you post those 
 documents PLEEEEEEEASE Mr Argic  Puhleeze could you  Cmon its my
 birthday in three weeks post them for me as a birthday present
 
 Remember the issue at hand is the coldblooded genocide of 25 million 
 Muslim people by the Armenians between 19141920 and the ArmenianNazi 
 collaboration during World War II Anything to add

No darling READ what I post  Other people are asking you about the Turkish
genocide  I am asking you to produce the documents on Jews in Latvia  No
matter how many times you erase what I post I will still post the same
question  Post the documents on Jews in Latvia  Do not autopost the same
block of text about the Turkish genocide  

Remember the issue at hand is the ArmenianNazi collaboration during 
World War II and the Turkish Genocide And I still fail to see how
you can challenge the following western sources

Source John Dewey The New Republic Vol 40 Nov 12 1928 pp 2689

Happy the minority Jews which has had no Christian nation to protect it
 And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in fanatic Turkey
 when they were expelled from Europe especially Spain by Saintly Christians
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers To one brought up as most Americans have 
 been in the Gladstonian and foreignmissionary tradition the condition of 
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every 
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable One readily 
 reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate 

He also stated that

they Armenians traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian 
 invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war and that they burned at least
 a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population

 I want the documents of Jews in Latvia  I think several other
 people on socculturegreek are already disputing with you about the Turkish
 Genocide
 
 Is this the joke of the month Who when how where What a clown

No sweetie the joke of the month is that you have now posted the same
block of text four times but you still have not produced the documents on
Jews in Latvia  Instead you post the same text you post in every other
message that same old McCarthy table how appropriate its named McCarthy

How about Prof Shaw a Jewish scholar

In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van whose 33789 Armenians comprised 423 percent of the population 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the EmpireLeaving Erivan 
 on April 28 1915 Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake

Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state the Ottoman Empire and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories Armenian political leaders army officers and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves

With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottomans enemy
 increased drastically Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies

Meanwhile Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final
 plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans with the 
 president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response

 From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
  glorious Russian Army with their blood to serve the victory of Russian
  armsLet the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the
  Bosporus Let with Your will great Majesty the peoples remaining
  under the Turkish yoke receive freedom Let the Armenian people of Turkey
  who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new
  free life under the protection of Russia155

Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies Preparations were made
to strike the Ottomans from the rear and the czar returned to St Petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach Istanbul

An Armenian state was organized at Van under Russian protection and it 
 appeared that with the Muslim natives dead or driven away it might be
 able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient Armenian
 civilization An Armenian legion was organized to expel the Turks from
 the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
 Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet162 Thousands of Armenians from
 Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
 Armenian stateBy midJuly there were as many as 250000 Armenians
 crowded into the Van area which before the crisis had housed and fed
 no more than 50000 people Muslim and nonMuslim alike163

Why

 Who gives a thunder about your pseudoscholar jokes Iam arguing about 
 the ArmenianNazi colaboration during World War II Any comment

Argue it with someone else or do not reply to my posts Argic my love  I 
am not arguing about the ArmenianNazi collaboration  I do not give a 
thunder about it  I want you to do one of three things
a admit that you are not a regular user but a computer autoposting Turkish
propaganda or
b post the documents on Jews in Latvia or
c run away like the coward without a real address that you are and do not
reply to my posts

It could be perhaps your head wasnt screwed on just right In 1941 
while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration 
camps the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the Nazis In 1943 this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of 20000strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader Dro the butcher who was the former dictator of the
shortlived Armenian Dictatorship 19181920 and the architect of the 
coldblooded genocide of 25 million Turks and Kurds between 19141920
An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party 
leaders in Berlin which was recognized by the Nazis Encouraged by 
this the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitlers policy of 
extermination of the Jews

This ArmenianNazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an encore
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI when they backstabbed and
exterminated 25 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army

Furthermore as McCarthy put it the Armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros
Armistice with the Allies October 30 1918 The Allies had decided
to create a Greater Armenia including the old Russian province
of Yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of Anatolia
claimed by the Armenian fanatics Only the area called Cilicia
around the Ottoman province of Adana was to be excluded as it
had already been claimed by the French The Allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks who
could be expected to oppose their plans 

On April 19 1919 the British Army occupied Kars gave civilian
and military power over to the Armenians then withdrew The British
planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship even 
though the Russian prewar census had shown Kars Province to be over
60 Muslim The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed but the 
British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains The fate of
the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in Eastern Anatolia Murder pillage genocide and the destruction
of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of
Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the Ottoman Army The British had left 
the scene to the Armenian genocide squads Therefore few 
Europeans were present to observe the genocide One British
soldier Colonel Rawlinson who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of Otoman soldiers saw what was occurring 

Rawlinson wired to his superiors 

in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the Moslim population as their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control
 atrocities were constantly being committed 

Instead you post more Armenian nonsense

Come again

 These European Dashnags with headquarters in Berlin appealed to

Armenian gangs have been murdering and inflicting cruelties on
 innocent people of the region This verified information supported
 by clear statements of reliable eyewitnesses was also confirmed by
 General Odishelidje Commander of the Russian Caucasian Army

 Armenians are entering every place evacuated by Russians carrying out
 murders cruelties rape and all kind of atrocities which cannot be
 expressed in writing murdering all the women children aged people
 who happen to be in the street These barbarous murders repeated 
 every day with new methods continue and the Russian Army has been urged
 to intervene to terminate these atrocities Public opinion is appalled
 and horrified Newspapers are describing the happenings as shocking
 We have decided to inform all our friends urgently about the situation

The situation in the cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have 
 recently taken over is given below

 These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered have been destroyed
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the twoyear Russian occupation

 All barracks buildings of Erzincan the cavalry barracks in Erzurum
 the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those
 burnt In short both cities are burnt destroyed and trees cut down

 As to the people of these cities

 All people old enough to use weapons rounded up taken to the Sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered The remaining people
 were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the 
 withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells burnt in houses mutilated by bayonets their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses their lungs and livers torn out girls
 and women hung up by their hair after all kinds of devilish acts
 The few people who were able to survive these cruelties worse than
 those of the Spanish Inquisition are in poverty more dead than alive
 horrified some driven insane about 1500 in Erzincan and 30000 in
 Erzurum The people are hungry and in poverty for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them their lands left uncultivated

 The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the Russians The villages round Erzincan and 
 Erzurum are in the worst condition Some villages on the road have 
 been leveled to the ground leaving no stone the people completely
 massacred

 Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions

  a long list
  a long list
