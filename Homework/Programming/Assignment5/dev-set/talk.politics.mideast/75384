        I get the impression Hasan realized he goofed and is now
        trying to drop the thread Let him It might save some
        miniscule portion of his sorry face

       Not really since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself
       from any name calling i started trashing any article that contains
       such abuses without responding to and sometimes not even reading articles 
       written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company
    
    Ah but in my followup on the subject which you by the way never bothered
    responding to there was no namecalling Hence the assumption
    Do you feel more up to it now so that we might have an answer
    Or to refresh your memory does the human right issue in the area
    apply to Palestinians only Also do you claim there is such a thing as 
    forfeiting a human right If thats possible then explain to the rest of 
    us how there can exist any such thing
    
    Use your logic and convince us This is your golden chance

   well  ok lets see what Master of Wisdom Mr Jonas Flygare
   wrote that can be wisdomely responded to

um well debate again

         In case you didNOT know Palestineans were there for 18 months 
         and they are coming back
         when you agree to give Palestineans their HUMANRIGHTS

         Afterall human rights areNOT negotiable

      Correct me if Im wrong but isnt the right to ones life also
      a human right Or does it only apply to palestinians

     No it is EVERYBODYs right However when a killer kills then he is giving
     up willingly or unwillingly  his lifes right to the society 
     the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by 
     depriving the killer off his lifes right

    So then its all right for Israel to kill the people who kill Israelis
    The old eye for an eye thinking Funny I thought modern legal systems
    were made to counter exactly that

   So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you Master of Wsidom 
							       

If you insist on giving me namestitles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly sigh

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE 
   and hence ALL their actions their courts their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories

No I am not neglecting that Im merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live a as you so eloquently put it human right We can get back to the 
question of which law should be used in the territories later Also you have 
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights

   What do you expect me to tell you Master of Wisdom when I did explain my
   point in the post that you responded to The point is that since Israel 
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
   to the Occupied Palestineans which is exactly similar the automatic 
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society

If a state can deprive all its citizens of human rights by its actions then 
tell me why any human living today should have any rights at all

     In conjugtion with the above when a group of people occupies others 
     territories and rule them by force then this group would be willingly or 
     unwillingly deprived from some of its rights 

    Such as the right to live Thats nice The swedish government is a group
    of people that rule me by force Does that give me the right to kill
    them

   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here 

Worthy or not I was just applying your logic to a related problem
Am I to assume you admit it wouldnt hold

     What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue
     The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law
     US law Israeli law 

    And now its very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a 
    point Excuse me while I throw up

   ok Master of Wisdom is throwing up 
   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it 

Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone
Ill let you in on a secret Its not for real Take my word for it

     It seems that the US law represented by US State dept in this case
     is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories
     Anyway as for Hamas then obviously they turned to the islamic system

    And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem Why  because
   any system can solve it 
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here all palestine 

I asked for which system should be used that will preserve human rights for 
all people involved I assumed that was obvious but I wont repeat that 
mistake Now that I have straightened that out Im eagerly awaiting your 
reply

   Joseph Weitz administrator responsible for Jewish colonization 
   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940
	   Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
	   peoples together in this country We shall not achieve our goal
						                  
	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country
	   The only solution is a Palestine at least Western Palestine west of
	   the Jordan river without Arabs And there is no other way than
	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries to
	   transfer all of them not one village not one tribe should be 
	   left Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren There is no other way out

Just a question If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter thats the english translations if you have other information Id
be interested to have you translate it why should we give any credence to 
a private paper even older Im not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above but its fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics Guess what Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region Ever Its those who are willing to 
make a tabula rasa and start over and willing to give in order to get 
something back


   We and our either refers to Zionists or Jews i donot know which 

   Well i can give you an answer you Master of Wisdom I will NOT suggest the 
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem 

   I think that is fair enough 

No that is not an answer since I asked for a system that could solve 
the problem You said any could be used then you provided a contradiction
Guess where that takes your logic To nevernever land

Oh and by the way let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
a real bummer when I try giving your posts any credit
