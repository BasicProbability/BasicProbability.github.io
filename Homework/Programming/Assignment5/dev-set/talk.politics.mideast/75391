 What are you talking about  The Rabin government has clearly
 indicated its interest in a territorial compromise that would leave
 the vast majority of the Arabs in Judea Samaria and Gaza outside
 Israeli control

just an interrupting comment here Since EARLY 1980s  israelis said they are 
willing to give up the Adminstration rule of the occupied terretories to
Palestineans Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies
them their right of SELFDETERMINATION period

 I know I was just pointing out that not compromising may be a bad idea And
 there are in Israel voices against negotiations And I think there are many
 among palestineans also against any negociations 
 
 Just an opinion

Ok I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations However
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it

As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the socalled peace process they
are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank and most probably the same
for Golan Heights back to the Arabs An 18 months of negotiations in Madrid
and Washington proved these predictions Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to
loose 

Arabs feel that the current negotiations is ONLY for legitimizing the current
statusquo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
oranges That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked 

Just an opinion
