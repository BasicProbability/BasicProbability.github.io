Subject Re No land for peace  No negotiatians

Ok I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations However
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it

Sounds like wishful guessing


As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the socalled peace process they
are not against peace per se but rather for their wellfounded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank and most probably the same
for Golan Heights back to the Arabs An 18 months of negotiations in Madrid
and Washington proved these predictions Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for noresult negotiations
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations what do they have to
loose 


Socalled  What do you mean  How would you see the peace process

So you say palestineans do not negociate because of wellfounded predictions 
How do you know that they are well founded if you do not test them at the 
table  18 months did not prove anything but its always the other side at 
fault right 

Why  I do not know why but if lets say the Palestineans some of them want
ALL ISRAEL and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis

Or maybe they palestinenans are not yet ready for statehood 

Or maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership too many
fractions aso 

I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one but any of
these could make arabs stall the negotiations

Arabs feel that the current negotiations is ONLY for legitimizing the current
statusquo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
oranges That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked
 
I like California oranges And the feelings may get sharper at the table
