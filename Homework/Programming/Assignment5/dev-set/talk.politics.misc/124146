 I cant find my source
 But  If you state that you will retract your claim Ill go dig one up
 at the library  Fair enough
 
 	ARE YOU SERIOUS  Im not talking about retracting anything until
 you have produced SOMETHING
 
 	If you were not just talking off the top of your head I would
 assume that you have SOME memory of what your source is
 
 	PUT UP NOW without conditions


Yes very serious  I claim that I can substantiate my statement that
Rudman says he doesnt believe Perot was investigating him  You claim
Perot was investigating him  If you will state that you were in error
on this point provided I produce the source Ill go dig it up

Now give me one reason why I should go to the trouble if you wont
agree to this  It is simple enough you know  But I dont have time
to waste if youll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually
post
