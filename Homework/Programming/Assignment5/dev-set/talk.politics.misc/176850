Homosexuals have been lying about the 10 number for so long that
the politicians are running scared of them  Of course homosexuals
lying should be no surprise


How can you lie about something that no one knows for sure  I am the first
to state that the 10 figure may be too high but it may just be too low
depending on what you are talking about

Keep in mind that there are practicing heterosexuals that are actually
gay  These people chose to take a road that avoids being harassed and
they wanted to fitin with everyone other normal person

But lets get off of this irrational behavior of calling everyone a liar
you cannot even start to support such claims

Also the corrupt criminal and lying nature of Kinseys work which
provides much of the justification for homosexual rights in the modern
era should make people step back for a moment and question the rest
of the crap that they have been forcefed by the news media

This sure sounds definitive  How do you label Kinseys work like this
from that factually based and scientific journal WSJ

 
Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all

This is an interesting statement  Do you realize how many things you do

required on occasion that all parties may not be mutually consenting
