 If homosexuals did keep themselves in the privacy of their own home this 
 wouldnt be a problem  However there are various cliques sp that
 dont  They want to present the argument that it is just as moral and
 right as heterosexuality
 
 You know Im offended by newspapers publicly announcing weddings
 Heterosexuals should keep their nutpials out of the public eyes They
 should be banned from wearing wedding rings From having legal recognition
 of marriage
 
 Anything thats public and sexual dont mix

The difference of course is that we are right and you are wrong
If you are a minority that wants freedom it helps to not be 
obnoxious about it  It does not surprise me that as groups like

TRANSLATION you minorities stay in predesignated areas  We the majority
are right anything you do is wrong since might makes right and
the majority always rules

Queer Nation become increasingly belligerent in their public 
demonstrations that violence against homosexuals rises  Anything
that reminds the crazies who like to beat up homosexuals of their
presence is going to aggravate things


Oh crime prevention at its best  Well lets extrapolate this maybe if 
you didnt display all of your private property then those nasty theifs
wouldnt go after it  And dont carry any money that way those muggers
wont bother you


And you still dont realize that either way it is says that homosexuals
are very dangerous to children

 
 So tell mewhats immoral about homosexuality

The promiscuity and fetishism that characterizes it  The sexual
predatory component that glorifies the pursuit of candyass and
hairless cocks in the words of Le JoJo the typical homosexual

Oh I did not know that Le JoJo is a typical homosexual

Stop making statements about something you know nothing about that is
gay people  You make your sweeping generalizations with no grounding 
in reality


What I hope is not true That you are a typical heterosexual  Anyone want
to comment on this

And if you are typical then I can start extrapolating a lot of interesting
conjectures about heterosexuals
