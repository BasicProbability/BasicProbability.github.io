Subject Re Winning Tax Case

dreitmanoregonuoregonedu Daniel R Reitman Attorney to Be writes
Which makes it legally unsound  If I were representing Mr Teel 
Id try a procedural approach if I could find one or recommend 
he pleabargain  Hes setting himself up to be in hot water

Indeed  Reading the cases of people whove tried the various things
Mr Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes 1 those
who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their
claim and 2 those who lose

Consider Newman v Schiff 778 F2d 460 8th Cir1985 which Ive seen
cited by tax protestors other than Mr Teel as a win for Mr Schiff
Mr Schiff offered 100000 on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return

Mr Newman took him up on it  Mr Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning  Mr Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast and so there was no offer
for Mr Newman to accept and so no unilateral contract was formed and
so Mr Schiff did not have to pay 100000

Mr Schiff was correct and so won  So yes Mr Schiff won against a
claim on the 100000 reward  However his win had nothing to do with
the tax code
