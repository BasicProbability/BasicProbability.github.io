Congress is NOT allowed to abrogate the constitutional rights and privileges 
already enjoyed by persons however unless the abrogation has a rational 
reason or a compelling interest to it depending on which standard is 
applied This is relevant because granting a right to one class of persons 
by definition ALWAYS impinges on the rights of another class or classes or
persons to some degree In the case of abortion establishing rights for
the unborn impinges GREATLY on the rights of pregnant women There has yet
to be presented a sufficient justification for such fetal rights

Not to your satisfaction But the arguments have convinced me and others
 
Mob rule isnt any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government
It aint charity if you are using someone elses money
Wilsons theory of relativity If you go back far enough were all related
