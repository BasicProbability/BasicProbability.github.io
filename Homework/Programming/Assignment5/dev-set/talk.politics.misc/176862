     The deficits declined from 849 reaching a low of 29 of GNP before  
  the tax and spending hike of 1990 reversed the trend

 Is this true   Some more details would be appreciated
 
 cheers

Actually not  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously
What declined from 84 to 89 as I remember it was percent
increaseindeficitgrowth ie the rate of growth of the deficit 
2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time decreased
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined  If you keep spending more than you earn the deficit keeps
growing  If you keep borrowing at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously the deficit increases  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts

Figgies book paints the real data pictorially in gory detail  Each
president essentially ran up twice as much total debt in half the time
Reagancongress was simply awful  Bushcongress was unbelievable

As a really rigorous aside to this thread

During pledge night the other night on the public channel there was an
economist who gave an hour or so presentation  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data I dont know his name but his
arguments were brilliant  He confirmed with data what many of us know
with common sense  the boom of the 80s has nothing to do with government
policy particularly supply side policy since taxes do not cause 
economic activities  People cause economic activity  More can be 
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
create cycles  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is
