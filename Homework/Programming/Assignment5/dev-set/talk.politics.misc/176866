Subject Sick and tired was Re Bill Conklin et al s letter

Replying to AJ Teel

	Well the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the
	Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for
	stopping withholding et cetera have been out there for a
	while now

Humbug  Those letters dont provide concrete proof of anything at all
in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu
ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations

Specifically show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that
income tax is illegal andor that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with
out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness  This
issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect
something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court in the case of
federal tax or a states supreme court for a states income tax

Unless you can do that I for one am unwilling to call your material
concrete proof

	There has been no refutation to date  Have the naysayers
	finally given up as defeated  Sure would like to hear their
	reasons for disbelief at this point

Refutation  Refutation of what  You havent made a case yet  Youve
posted plenty of claims but you havent given us any valid reason to
believe that any court in the US will agree with you  Your claims seem
on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I
feel the burden of proof is still on you to show that your arguments
have any merit whatsoever  And the cases youve cited involve such
strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are
applicable to anyone else or that they will ultimately stand on appeal
to the Supreme Court

Why cant you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe a regular
employee earning regular wages from a regular company refuses to pay
his income tax gets hauled into court is convicted of wilful tax eva
sion and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court
with a landmark 72 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally
voluntary  What you say  No such case exists  Hmmm I wonder why
not why havent you

	Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the
	opposition has forfeited the field

With all due respect you can conclude anything you want  I just hope
for your own sake that you dont conclude that anyone in a position of
authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit
ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions

For that matter I confess Im thoroughly confused as to why you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway  since I thought you
told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big
banking interests since the 1938 admiralty jurisdiction coverup thing
Do you honestly expect us to believe that theyd go to all the trouble
to subvert the system and yet would still promptly slink back into
their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right
combination of magic spells and mystic mumbojumbo

Not only that but why do you even care what the US courts say anyway
Didnt you tell us a while back that youve disavowed all attempts by US
officials to classify you as a 14th Amendment federal citizen  When
the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion why dont you just tell
them theyre out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington
DC where they belong

Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law which you
suggested would be better than all these statutes codes and the like
If you want to renounce societys legal framework fine we can just
declare you an outlaw OK and anyone who sees you driving on the roads
with no license plate on your car and no drivers license in your wallet
can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper with
plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1207

Sorry everyone its getting late and Im sick and tired of all this
garbage  If I know whats good for me Ill just clam up and stop try
ing to refute this nonsense and if anyone falls for it and winds up in
jail for tax evasion or whatnot itll be on their own head

Needless to say none of the above represents the opinions of my current
employer  who in any case is a Canadian and doesnt really need to
care too much about US tax law  I on the other hand am a 14th Amend
ment federal citizen with a US passport to prove it and plan to keep
on filing Form 1040s for the foreseeable future though I will probably
not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion
andor the foreign tax credit
