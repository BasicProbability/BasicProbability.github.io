 The left likes to dodge the issues of morality and behavior crying that
 anyone who raises them blames the victim  Nonetheless as a recent
 editorial in the Los Angeles Times pointed out the free love
 advocates of the 1960s have demolished the poor  Its one thing to
 have children out of wedlock if youre say Murphy Brown or someone
 like her turning over a six figure salary  and quite another if
 youre sixteen have no skills and no income

And how did the free love advocates of the 1960s manage to perform
this demolitionforced breeding programs or something

 By accepting and even celebrating single outofwedlock parenthood the
 1960s radicals espousing free love set the stage for catastrophe among
 the poor They must account for this

Now let me get this straight  After a nice long rant about how
people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
social lives all of a sudden 1960s radicals such as me I guess
are responsible for poor peoples lifestyles  Tell me how that
worksor do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
for themselves

There are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
support systems in general among this nations poor  Somehow I
dont think Murphy Brownor Janis Joplinis at the top of any 
sane persons list

You want to go after my generations vaunted cultural revolution for
a lasting change for the worse try socalled relevant or values
education  Hey it seemed like a good idea at the time  How were
we to know you needed a real education firstI mean we took that
for granted
