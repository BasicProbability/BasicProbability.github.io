     Plug this one in Im a Conservative I hate PeeCees although I
have to use one at work and am a proud owner of a NeXT Station

The real question Should the Feds bailout Steve Jobs  NeXT a la Chrysler
so that important manufacturing jobs wouldnt be lost
 

You have just reminded me of an old Tom Paxton song

IM CHANGING MY NAME TO CHRYSLER
Tom Paxton 1980

Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
What the dollar used to get us
Now wont buy a head of lettus
No the economic forecast isnt right
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray
I caneven glimpse a new and better way
And Ive devised a plan of action
Worked it down to the last fraction
And Im going into action here today

Chorus

  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am going down to Washington DC
  I will tell some power broker
  What they did for Iacoca
  Will be perfectly acceptable to me
  I am changing my name to Chrysler
  I am heading for that great receiving line
  So when they hand a million grand out
  Ill be standing with my hand out
  Yes sir Ill get mine

When my creditors are screaming for their dough
Ill be proud to tell them all where they can go
They wony have to scream and holler
Theyll all be paid to the last dollar
Where the endless streams of money seam to flow
Ill be glad to tell them all what they can do
Its just a matter of a simple form or two
Its not renumeration its a liberal education
Aint you kind of glad that Im in debt to you

Chorus

Since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime
Weve been struggling in an unrelenting climb
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking
And its sad failure is an awful crime
Its been that way for a millennium or two
But now it seems theres a different point of view
If youre a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
Down in congress there is a safety net for you

Chorus



Perhaps Steven Jobs should take Paxtons advice and change his name to
Chrysler or perhaps set himself up as an SL maybe Neil Bush could
give him a hand
