 We are told by US congresswoman Barbara Jordan that we are biologically
 incapable of compassion
Personally I doubt she said anything of the kind but if
someone can provide the ORIGINAL quote IN CONTEXT WITH SOURCE
for ahem crosschecking I would we willing to agree
she is full of sht  Naturally if no one can provide these
bits of data the paraphrase listed must be disregarded
and its poster regarded as full of sht  OK so which will it be

I followed up without a thought of doublecheckingif I doublechecked
every fact people vomited onto the table here on the net Id never have

that quote

well Michael  Take it away  wild applause
