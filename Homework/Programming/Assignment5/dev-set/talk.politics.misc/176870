 DISCLAIMER  All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else

Yes it was Nixon who was most vocal about giving money to Russia  It
makes me proud to be a libertarian  It appears both conservatives and
liberals prefer to cold war until you win then nurse the enemy back to
health for another go around

Its like subsidizing the wealthy countries Japan Germany etc with
free defense and then tradewarring with them because of the economic
competition  Its like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying
bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke

I ask myself what law could we pass to prevent government from doing
stupid frivilous things with OUR money  Then I think the Constitution
was supposed to do that  Could someone please tell me what legitimate
constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money
from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries  Seriously
