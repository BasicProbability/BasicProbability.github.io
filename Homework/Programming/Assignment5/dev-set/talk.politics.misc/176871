	If you are a United States Citizen and a resident of the
state then your citizenship is in DC and thus are a 14th Amendment
Citizen Are you a Citizen of the State in which you live If you are
a resident then you are not

So the only people who are citizens of a state are ones who dont live
in that state  So am I a citizen of 49 other states since I live in
California
