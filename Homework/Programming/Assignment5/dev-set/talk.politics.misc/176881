Subject Re Tieing Abortion to Health Reform  Is Clinton Nuts


In article C4z3xw3EFnewscsouiucedu parkerehsn21cenuiucedu writes
 I like the way people call it cruel and unusual punishment as if
 imprisonment isnt cruel too  Lethal injection pales in comparison
 And they have a death sentence because they were convicted of a cruel
 and unusual crime

Its not what they did that matters  Its what you do and
what I do and what we do in response that matters  Do we
lessen ourselves by killing in response to killing  Its
vengeance  Thats all  Its no deterrent  It serves no
purpose but to slake somebodys blood lust

 It would be nice though if we never convicted someone of a crime they
 didnt commit and it would make the death penalty much more justifiable

Yeah yeah yeah and sure would be nice if we didnt apply the
death penalty disproportionately to minorities  Ill revisit my
opinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for
it than blacks  Ie when hell freezes over
