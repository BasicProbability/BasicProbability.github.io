Subject Re Religion and homosexuality

 magarretmagnusacsohiostateedu COMPUTER DUDETTE writes

I just recently realized that I am bisexual and also just recently returned to
religion and have a good friend who has pointed out to me that homosexuality
is a sin in the bible  Well I dont see how it could be considered a sin

First of all as far as I know only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles so youre off the hook there I think In
any event there are plenty of people in many denominations who
do not consider a persons sexual identification of gaylesbianbisexual
as an immoral lifestyle choice

Also I have always been a somewhat liberal feminist and am prochoice and it
seems that being prochoice and being religious dont mix either  I am told

This is another misconception You are not being told the whole story

My former minister is a lesbian and I know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers I am
a UnitarianUniversalist and like most others in my denomination
am prochoice You neednt go looking to the Unitarian Universalists
which is a liberal religion for acceptance of your sexual
identification and prochoice views however there are many of us
who believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience

Good Luck on your journey
