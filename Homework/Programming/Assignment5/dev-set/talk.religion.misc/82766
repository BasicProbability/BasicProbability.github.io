Subject CHRISTIAN DEVIL REVEALED
From pharveyquackkfucom Paul Harvey

For a while I was puzzled by the the concept of Adam and Eve coming to
know good and evil  This is how I resolved it  Within Gods universe
each action evokes an equal and opposite reaction  There can be no good
without evil as an opposite  So the issue is not what you do but to whom
you give your allegiance  That is why even in this sinful state when we
perform an evil act while we are submitted to God He does not place that
sinful act to our account Rom 48 In the same vein you can perform all 
the good deeds in the book if your life is not under Gods control you are 
still sinning see Rom 1423

Now take a good look at at an tell me man there is no Christian
Devil There is is real is a virus a meme infecting and possessing
the good people and keep em from becoming human beings with emphasis on
the being Is not a matter of good people an evil people is all good
people see but some good people vexed of the Christian Devil An it
cant be burn out or lynch out or rape out Only wise up let I rise up
Christian Devil is real man how else can you explain five hundred years
of history even more Can only be explained by Christians invoke
Christian Devil
