Subject Re  The list of Biblical contradictions

In article 7912bluecispittedu joslinpogoisppittedu David Joslin writes
Many good points deleted Anyone who missed it should see the original
Lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to
make a bible verse salad just dont cut it  Those of us who
want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing
as embarassing as the fundies should find Josh McDowell

True except that Ive known few fundies who had enough sense to
be embarrassed by Josh McDowell

Okay maybe a cheap shot But Im in that kind of mood
