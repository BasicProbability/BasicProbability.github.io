Subject Re  The list of Biblical contradictions

joslinpogoisppittedu David Joslin writes

Im curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve
Lists like this seem to value quantity over quality an argument
from article length  And the list you have here is of poorer
quality than most

I agree which is why Ive asked for help with it

The reason Im working on this list is because Ive recently had one
too many Christians tell me the Bible contains no contradictions
whatsoever  They believe that its true and that it describes
reality perfectly and even predicts history before it happens

Before I can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these
people Ive got to SHOW them with concrete evidence that the Bible
is not nearly as airtight as they thought  I hope to do that with
this list

Specifically when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories I usually get blank stares or flat
denials  Ive never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation

    The meaning of life     Si je ne vaux pas mieux au moins je suis autre
     is that it ends                                            Rousseau
