Why would it be immoral to hurt someone else  

me
Because you wouldnt want it to happen to you

hudson
Why does that make something immoral



Because you are not being consistent  Moral systems must be consistent

A person who thinks they can inflict pain on others but doesnt want it 
inflicted upon themselves has a double standard  And double standards are
a violation of any moral system





me
Morality defines how we interact with other people the rules that we
use to guide our daily affairs  Our conduct towards our fellow man  By
realizing that we dont like pain we can also realize that other people
dont like it either  

hudson
Of course we dont like pain  I dont like brussel sprouts  Are brussel
sprouts immoral

Pain isnt immoral stupid  Pain itself is just a physiological
reaction  

What is immoral is subjecting unwilling individuals to pain

Or brussel sprouts for that matter






hudson
Is it immoral to produce these same chemical reactions in a test tube

me
It isnt the chemical reaction that is wrong bozo  Its making the human
being UNDERGO THE EFFECTS of the chemical reaction  Sorry your cute
little analogy didnt survive for very long under scrutiny

hudson
Why would it be wrong to make humans undergo the effects of the reactions
if humans are composed only of matter  

What humans are composed of isnt the qualifying criteria of whether or
not something would be wrong  




hudson
Is it wrong to make matter undergo chemical reactions

Yes if it is sentient matter



me
Nature is not a sentient force there is no choice involved  Therefore
no question of morality


hudson
I actually heard a geologist entertain the notion that matter had a will
There is some sentient force out there  

Fine  I have also heard that the government is encoding the DNA for 
a new race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water  

Whats your point



hudson
If humans are made only of matter then choices are also chemical reactions
so why is choice an important issue

And if that is the case then god is only an idea contained in the minds
of people formed of matter and on printed pages also formed of matter
and does not really exist  

I can do the argumentem ad absurdium just as well as you can but it 
wont prove any points for you or me  Got anything relevant you want to 
talk about or are you just playing cute little games
