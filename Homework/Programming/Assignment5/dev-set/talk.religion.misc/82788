Subject Re Religion and homosexuality

In article 1993Apr51824117621midwayuchicagoedu dsoconnemidwayuchicagoedu writes
First of all as far as I know only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles so youre off the hook there

Actually there is one condemnation of lesbian acts in the Bible Romans
126

I think In
any event there are plenty of people in many denominations who
do not consider a persons sexual identification of gaylesbianbisexual
as an immoral lifestyle choice

There are plenty who dont read the Bible
Or pray for that matter
