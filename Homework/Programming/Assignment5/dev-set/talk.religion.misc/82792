A poster writes

 In the Kingdom of God Vaikuntha the tigers do not eat other living
 beings In the material world everyone is trying to consume everyone
 else Therefore we all even tigers who are by no means invincible
 should try to get out of the miserable material situation and return to
 the Kingdom of God

	Is the socalled material world outside the Kingdom of God
	
 Right But unfortunately acting like animals is the number one pastime
 of modern human beings

	Aha animals are inferior and humans are superior
	Huh

	Isnt the desire to be superior so overwhelming
	that humans constantly put down even innocent animals
