Specifically when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories I usually get blank stares or flat
denials  Ive never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation

That is because two creation stories is one of the worst examples of 
a difficulty with the Bible  were formed can also be translated had been
formed in chapter two without any problems  So the text does not demand
that there are two creation stories  

Really  I dont get it Genesis first says that God created the
earth then the animals then humans then it turns around and says
that humans were created before animals  How can you escape this
contradiction
