 Subject TaurusSable rotor recall

        My 92 Taurus GL with only 26k on the clock also has rotor warp
    Apparently they HAVENT fixed the problem yet  But try convincing the Ford
    service person to fix it for freeRight

Gads I have heard so many horror stories with Taurus and Sable cars  I thought
these were premium American automobiles  The way they sell youd think so
Is Ford really no better than in the late 70s when it was turning out tin
cans like the Granada and the Fairmount  Which would you get a Taurus or 
a Camry or Accord
