I have 30000 as my budget  Im looking for a sports or GT car

What do you think would be the best buy  Im looking for specific models

Thanks
Danny


 Id say an RX7 would be RIGHT up there  You could easily deal down to 30
 It has some of the most impressive performance figures around and automotive
 magazines eat it up  One car to seriously consider in that price range
