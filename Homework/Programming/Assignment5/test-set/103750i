The next Mustang will be Fords highest profile car  It attracts
way more attention than the CamaroFirebird because its heritage
is more embedded in the general public  Dont lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that

FYI they already did

Oh really When

Too bad that the current Mustang cant even compete with the new
Camaro without using an active imagination

The 93 Mustang Cobra can Check it out

Right now few cars can compare with the 93 Camaro Think about it
20000 for a car that will out perform all but a few exotics
If you are now swearing at me look at the statsthey dont lie
 There are NO comparable cars in its class certinaly not for its price

Ehhhh maybe The 93 Mustang Cobra does a good job for a lower price
and its just a taste of whats ahead in the 30th Anniversary of
the original Pony Car

Unless the Ford gets the 32v 300hp Romeo  You dont seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only do you

Hey can you imagine the potential of a MODIFIED LT1
Folks in a few years we will surpass the levels of performance 
achieved in the late 60s thats scary

Just think Corvettes are almost up to the performance levels
of a 65 Cobra Wow In a few years they might be up to the
performance levels of a 66 Ford GT40 Wow man just think
about it
