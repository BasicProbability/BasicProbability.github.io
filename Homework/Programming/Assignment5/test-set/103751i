I looked at that Bimmer yesterday Its an 81 has about 90kmi according
to owner odometer stopped working at 68Kmi Drivess well sounds good
body is OK he wants 3000
i liked the car despite its auto tranny but my wife will be a primary
driver on this one and she wants auto
The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn 
The AC seems to have a leak
The sunroof is sticky but operational
Odometer does not work as mentioned before
Idle is a bit bouncy going from 900rpm to 1200rpm
Wipers are slow
Thats teh gripes The owner says that he changed radiator alternator
rotors and calipers exhaust
The biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty SOB telling strange
stories I hate that I would never buy from a persom like that except how
often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money He also said that
although I could bring a mechanicin he wouldnt let me check the car by taking

it to a garage Suspicious And who knows what milage is on it
So let me know what to check for given theres practically no rust
I know there was an article on 528i in RD a few years back anybody remembers
what issue

DONT BUY IT  All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches
later on  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably
know BMWs are not cheap to fix either  The owner sounds like a shady
character just trying to take advantage of someone Sure  3000 sounds good
but you should calculate how much the repairs will be It sounds like you
would have to sink in at least  1000 to get everything fixed if not more
Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned Who knows how many
miles are on it and how it was driven  Sure people tell you BMWs hold up but
you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear For all you know it
could have 200000 miles on it  The thing you have to remember is that this
isnt the last 528i around either Just wait and keep shopping For around 
50006000 you can probably find one that is better needs less repair and has
legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering Take it from a guy who
has been taken a couple of times Good luck
