I can put a 32valve V8 with twin Garret4s on Yugo and get 77sec QM
Thats useless  Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track
or on the street

A Yugo that will go 14mi in 77 seconds will not lose on the
street Thats just too damn quick It might be wrapped around
a telephone pole at the end of that quarter mile but it will
be there alone

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultralongthrow stick shifts of
the 50 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 I ll buy it in 6 mos 

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst shortthrow
shifter available from Ford Motorsport or any number of other
aftermarket products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro Can you do that with a 93 RX7 or verily with any
MR2 With the Detroit aftermarket you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 50 that sounds in every hairpin turn 

Well gee It works and it doesnt break It transmits power to
the drive wheels and its essentially zero maintenanceand theres
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rearends too

And bythe way 50 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks 
Hello  this is the 90 s 

Well the 93 Mustang Cobra which from all reports uses the
same running gear as 94 Mustang has 4wheel disks I cant
speak for the new Camaro but I think it does too

Also stop and think about the markets here The Mustang is and
always has been a massmarket sporty car thats where the
pony car class came from with a performance model Thats
why it has the econobox running gear That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby it was designed as a widemarket carsporty yet 
accessiblewith room for performance tweaking

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche
and they both fit those niches very well The Mustang at least
does well in multiple markets I cant speak for the Camaro
