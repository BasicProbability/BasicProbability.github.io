Subject Re Last of the V8 Interceptors Mad Max

	Tony  I believe first of all that Maxs car is an Austrailian
built car  I dont think its a chopped up US unit  It may be called a
Kangaroo or Roo or something similarnot sure  But I do recall reading
that Austrailian cars used Ford V8 engines  The Ford V8 Interceptor
is I think a 428 ci cop car motor  Whatever the case that small car
with a screaming big block Ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for
mileskilometers  I hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject
