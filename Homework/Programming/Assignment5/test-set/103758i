I thought that the V10 was originally designed for a truck not necessarily
a pickup and then just sort of dropped into the Vipers frame because
it fit and was available  A friend of mine and I saw and heard a Viper
and my friends first response was that it sounded like a truck  It sounded
fine to me but then again I dont like the whiny noise that most modern
sports car engines make  BTW the Viper we saw was moving at about 10mph
just like all of the other cars on the 10 freeway heading east out of LA
on a Friday afternoon  Looked really nice though

	Actually I was under the impression that the V10 in the Viper was
NOT the V10 that Dodge was developing for its new Kenworths  I have always
thought it was the exhaust system and not the engine that produced the noise
of a car

Well yes the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out but the
basics tone firing cadence etc are determined by the engine configuration
In the case of the Viper yes we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90deg
engine which will sound somewhat like a truck  And my understanding btw is
that that V10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad
aptible for either the trucks or the Viper  And from what Ive heard no first
hand knowledge   its doing a pretty good job at both

And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60degree
DOHC Colombodesigned V12  Period
