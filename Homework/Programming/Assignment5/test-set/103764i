 Im not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if 
 you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
 alarm  I can think of worse things in the world  Glad you got out of there
 before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun
 
I think people have a right to kill to defend their property Why not Be
honest do you really care more about scum than about your  car

I cant tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not but to be honest many
automobiles are worth far more to their owners in  value and  investment
than the people that would take them  I dont have figures on average property
tax in the US or how much of it is allocated for housing projects inferior
public schools jails or the like but I have a feeling that the amount the
government steals from an honest productive citizen to breed this trash is 
significantly less than the value of many automobiles  And for those who will
argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else not to
mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence such as rape cannot
be valued in terms of money because they are human beings I submit that they
are not human beings  Jim Callison I think is on the right track  And 
Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions
of a single criminal  I couldnt agree more  One could trace any crime back
to the environmentupbringing of the criminal should we let all of them out
from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders because what they did wasnt
their fault  Where does one draw the line
