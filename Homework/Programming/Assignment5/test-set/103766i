 Im not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons but I would ask you if 
 you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
 alarm  I can think of worse things in the world  Glad you got out of there
 before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun
 
I think people have a right to kill to defend their property Why not Be
honest do you really care more about scum than about your  car

Yo Watch the attributionsI didnt say that

Again this isnt an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you
should shoot someone for property damagevandalismtheft but every
responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits and the punishment
must fit the crime I mean think about itis a really harmless
prank worth killing over

As I said the situation described punks setting off alarms and
taunting people to come out could turn very ugly very quickly and
it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line
