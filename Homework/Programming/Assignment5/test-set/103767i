The big disadvantage of automatics is the 10 HP they consume that never
gets to the wheels  In this respect they are at a disadvantage to a manual

only when the torque converter is not locked up  there are autos out there
with converter lock up in 2nd 3rd and 4th gears

Wrt performance converter lockup is purely irrelevant  The lockup only
occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG  Mind you
a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG but the additional
mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration vs locked
converter clutch than its inherent losses take away
