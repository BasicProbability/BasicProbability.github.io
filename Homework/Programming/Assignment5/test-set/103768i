An excerpt from the blurb

   This fine Kubel clone from Wolfkam is a very close copy of
   the original and offers the same allweather and crosscountry
   capabilities as its WWII forebears  The robust fiberglass body
   kit is very complete and includes all the hardware you will
   need except for your own VW donor car  The phone number 
   is the entire ATT dialing sequence call and ask for Karl
   Torum or send 5 cash or International Money Order
   for a complete literature package
