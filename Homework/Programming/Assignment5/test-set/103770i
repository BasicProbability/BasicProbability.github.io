 i think that it is technicaly known as a 180 degree vee configuration
 could be wrongthis is how ive seen them referred to
 
     Then what is a Flat engine
 
 flat  180 deg V  horizonatlly opposed
 
 Usually it also equals boxer however I think the term is
 traditionally reserved for 8s and 12s and firing order matters
 This was talked about here in ra many months back I cant remember
 the consensus
 
 Examples
 
 Ferraris 512TR is a flat 12 boxer
 Porsches 911 is a flat 6
 Subarus Impreza is a flat 4

Not to inject a nonautomotive note to this thread but the BMW opposed
twin used in motorcycles for a long time is and always has been known as
a boxer
