 Examples
 
 Ferraris 512TR is a flat 12 boxer
 Porsches 911 is a flat 6
 Subarus Impreza is a flat 4
 
 i think you got it the other way round the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180
 degree v12 and not a true boxer while the subaru and porsche are
 true boxers  dont know about the vw bug though but i suspect that
 it is also a true boxer

Are you serious  The auto that had a lot to do with bringing the term
boxer to the popular forefront was the Ferrari 512 Berlinetta Boxer
or the 512BB Had a 5 liter opposed 12 cylinder engine
