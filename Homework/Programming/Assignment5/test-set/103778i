 Didnt the Saab Sonnett have a V4 I recall someone telling that it was
 something like 12 of a Ford 289
 
 Not only the Sonett correct spelling but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
 used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V4 from Ford of Germany  This particular
 motor had a 60 degree vee angle a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
 ports  This motor was later stretched into the V6 commonly seen in the
 Capri

I think it was the reverse the V4 being 23 of the V6

 The V4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size  But in the
 Saab it made too much torque for the transmission which had been
 designed for a 3cylinder 2stroke

It was also the worst engine that Ford Europe have ever made  bloody
awful reputation Its most successful application being the Transit
van

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 half a Stag V8 under license I believe but with 2litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph
