Subject Re Automotive crash test performance and maintenance stats

I wrote
Is there a resource available to the consumer comparing all of the makes
and models of automobiles trucks vans etc for survivability in a
crash of different severities

Also Ive found very little objective data comparing different
vehicles for handling pickup braking expected maintenance etc
I recall years ago Consumer Reports annual buyers guide was much more
informative in those aspects than it is now

Thanks to a reply from someone I looked a little further and found what
I was looking for  The April CR magazine has most of the above things
Despite recent articles here the ratings looked pretty good for
relative comparison purposes  Unfortunately the crash test comparisons
didnt include half of the cars Im comparing
Anybody know how 93 Honda Civic hatchbacks and Toyota Tercels fare in
an accident
