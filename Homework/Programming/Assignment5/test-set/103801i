 before you go in Find out the invoice prices of the car add a  
reasonable  
 profit for the dealer 200300 offer them that price and stick to  
 it
 
 Whoa  Watch your terminology  Dealer invoice is not dealer cost
 

Thats probably true but its the closest to it that youre going to get  
The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  
probably doesnt know exactly what it will be until all the factory   
kickbacks incentives etc are paid and that often depends on his volume  
at the end of the monthquarterwhatever It might be a funny munber but  
its all you have to start with except the sticker and anyone who pays  
sticker price is really being ripped off
