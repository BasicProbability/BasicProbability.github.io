One more way which works in manual trans cars Ive driven and it is my
personal favorite the other suggestions above are great but try this
one too  
 
While pushing the shifter gently towards reverse let the clutch out
slowly right to the friction point and the shifter will be pulled into
position If you do it right the car wont jump backward nor will the
gears grind You will just glide back

I can vouch for this method in my 1990 SHO  This is the only sure way of 
putting in the reverse without any problem every time
