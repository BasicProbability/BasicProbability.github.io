Ive owned a Saturn for and year and a half and didnt have the extended
warranty but just traded it in for a 1993 for reasons that I wont mention
unless someone wants to know  I opted for the 5 year60000 mile extended with
50 deductible  Its sorta like buying health insurance  You could say that
youre not sick now and havent been sick for a while but you cant guarantee
that you wont be sick tomorrow  A little money invested today is better than
being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it or having to pay a lot
more tomorrow than you can today

justify all you want  extended warranties are a ripoff high profit item for
the dealer  and you didnt buy 5yr60k you get 3yr36k free so what you
bought is 2yr24k  and you still have to pay 50 every time you use this 
great warranty  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs
ifwhen you need it  considering that your last car was only 15 years old
are you sure you will even keep this new one past its free warranty period
btw typical profit on extended warranties is around 80  thats right only
20 of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future
repairs that the group of extendedwarrantypeople collect
