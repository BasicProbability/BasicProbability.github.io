Well the Opel deal fell through

Now im looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buysell  Any
previous owners have any experience with these cars  Besides looking
for rustgood compressionlow miles and all the other usual car
things one looks for is there anything special about these cars that
I should watch out for

How about things like handlingperformancemileageetc  These cars
look hot to my eyes at least and bear more than a passing
resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagatosp which has to be one
of the most beatiful cars ever made

What is the difference between 240Z 260Z 280Z  The 280ZX is rather 
unappealing IMHO but the other cars are decent
Thanks again
