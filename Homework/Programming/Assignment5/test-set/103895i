With Spring upon us its time to start waxing again  I was wondering if anyone
had any suggestions about waxes and polishes  I know carnuba wax is often 
recommended on the net but I was wondering about the colored waxes to cover up
some minor scratches  Do the colored waxes give on overall good quality shine
Are they good for the paint or clear coat

What about Liquid Glass is it a clear polish which dries clear thus filling
scratches  is it good for the paintclear coat

Please post with both good and bad experiences  And hey lets name names 
brands here  


All gimmicks  Stick with plain ol carnauba wax thats nonabrasive
Eagle 1 Meguiars Turtle Wax and a few others are good examples
The colored waxes just color in the scratches so theyre not so 
apparent  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely
off with a cleanermild abrasive

Never tried Liquid Glass although I still have this sample they sent
me a few years back
