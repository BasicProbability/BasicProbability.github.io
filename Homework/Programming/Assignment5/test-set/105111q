 I watched the final inning of Bosios nohitter with several people at
 work After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
 middle someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove he
 wouldnt have had time to throw Riles out Yet the throw beat Riles
 by about two steps I wonder how many others who watched the final out
 think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand
 
 In this mornings paper or was it on the radio Vizquel was quoted as
 saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
 easily thrown out Riles that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
 final play more memorable  Seems a litle cocky to me but he made it
 work so hes entitled

i guess so
still thats kind of a stupid move IMO hed be singing a different
tune if he had booted it and the next guy up had hit a bloop single
stranger things have happened hey i used to be a big Dave Stieb fan
and unfortunately theres no such thing as an unearned hit 

cheers
