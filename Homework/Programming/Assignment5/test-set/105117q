 real long but good post on Yankee trades omitted
 
 I disagree on one point  Velarde  Yes maybe the Yanks should have let
 him develop but he rode the Columbus Shuttle way too many times to do  
so
 Probably the fault of George but no matter now  His usefulness is  
done
 he will not be able to develop into a good player this deep in his  
career
 at least I dont think so  His fielding is horrendous at 3rd maybe
 hed be good at short he cant his the curve at all and I think all
 his trips from New York to Columbus and back have demoralized him to the
 point that he just doesnt care  Get rid of him I saythe sooner the
 better for both the Yanks and Velarde

Velarde hasnt been to Columbus if I recall for about three
years  Granted he hasnt been a full time player but
when he does play Ive always thought he had a good bat
He might be demoralized about not playing full time but
he hasnt been shuttled around  I think hes been in New York
ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989 or 90 I
believe  
I dont think he is gold glove calibre but he doesnt boot
it around either  I think if Velarde is given a chance
he could become extremely productive  I dont have any stats
to back this up and I dont know if his Defense would
cost any games but I think he could help  and he has
this year  He has 3 HR already  Same goes for
Jim Leyrtiz  He has a big mouth but he does get
the job done when he concentrates  I think the situation
with Leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
superstar and he gets pissed about not playing  I
think he might have realized something when the Marlins
or Rockies didnt select him
The Yanks need to worry about the Bullpen right now
Kamieniecki and WickmanMilitello in the bullpen
Ouch  Im praying that the BP will return to last years
form
