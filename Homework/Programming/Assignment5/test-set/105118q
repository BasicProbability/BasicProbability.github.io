Subject Re Rule Book Trivia 2

Rule 709k states It is interference by a batter or runner when 
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base
 he runs outside the threefoot line or inside to the left of
the foul line and in the umpires judgment interferes with the field
er taking the throw at first base

The key word in the rule is and A runner isnt out just for running
out of the baseline Hes out for interfering with the fielding of the
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first Because the catcher
opted to throw the ball over the batterrunners head theres no inter
ference

Sorry I still dont buy it  Youre certainly right that the runner is
not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with
the play  But the argument here is over what constitutes interference
You certainly cannot infer from what youve quoted that the batterrunner
must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you havent posted
a definition of interference at all

IMO this calls for one of the approved rulings that go in small print
in the rulebook  Something like

APPROVED RULING
If in the judgement of the umpire the runner by running to the left
of the allowed path caused the fielder to make a bad throw blocks the
vision of the fielder receiving the throw or otherwise impedes the
defensive teams making a play on him the batterrunner shall be
judeged guilty of interference

or

APPROVED RULING
The runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes
contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball


In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor
rules trivia questionsince it cannot be authoritatively answered
