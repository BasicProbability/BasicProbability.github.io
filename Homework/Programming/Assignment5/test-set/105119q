Garys list of the ten slowest bats in baseball
8  Andre Dawson

What  Peter Gammons Andre Tremendous Bat Speed Dawson  Bat speed so 
great that Dawson has trouble hitting the ball to the right side of the 
left field line without counting to 100 before swinging  Bat speed never 
before seen from a 38yearold man much less from any Red Sox player to 
precede him

Yes thats him  Was I not specific enough

Just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that
they have a quick bat  Dawsons release is slow and he IS 38 after
all  He may swing early and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to 
the left side all the time but he swings slowly

As for me disagreeing with Peter Gammons Whoa  Thats never happened
before  Next thing you know Ill probably believe Dave Campbell is the
biggest imbecile even to come near a mic and that Ray Knight has
the IQ of drained crankcase oil



 
   Gary Huckabay    Outside  That was right down the bleedin pipe 
 Balder than any    Kenny  I realize I dont have great control but 
  Dave on the net   cmon  Gary that was a styrofoam cup  The    
      Really       plates a foot to your right  Throw the ball
