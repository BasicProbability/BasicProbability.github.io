From swedacssitdumichedu Sean Sweda
Subject Royals final run total


Ive been saying this for quite some time but being absent from the
net for a while I figured Id stick my neck out a bit

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL
team since the inception of the DH rule  ps any ideas what this is

They will fall easily short of 600 runs thats for damn sure  I cant
believe these media fools picking them to win the division like our
Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of
genius for the tradesaquisitions hes made
