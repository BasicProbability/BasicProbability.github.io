the best home run i have ever seen came off believe it or not
Roger Clemens sorry Val a couple of years ago he threw a ball to
Incaviglia which was literally at Inkys neck and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it after the swing Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ballhe didnt even turn around to look or
even get upset the ball hit the lights in the leftfield standard
some 70 or so feet about the Green Monster over 100 feet above the
ground total
 
truly an amazing shot

I was at that game behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the 
radar gun  The 1991 season was winding down and Roger didnt have his 
best fastball topping out at 8890 in contrast to Frank Tanana who went 
as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out Phil 
Plantier five times on the night  Inkys shot would have gone further
than any Ive ever seen if it hadnt crashed into the lights not the 
lightstand as you say over 100 feet high Roy Hobbslike and bounced 
back onto the field  That had to have been a 525footer if unobstructed
edging out Bo Jacksons drive off Oil Can Boyd to the top of the
centerfield bleacher back wall in 1988 for the best Ive seen personally 
I was sitting under that one
