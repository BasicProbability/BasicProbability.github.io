	This chatting about the best player of all time is pointless  You
cant compare players from different eras  

Of course you can  You just have to be careful about what conclusions
you draw

If you will notice the best
pitchers stat wise were in the 20s and 30s and the best all around hitters
probably came from the 40s to 60s  

Huh  The 20s and 30s were the worst decades for great pitching  Grove
Vance Dean and not a whole lot else  

As for the best allaround hitters statwise Ruth Gehrig Foxx Greenberg
Hornsby Cobb etc all played before the 40s  Statwise the 60s were 
a graveyard for hitters

Now we have a great number of great
pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders Also

How do you know  Which ones do you consider great

about fielding the gloves were much smaller than they are now in the early
years of baseball  Maybe a hitter like Sheffield with the 330 BA 30hr and
100 RBIEven though it was probably a fluke year can be compared to a Mantle
because the pitching Sheffield faces is faster and not to mention better The

So  Sheffield also has better shoes  More time between pitches  You can
run the comparison but there are lots of things to take into account

same could be said for Frank Thomas who is said to be the best hitter since Ted
Williams although Franks defense does suck

Well can we compare them or cant we

	All I am saying is that you cant compare players from different eras
if you want a best player try choosing best players from different eras That

Why  We can compare players to the standard of their era and we can
keep in mind eratoera differences without throwing up our hands in
despair

way there is reasonable basis for comparison

You havent shown us whats unreasonable about the MAntleSheffield
comparison that you yourself did
