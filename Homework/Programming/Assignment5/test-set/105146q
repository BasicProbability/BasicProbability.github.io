I feel that talking about speeding up baseball games is like trying
to keep signal to noise ratio high on recsportsbaseball  No matter
how much you talk about it or how reasonable your arguments there
will always be people who quote an entire article with signatures
to make a one line comment reply or woof  Whether through their
stupidity denseness or excitement and overeagerness to bless us with
their insight no matter what is said they will always keep doing it

Same with ballgames  No matter how much it might benefit the game for
the umpires to enforce the rules and for the playersmanagerscoaches
to stop wasting our time  it just aint gonna happen

Rudy

I agree
