These things should have been done a long time ago but it took a real 
businessman ex  Safeway President Peter Magowan to figure it out Just 
like he used to tell his checkers If the customers dont come back I dont
need as many checkers This isnt a knock on Bob Lurie  he was a competent
businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public

Interesting article Craig  Its amazing how hard it is to get baseball
teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their
customers  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century 
attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs  I guess the
owners look at baseballs high growth rate and ask why its necessary
to bring 20th century business practices into the game but they dont
realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they
pay in terms of longterm popularity by not doing better by the game
and its fans
