Subject Re Time of Game

The reason Im unhappy with the length of games today is summed up above
For an extra 15 minutesgame average in the AL and an extra 11 minutes
average in the NL Im seeing fewer runs score 

Now what I think I am seeing is more pitches  More strikeouts over
1game in the AL over 6game more in the NL more walks 2game more in

Yep  And the Ks dont have to denote a slow game either  Last night
Sid Fernandez was mowing the Giants hitters down 14 Ks in 8 innings
yet the first 7 12 innings of the game were quite brisk

He also threw 119 pitches leading me to believe it isnt just the
number of pitches that determines the length of a game but the 
behavior between pitches
