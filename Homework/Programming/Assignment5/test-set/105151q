 Im really a jester in disguise                                   
I hear ya  Then again we must remember that we are indeed Cub fans and
that the Cubs will eventually blow it  After all the Cubs are the easiest
team in the National League to root for  No Pressure  You know they will
lose eventually  Oh well I suppose we must have faith  After all they
do look pretty good and they dont even have Sandberg back yet  

CUBS IN 93
