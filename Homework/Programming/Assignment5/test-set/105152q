Subject Re Why is Barry Bonds not batting 4th

I dont understand this at all  Matt Williams has demonstrated
throughout his career that he will NOT wait for good pitches to hit
He wont take walks  Hed rather swing  If Im the opposing pitcher
why would I groove a fastball to Williams and have him hit it well
when I know that Williams will swing and miss or at least not hit
very well at a low and away curve

Matts problem is really more ability than attitude  It isnt that hes
got it in his mind that he wants to swing away but rather that hes
still a total sucker for the curve ball  It looked for a while in
1990 that he was getting better but its still his weak point

As to whether it does him any good to have Bonds behind him the 
netstatmavens will probably tell you theres no reason that it
should but if he thinks it will it might be a selffulfilling
prophecy

As to whether the Giants lineup is optimal  who knows  Batting Bonds
the teams best hitter fifth does seem to be odd but the 1 and 2
hitters arent exactly Messrs OBA so they arent giving much up
there  And although Clark isnt the overall offensive force that Bonds
is he seems better suited to the 3 spot  Assuming of course that
he starts hitting one of these days
