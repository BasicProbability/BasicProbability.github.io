I think that everything else being equal its not too much to ask that
if a weeknight game can be shortened by halfanhour by cutting out warmup
pitches dawdling outside the batters box commerical timeouts and that
sort of thing Im not asking for too much

How do you know they can be shortened by halfanhour  Has anybody done a
study to determine how much time is actually wasted  say in these As
games
