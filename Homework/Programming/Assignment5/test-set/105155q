But in the past a disputed strike call has been enough reason to step
out of the batters box  It may not be a good idea  It may even irritate the
umpire  But Ive seen it a lot and Ive seen it tolerated  Just not this
time

The key words here are in the past  Everybody was warned before the
season began that the umpires had been instructed to enforce the rule in
the interest of speeding up the game  

When I see this happening to other players Ill post a public apology to
Mr Hirschbeck  Until then I think this was a case of selective
enforcement
