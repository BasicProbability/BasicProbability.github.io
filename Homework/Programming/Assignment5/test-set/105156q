Subject How to start Cardinals Mailing list


OK  It would be a shame for Cards fans on the net
to go through the 1993 championship season without a 
mailing list to talk on so I would be willing to look
at starting one

Except theres one little problem

I dont know the first thing about how to do it or 
what it requires in terms of resources or time  So
if some kind soul could email me the particulars of
getting starting and managing a mail list Id see
if it would be feasible for me to start a Cards mailing 
list

Thanks in advance
