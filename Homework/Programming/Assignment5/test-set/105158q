I think that everything else being equal its not too much to ask that
if a weeknight game can be shortened by halfanhour by cutting out warmup
pitches dawdling outside the batters box commercial timeouts and that
sort of thing Im not asking for too much

How do you know they can be shortened by halfanhour  Has anybody done a
study to determine how much time is actually wasted  say in these As
games

Oh probably

Ms Nichols has given the average game times and average runs scored for
1983 and 1992  A very nice piece of information Ms Nichols  Who knows
She may be listening and not have me in her kill file after all  Those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of halfarun less being
scored per game and the games taking 15 minutes longer  Something is
being done now that wasnt done ten years ago which is extending the games
by 15 minutes  Ms Nichols thinks its more pitches  Given the increasing
specialization of pitchers it wouldnt surprise me

If its not simply more pitches though I dont think its unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back  Then
I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules
which have been stated in other posts in this thread and other related ones

The problem is who decides whether that time is wasted  You dont seem
to think it is at all  Right now I think it is although I have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs the
difference in mounds between the field and pen  but who knows  If the
rules get changed maybe something I didnt foresee will happen to change my
mind  But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing
or else nothing will be changed
