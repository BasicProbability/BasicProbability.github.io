When I say black I mean USborn black people for the purposes of this
discussion  Hispanic players were in baseball before 1947 and one 
team in the 50s signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did  

What about black hispanics

Good question  Its my impression not backed by evidence that general
southoftheborderness seems to exempt one from the hiringfiring effect
I was talking about  

Back in the 20s there were some attempts to hire black Cuban ballplayers 
they were rejected by the commissioner and others

And why would more hispanics stick around than blacks

Dont know  But remember this is the country that had special racial
			    
laws for one group and one group only blacks  Our national history 
 

Man you had better do some SERIOUS reading I really really doubt that you
meant to say this

Well what did I mean to say  Aside from some shortlived exceptions
such as Japanese internment in WW II only blacks were affected by laws
regarding slavery Jim Crow miscegenation military service etc  If
my claim of exclusivity is not 100 airtight that is if you can come
up with this or that exception fine  have a cookie  But compared to
this list no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth
discussing at length

Roger
