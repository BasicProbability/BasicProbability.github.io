 This weeks play
 

It took three days to get to us but Ill try anyway as I naturally
havent seen the answer

 With runners at first and second and one out the batter hits an
 easy pop fly to the third baseman
 
 A The umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman
 lets the ball drop The runner at second heads for third and the
 third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who tags the bag
 before the runner

SAFE The correct call is Infield Fly batter out if fair Runners
may advance at own risk Gotta tag up if caught etc It is not a
force and the pop was not caught so regardless of whether the SS
tags 3B or 2B it wasnt clear above he hasnt got the runner out

 B The umpires dont declare the infield fly rule and the third
 baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop who
 tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and
 third

OUT See rule 605L APPROVED RULING Below In this case the
umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule
doesnt apply Sounds like a bad call here but thats not the
point The batter is not out so a force situation is created
Therefore the runner is out   UNLESS by rule 605L the ball is
dead AND the batter is safe then I guess the runners would advance
unmolested  I cant really tell from 605L that the ball is dead in
this situation

 
 Whats the call in A and B

Pertinent rules 200 Definition of Infield Fly When an Infield fly
is called runners may advance at their own risk If on an infield fly
rule the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball the ball remains
in play despite the provisions of Rule 605L The Infield Fly rule
takes precedence

605L A batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair
fly ball or line drive with first first and second first and thrid
or firstsecond and third base occupied before two are out The ball
is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base
or bases APPROVED RULING In this situation the batter is not out if
the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground
except when the infield fly rule applies
