Subject Re How to speed up games marginally realistic

To really speed up the game umps need to START CALLING STRIKES the way
they used to  Im talking about making the strike zone start at the
knees and go up to the top of the letters  Forget this the strike zone
is in the general area of the groin  A lot less 3and2 counts and a
quicker game
