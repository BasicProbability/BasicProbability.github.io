 This brings back the long suffering memories of prechop Braves fans who
 kept being promised the Bob Horner  Dale Murphy back to back power slam  
 Who could stop that  Guess well never know

Why not Horner played 130 games in 1985 and hit 27 HR
Murphy played 162 and hit 37
In 1986 Horner hit 27 in 141 games and Murphy hit 29 in 160 games
and the Braves lost 96 and 89 games
