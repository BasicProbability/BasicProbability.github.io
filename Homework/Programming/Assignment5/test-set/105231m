Subject ZX11 Help

I need help getting my ZX11 C3 to behave  Ive managed to get
the front suspension to be very happy but the rear sucks  I cant
do anything with it to make it feel ok  The bike is very stable
through the corners I think because I have the front just right
but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous  It feels
like it actually amplifies the bumps  And the damping doesnt seem
to do anything in reallife although you can tell the difference
when the bike isnt moving  Ive tried 45 cm of sag from
completeley unloaded but I dont know which way to go  Has anyone
gotten the rear of this bike comfortable  And if so what kind of
settings esp what sag did you use  I like to corner but I also
would like my kidneys to remain intact  This thing makes the new
ZX7 feel comfy
