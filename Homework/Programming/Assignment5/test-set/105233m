Subject Re Battery storage  why not charge and store dry


     Quite right your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
most of their charge if drained and dried well but Id throw out the
electrolyte and buy some more when you need it


     And before anyone says Im wrong remember that new batteries almost
always come ready charged and dry and they are perfectly OK even after
several years storage at the shop
