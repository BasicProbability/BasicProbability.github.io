I dont generally consider police officers the enemy  I hope you dont
think bikers in general have that attitude  Stereotypes suck either way

  Ill entertain questions but my answers will reflect Georgia law and may not

You shouldnt get flamed for being a cop  I cant promise you wont because
there are jerks on this newsgroup same as any other but if youve been 
lurking for a while you already know that  You might get lots of flames
if you try to convince people that you know more than them just because you
have a badge  And of course you will get a moderate amount of flamage
just for expressing an opinion no matter what the opinion is somebody
will flame you for it
   So have you ordered any official DoD paraphenalia yet  Wristwatch
bandana patches  Tell your boss your going undercover with a real
badass biker gang
