 I plan to switch to a single fire ignition in about a month and was
 curious if anyone has experience with the supposedly new Crane single
 fire that competes with the DynaS  The club wrench not the wench has
 done DynaS modules for several friends and Ill get one also unless
 a bunch of folks say the Crane is better
 
 One guy just installed the MC Power Arc ignition but has not yet
 reported the results  It was not a simple boltin replacement as new 
 mounting holes had to be drilled
 
 I recognize its more fun to discuss why Chris needed to change brands of
 penis enhancer but how bout some comments on single fire ignitions for
 a while

I just installed a MC Power Arc II and it seems to run great I also
used MC coils and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC A little soldering
and all was fine Static timing was real easy to set too 

On the other side of the coin my local wrench whose opinion I
invariably seek but dont always adopt thinks MC Power Arc is a piece
of shit and says all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day 
Needless to say he doesnt like any electronic ignition modules and
recommends the DynaS system I think thats the one with the
Halleffect timing sensors correct
