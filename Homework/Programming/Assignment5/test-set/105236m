Reminds me of a great editorial by Bruce Reeve a couple months ago
in Cycle Canada

He was so pissed off with cops pulling over speeders in dangerous
spots and often blind corners that one day he decided to get
revenge

Cruising on a factory loaner ZZR1100 test bike he noticed a cop 
had pulled over a motorist on an on or off ramp with almost no
shoulder  Being a bright lad he hit his bikes kill switch
just before passing the cop who happened to be bending towards
the offending motorist thereby exposing his glutes to the
passing world

With his ignition system now dead he pumped his throtle two
or three times to fill his exhaust canisters with volatile raw fuel

All it took was a stab at the kill switch to relight the ignition
and send a 10 flame in Sargeant Swells direction

I wonder if any cycle cops read Cycle Canada

	Although I agree with the spirit of the action I do hope that
the rider ponied up the 800 or so it takes to replace the exhaust system
he just destroyed  The owners manual explicitly warns against such
behavior for exactly that reason  you can destroy your muflers that way

One more good reason for straight pipes or megaphones

Within the span of the last few weeks I have heard elements of
separate threads which in that they have been conjoined in time
struck together to form a new chord within my hollow and echoing
