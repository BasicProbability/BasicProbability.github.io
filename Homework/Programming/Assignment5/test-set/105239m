Hello Folks

Im very happy with my new R80GS  My range is 238 miles on 48 gallons
thats 50 mpg  Surprisingly the bike is a real cruiser  I was expecting
something rough   Shes a sweet backroad honey  And I can go pretty much
anyplace Id take my mountain bike  As far as shaft effect its more a 
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion  Rev it sitting still
when the driveshaft is not moving and the bike twists a bit  Maybe

If the clutch is in then a large chunk of counterrotating mass is not
rotating  Hence at a light reving makes it twist  Shaft effect is the
rear end rising under power or the real problem getting lower to the road
when the throttle is snapped shut say when you are cornering and the heads
are real close to the road  New GS bikes with the paralever shaft have
almost no shaft effect

I dont ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence  Okay here are 
my questions

1 Any recommendations for a homemade fairing  Id like to keep the
wind off my chest and perhaps my helmet for comfort at highway speeds
70 mph yet dont want to a screw up the stability or b block my
vision too much for trail riding  Anybody have luck with twopiece 
detachible fairings  Id like to make it myself out of plexiglas

2 I run two lights the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar  The illuminations excellent that way with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor left side the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right and it 
really picks up the periphery deer lurking etc  Combined with the 
headlamp on high you can see like day  But Ive heard that BMW alternators
dont crank out too much  Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when Im
puttering around in the dirt at low RPM  

Its a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need the
extra light  At low RPM 3K and under they dont charge all that much if
at all  The alternators put out sufficient wattage it just that you need
to be at 4K RPM to get it  

3 This is embarassing Im having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning  I invariably flood the carbs then go in and read a section
of the paper and then she starts right up  Is this a Zen thing 

Full choke  Open the gas taps  Hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the
throttle  It should fire  Cranking should be done with minimal throttle
My R100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle

Its an EXPERIENCE thing  Like Zen its hard to describe  It can be hard
to learn if you arent paying atttention to the differences between success
and failure  Especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the
battery while trying to get it to run

If my bike has been sitting for a few weeks I give it a short while to
start  If it doesnt I turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to
vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off  Ive got dual
plugs which make it easier to start

4 The Haynes manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives Yeah right  What do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol  Any 
particular brands of gas that are best  Additives

The BIG fix is the Bing carb upgrade kit  Its good for a few MPG and the
parts are alcohol proof  The parts it replaces arent alcohol proof  As
long as the bike isnt going to sit for long periods of time gasohol is
nice since it helps keep ping away  If your bike doesnt ping on cheap gas
you ought to raise the compression Half a smiley the BMW twins of the
80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the EPA happy  Dual plugs
and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance
