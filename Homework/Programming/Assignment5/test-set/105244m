 My 83 Nighthawk has two related problems with the ignition system
 
    it wont start when on cold mornings  10 C 50 F or so
    I always need to give it gas when starting it even when using
     the clutch
 
   This all still happens after a tuneup and a new battery 
   any ideas on what could be wrong with the bike

I think you have the choke starter jet blocked and even the idle one
