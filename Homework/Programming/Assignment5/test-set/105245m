Subject 1st time Biker iso ADVICE


Im just starting out with motorcycles  Ive read up on the subject a bit
talked to many of my friends who ownride bikes and encourage me to do the
same  But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at i get
varied answers


Im 63 about 230 largeathletic build  I suppose that would help to
determine the size bike id want  I want something thats going to be fast and
powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once im used to it  I also want
something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out  Any ideas
