 I was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in Milford NH with an assortment
of other nedod folks when Dean Cookson  yes he has not left the 
country yet mentioned that the wiring diagram of the VFR750 
shows that  the light switch is a three position switch 

high beam
low beam
Both beams


Well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
2 position switch but sure enough as Deam expected  when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on

This provides a very nice light coverage of the
road

This is true for the St11 and the VFR750 and I would expect for any 
other late model Honda with the standard two position light switch


Its a make before break type of switch  If not required it ought to be
for highlow beams  

There might be a wee problem with this  If you use both filaments at the
same time the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal
Possibly enough to shorten its life span  My Honda CRX cage a cage that
really wanted to be a bike had wimpy stock lights  So we used to run
around with both beams on  Made a mucho big difference  until both low
beam filaments died nearly simultaneously  This was two weeks after
finding out how nice it was to use both beams  I replaced the lights with
quartzhalogen lights and that ended the problem
