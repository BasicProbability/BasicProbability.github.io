Is it possible to do a wheelie on a motorcycle with shaftdrive

Mike Terry

Ive seen em but the real question is can one do a wheelie on a Lead Wing
If so how high would the front wheel be off the ground 

Graeme Harrison 

  There was a guy around here who would do them on an early pre fairing
Wing with a Hannigan He would get it right up and ride a ways Pretty
intimidating sight 

  He was real good He had to be I guess you wouldnt get away with
chopping the throttle more than once
