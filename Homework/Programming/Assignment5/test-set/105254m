Subject Re CB750 C with flames out the exhaust


Hey the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse see Raising Arizona had flames coming
out of both his exhaust pipes I love to toggle the kill switch on my Sportster
to produce flaming backfires especially underneath overpasses at night its
loud and lights up the whole underpass
