Also remember that its much more draining and tiring to ride 2up
than by yourself because youre concentrating on much more and
in the Zen of the moment less  Remember this

The first few times I pillioned someone whose safety was a great concern to
me as opposed to brothers etc I almost got us both killed on several
occasions

I was surprised to discover that it is much safer to just drive than to
distract yourself by trying to be unusually cautious and concerned  Abruptly
adopting a novel set of thought patterns and riding strategies while piloting
a bike is just asking for trouble
