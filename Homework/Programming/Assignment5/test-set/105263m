A friend of mine whos probably reading this right now just bought a new
Yamaha Virago 750  After spending 12 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts had to remove the right peg loosen
the brake pedal c c Ive pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oilfilter
for me  Compared to the 5minute change he was used to for his Honda this
is just a design flawoversight in my eyes

Sure dont know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasnt a
Virago  Ive owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter
change in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed  Obviously the
new bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on
  Watching for imitators
