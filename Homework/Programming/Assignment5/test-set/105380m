Subject Re Battery storage  why not charge and store dry

In Article 1993Apr2218490624025mnemosynecsduedu mfoxnyxcsduedu mark fox says
 
      Quite right your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
 most of their charge if drained and dried well but Id throw out the
 electrolyte and buy some more when you need it
 
 
      And before anyone says Im wrong remember that new batteries almost
 always come ready charged and dry and they are perfectly OK even after
 several years storage at the shop

Makes sense to me after all when steel is manufactured and stored they
put oil on it so it wont rust Logicaly when you store your bike you
must strip the paint and put oil on the metal to prevent rus
