It sure would be nice if someone would start making replacements
for OEM exhausts that were would be cheaper but not louder

I read about a SuperTrapp system called EAR that was supposed to be
quiet enough to pass some European standards  Apparently its not
on the market yet

Yoshimura makes a few systems that are supposed to be kind of quiet
They are also really light  Im planning on getting one of these 
systems soon and will post the results
