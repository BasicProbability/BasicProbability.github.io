 You know I wasnt EVEN going to respond to this typical antiparty
attitude message Trash was everywhere  reason Not enough dipsy
dumpsters for the massive crowd Oatman wasnt prepared for the vast
number of PEOPLE that showed up

I dont think Michaels response was antiparty but rather proenvironmental
I agree that you gotta let us Hogs out to roam every once in awhile  Lets
hope that next year Oatman will be better prepared and that we all pick up
after ourselves

an asshole Ive already admitted Im an asshole many times on the net
All my friends are assholes too lyrics to a new song So you want a
dime to call someone that cares

Well I for one thought you told a good story even if you say you are an
ahole We need more biker experiances written to news  Its unfortunate
that you got flamed for telling it but we all know this is a controversial
group

At any rate keep up the good work and continue to post stories
