I second the commend from Dr Speed get a new tire  Its like your
brakes something you dont want to take chances with  I waited too long
to take care of my front tire once and it went flat on me doing 70 MPH
going down the grapevine towards Bakersfield  At that instance I would
of given any amount of money for a new tire  Im lucky to be here
