Im looking for a sportcruiser  factory installed fairings 
fullhalf  hard saddle bags 750cc and above and all that and still
has that sporty look

I particularly like the R100RS and K75 RT or S or any of the K series
BMW bikes

I was wondering if there are any other comparable type bikes being
produced by companies other than BMW


The Honda ST1100 was designed by Honda in Germany originally for the 
European market as competition for the BMW K series  Check it out
