Might I suggest that a more appropriate forum for gamebygame highlights
of a particular team is a mailing list rather than recsportbaseball 

	I looked up might to see why you selected that particular word
and discovered the line    to express permission liberty
probability possibility     It also said something about being a
polite alternative to may  The presence of probability possibility
can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection  
So Id say to all extents and purposes Yes you might  In fact you did
Not that you were asking me specifically

	The next question is why would a mailing list be more appropriate
We dont all get mailing lists  We surely dont all get mailing lists about
the teams about which we are most enthused  So it seems to me rsbaseball
is an appropriate place to look for information about teams one doesnt
necessarily follow daytoday

	This is not intended as flamage but rather is an attempted answer
as you posed your post as a question
