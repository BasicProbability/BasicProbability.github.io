Subject Re logic of backup

So I think there are 2 possibilities

   1 Im right  If my disk really crashes I would at least have to
      reinstall DOS and Windows to get the backup program working

Using the software youre using I agree with you there  What I did
I installed DOS Windows and CPBackup functionally the same
as your Norton for the purposes of this discussion and used the 
DOS backup command on just that much  To restore I boot to the 
system diskette and use DOS restore to read in that much then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using CPB Norton in your
case overwriting what Ive just restored  That allows me to keep
this skeletal Windows essentially unchanged with all my customization
on the real copy done using the 3rdparty backup utility

   2 Im wrong  There is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk
      that can easily restore its state from scratch

Seems possible if you can put skeletal versions of DOS and your backup
utility on a system floppy  Then you could restore it all on one go
