Excuse me Are you one of those people who enjoy working wwin Come talk 
to a housemate of mine and tell him how productive his life is when he 
encountered yet another sudden appearence of the DOSprompt while cutting 
and pasting in win Or an empty win screen without any tasks running ie
ESC brings up an empty list progman has done it again

Sigh

Dont know what your roomate is doing but it must be something wrong
Are there people who enjoy using Windows Yes Ill admit to it Given
a choice between a Mac and Windows I choose Windows every time to
start another flame thread 9
