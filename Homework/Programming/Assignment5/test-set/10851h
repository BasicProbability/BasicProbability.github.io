Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac disks  
Ive never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I cant say that it works cause it doesnt read 800K
disks it only reads 144Mb If there a program that does read 800K disks
please let me know


The easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network 
This is much easier going from a Mac to a PC because you dont have to worry
about losing the resource fork of the file often a problem when sending binary
files from a PC to a Mac
