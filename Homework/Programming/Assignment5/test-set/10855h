 So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
 quality MS has made their life easier and more productive and to them
 that is quality They do not care about what innovative things MS has
 done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
 easier You may know better than most computer users in this world
 but that will not change their perception

Excuse me Are you one of those people who enjoy working wwin Come talk 
to a housemate of mine and tell him how productive his life is when he 
encountered yet another sudden appearence of the DOSprompt while cutting 
and pasting in win Or an empty win screen without any tasks running ie
ESC brings up an empty list progman has done it again
