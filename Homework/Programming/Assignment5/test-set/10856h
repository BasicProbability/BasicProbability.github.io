 Another comment  At least you have IBM consultants trying to help
 Ive never heard of Microsoft sending customer engineers to a
 clients organization to help solve problems  Could be wrong but if
 they do its not common knowledge

Microsoft has a division called Microsoft Consulting that does what
IBM FEs field engineers do

However neither company just up and sends consultants to client sites 
Both companies charge very high hourly rates for onsite consulting unless
the client has already paid an annual service contract
