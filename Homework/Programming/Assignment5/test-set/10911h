System 7 easier to learn and use  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect
OS2     Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking
NeXTSTep easier to learn use and program More stable multitasking
UNIXX   As easy to learn and use  More stable multitasking
	   Also more customizable I can make the computer do what I want it to do
Whereas with MSW I have to do what microsoft wants me to do
