If someone has downloaded the PCTools demo from Compuserve
please upload it to CICA or other FTP site

Thanks

Sorry I dont have the demo but I do have the program and have been
using it for the past few weeks  Since I now have Dos 6 as well I
dont use many of the features of PCT4Win  But I do so use
	 the PCT Desktop with drag and drop printing folders in
          folders and multiple desktops
	 the file manager which is far superior to win 31s fm
