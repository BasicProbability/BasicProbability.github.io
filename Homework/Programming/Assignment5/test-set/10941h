Subject Terminal woes

I have a 48633 VLB machine with a Wang 9624 faxmodem
When using the windows terminal application the only way
I can get it to see the modem is to change it to COM2
then go back and change it to COM4  Then it works fine
I have it set to COM4 as the port to use  I dont have
anything plugged into COM2 and Ive looked over the manual
for all its worth but what am I missing  The modem is 
jumpered for COM4IRQ3 which I understand means I cant
use the second serial port and the modem at the same time
but Im not using the second serial port anyway
Also when using Procomm  for DOS it always sees the modem
and dials but doesnt always connect me when the other end
answers  Dont know if that helps any

Thanks
