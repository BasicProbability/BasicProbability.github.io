If these personal attacks are what stopped Prof Denning from
replying on issues of substance they have cause real harm
to the serious debate here

They are and they have

Are you in contact with her is that what she said or what you THINK
her reason is

Also could it be possible that she is not replying because she has
no reply that wouldnt confirm the worst suspicions  If the suspicions
are way out of pocket one would think the person would be in there
saying so and indicating WHY they are out of pocket  Hiding behind
a veil of secrecy is not reassuring
