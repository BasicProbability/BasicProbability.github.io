Subject SUMMARY DES init vector as additional key

At the risk of getting lost in the clipper chip discussion I give a  
summary on my recent question

In article PQSCBCNHminniezdvunimainzde I wrote
 The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search
 attack  
 against DES is quite feasible now But normally DES is applied in CBC or 
 CFB  
 mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes Questions
 
   Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key Then
 we have  
 a 56  64  120 bit key
  
   If yes Is anything known about the security of this key scheme Can 
 we  
 break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space

Unfortunately the answer is no  concealing the initialisation vector  
essentially doesnt give any additional security I got 3 answers from  
gradynetcomcom MarkLomasclcamacuk smbresearchattcom that  
opened my eyes Its pretty simple

Say E is encryption and D decryption with key K on 64bit blocks

Let c0 be the initialisation vector
m1 m2  the message blocks
c1 c2  the cipher text blocks

Then encryption in cipher block chaining CBC mode works by the formula

   ci  Emi XOR ci1

and decryption by

   mi  ci1 XOR Dci

So if the attacker doesnt have c0 this only affects the first message  
block m1 But she can do her key search attack on m2 m3 

The situation in cipher feedback CFB mode is a bit more complicated but  
similar and left as an exercise for the reader 

Finally there is the modified output feedback mode OFB where DES or  
whatever block cipher you use simply acts as random generator by

   si  Esi1 with initialisation vector  seed s0

and encryption is given by

   ci  mi XOR si

Here the usual known plaintext attack against XORbitstream ciphers  
reduces the cracking to key search for K
