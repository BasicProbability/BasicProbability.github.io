Subject Re Is it illegal to transmit encrypted data

  Im afraid I have to disagree with you on that point  NSA will not
 tell RSA or any other nonDOD entity anything that its eavesdropping
 reveals

  I dont know about that they might if they find it the most expedient
way to keep people from using something they cant crack
