Subject Cryptography Bibliography

Yesterday I read an article from someone who was requesting references for
introductory texts on cryptography  Although I marked the article to
return it appears to have expired on this site

Anyway on one of the previous occasions when this subject arose I saved
a couple articles which made suggestions  One of the articles contained
a quite impressive bibliography  If the poster of the request or anyone
else would like to email me I would be glad to send out copies of these
recommendations including the bibliography
