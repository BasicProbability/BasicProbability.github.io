Subject Re Clipper Not Good Enough for Government

 

This is stupid  Wont it cost more to those companies hoping to 
serve the govt and private markets if they DONT use the same
technology

        I would guess that they wont use Clipper at all  What they will
do is use their STUIIIs amoung themselves and the governmental agencies
they need to talk to and ignore Clipper  After all if its not secure
enough for the agencydepartment they are communicating with why should
the coprations trust it
