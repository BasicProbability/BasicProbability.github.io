Subject Re How to make this illuminating thing

In article 1rn458INNgujdns1NMSUEdu jchodantenmsuedu CHO writes

My father having worked for American Cyanamid for sometime did mention
that the recipe is a secret Neither of us know of just how toxic
the stuff isbut you can synthesize a simliar substance that is
available to just about any organic labcalled Luminol  You can usually
find this in an organic lab book or something similiar 

These substances are normally not the secret but how to get at them The 
method of preperation is normally patented which means that noone else can 
make the chemical in the same way without undergoing an agreement with 
American Cyanamid But I guess you knew what a patent is  

If you know what substance is used youll also know its toxicity

Rumor has it that luminol is some base form for the stuff used in the 
light sticks

The Luminol reaction has the disadvantage of not lasting as long as the 
commercial version

Remember that cyano compounds are found in nature and not all are poisonous
