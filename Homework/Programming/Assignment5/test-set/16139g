Subject Re Is it illegal to transmit encrypted data

  Im afraid I have to disagree with you on that point  NSA will not
 tell RSA or any other nonDOD entity anything that its eavesdropping
 reveals

  I dont know about that they might if they find it the most expedient
way to keep people from using something they cant crack

Lets put it this way they have a charter and several executive orders
to obey among other things which explicitly prohibit sharing this
information unless things have changed withing the last little while
I suppose they could ignore it if they choose  But I doubt they would
For an authoritative look at the NSA get Bamfords The Puzzle Palace
Thats all I can say
