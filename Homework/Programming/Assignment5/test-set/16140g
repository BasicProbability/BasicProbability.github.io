        Looking at it from up here in the Frozen North it looks like
        you could do worse than get the NRA involved They have a
        kindred problem a large number of voters the right attitude
        and lots of funds

They also have a lot of the other voters really irritated at them

        From an ethical or constitutional viewpoint I havent seen
        a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesnt also
        support the NRA position on guns and viceversa

Okay folks I know Im in the minority on this issue but I cant
let this assertion go unchallenged yet again  Im going to say this
ONLY ONCE in the hopes of NOT starting a flame war off of the main
topic

Guns are offensive  Cryptography is defensive  See the difference
The only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else  Crypto
graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you

Sorry for the digression  Lets not forget the issue that we DO
agree on We want continued access to crypto technology of our
choice without key registration
