I heard somewhere cant name the source that TEMPEST does not necessarily
pickup just CRTs but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip  If
that is true the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be pickedup from the video controller  Can anybody verify
or refute this

Anything can be an emissions problem right down to the video cable  Given
the right equipment you can pick the screen paint from the cable  But
given any cable you must know what is being sent through it to know the
format of the signal as well as how many wires etc
