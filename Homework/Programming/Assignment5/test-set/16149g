      Just a random passing thought but can anyone cite a documented use
   of encryption technology by criminals and terrorists
      Excluding the IranContra Gang

Just a couple of days ago I heard on the radio news that a NeoNazi
organization had set up a BBS to keep its members informed  According
to the radio man the Nazis were using encryption to reduce their risk
if they were prosecuted  No I do not have any more information

Have fun
