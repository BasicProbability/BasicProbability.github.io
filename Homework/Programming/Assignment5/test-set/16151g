 I have seen various references to triple des recently Could anyone
 tell me what it is  From context I would guess that it means
 encrypting each block 3 times with a different key each time but
 Id like to be sure

 Replies by email preferred  our news is unreliable

as well as Im sure others including myself would like to hear them

Thanks

Jon
