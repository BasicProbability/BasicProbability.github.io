about scanning clipper and reverseengineering the algorithm
Am I missing something obvious here What could have the government done
to address this possibility Do they really care if it stays classified

	Yeah youre missing the obvious fact that since the algorithm
is classified if you reverse engineer it from the chip and later
publish it or build a compatible chip youre divulging classified
information and are in a big load of trouble

I dont think they can do that without changing the law  The chip itself
isnt classified and reverse engineering is allowed by law possibly
unless prohibited by a valid contract  The algorithm may be classified
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information but obtained from unclassified sources is freely
publishable with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information
