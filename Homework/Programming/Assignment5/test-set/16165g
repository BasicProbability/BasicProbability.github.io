   encryptions dualedge sword  encryption helps to protect the
   privacy of individuals and industry but it also can shield
   criminals and terrorists  We need the Clipper Chip and other
    
      Just a random passing thought but can anyone cite a documented use
   of encryption technology by criminals and terrorists
      Excluding the IranContra Gang

Sure the rumrunners in Prohibition See Kahns The Codebreakers
The irony was they were using better codes and key security than
most governments were

Yes  great chapter  Elizabeth Friedman sp comes shining through

However the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own
crypto  hired exmilitary folks in fact  Hows that for a revolving
door

Now given that todays rum runners coke runners actually have even more
money than yesterdays its reasonable to expect them to have even better
cryptography  I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet but 

So my question of the FBINISTNSA is How are you going to make the rum
runners use the Clipper Chip

Answer  	youre not

Question	OK  in that case your justification for taking away our
		rights has evaporated  How do you justify our loss of rights
		if you cant use the drug dealers and terrorists
