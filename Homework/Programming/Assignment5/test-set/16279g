 If I want to talk to someone I dont need to have previously exchanged
 keys with him I just call him up and the phones establish a session key
 for us using a zeroknowledge algorithm or something of the kind  If Ive
 misunderstood this part it probably invalidates the rest of this notion
 
 This lends itself to spoofing

 I go buy a pair of Clipper phones to go on a pair of phone lines in a back
 room somewhere and have the digital switch programmed to redirect his
 calls to one of my two lines instead of to his whenever he receives a
 call  The two phones are wired backtoback in the clear


 Anyone see any problem with this scheme other than to assume that all
 public officials and phone company employees are totally incorruptible

As far as I can see no matter how the session keys are generated be it
DiffieHellman or whatever any Cripple conversation which travels in
whole or in part over a landline is vulnerable to this scheme  Law
enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco or illegally by finding
some part of the phone line that they can cut into  The degree of risk
depends very much on location  not good in the middle of a busy street
but not bad on a line in open country leading to a drug lords ranch  The
only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public
key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call all
of them  totally impractical even if some part of the Cripple algorithm
could be used as a kind of public key I dont understand enough about these
things to know

This sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link
and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for
other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone

Gosh yet another way to get round Cripple encryption  How many is that
weve found so far  And thats without even knowing the details of the
algorithm
