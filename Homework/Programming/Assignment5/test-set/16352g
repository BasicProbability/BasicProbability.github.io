You could just as well use a 16 character password to perform the encryption
of the 64 zero bits  One simple method would be to use the first 8 characters
to encrypt the 64 zero bits and then use the remaining 8 characters to
encrypt the result again  The output would still be 64 bits which encodes
into 11 ASCII characters

Wouldnt this method be vulnerable against a birthday attack
Currently a cracker needs to find the only 1 key that produces
the given ciphertext  He has to try about 263 keys on the average
In the proposed method the cracker only needs any pair of key halves
If he can store about 232 guesses for one half he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about 232 guesses  Here I have assumed that the
DESencryption is reversable if the key is guessed  Is this so or do
the modifications of the Sboxes by the salt bits make it nonreversable

1 Probably there is only one key I think there is 1 chance in about 128
that there are two or more keys can anyone verify this but this doesnt
help the cracker much
