 What if clipper is fairly secure but leaves a distinct clipper signature
 that is what if its not too difficult to tell that a msg was clipper
 encrypted even if you cant tell the contents  In that case anyone 
 who is trying to hide behind anther encryption scheme will stand out
 from all of the other traffic and raise a red flag to the NSA etc

I think the obvious answer which may have been posted but I havent
seen it is to encrypt your data with some other scheme then run it
through clipper  The only way the police will be able to detect the
other encryption is through a wiretap so even if they do notice with
an illegal wiretap I have a hard time seeing a judge issuing a
warrant for a search to confiscate the illegal scheme assuming that
at one day it comes to this a worse case based on an illegal
wiretap  Then again maybe I am an idealist
