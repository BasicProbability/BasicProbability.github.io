Subject Advanced one time pad was Re more one time pad stuff


OK if youve read this group for a while you know all about the
onetimepad but heres a question I havent seen

The onetimepad yeilds ideal security but has a wellknown flaw in
authentication  Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad and
exclusiveor as the encryption operation  If an adversary knows the 
plaintext of a message he can change it into any other message  
Heres how it works

Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P under a key stream S
Alice computes the ciphertext C  S xor P  and sends it to Bob

Eve knows the plainext P but wants the message to appear as P
Eve intercepts C and computes  C  C xor P xor P  S xor P
Eve sends C to Bob

Bob decrypts C by computing  Cxor S  P  thus receiving the 
false message which was substituted by Eve


Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information
theoretic security not just computational security
Can we define something like ideal authentication which is the
analog of ideal security  Can we obtain ideal authentication 

If not how much can we limit Eves control over the message 

If we can achieve ideal authentication does the solution use more
key bits or expand the message   Can we show the solution to be
optimal in one or more parameters 

Does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before
