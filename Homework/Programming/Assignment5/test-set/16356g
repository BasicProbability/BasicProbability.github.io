Steve   Hmmm given the error corrections in modern audio CDs is
Steve it sufficient to simply instruct your agent to decrypt using
Steve the bit stream from the second cut of the latest Garth Brooks
Steve CD or are the usual number of bit errors found acceptable in
Steve commercial CDs because of that error correction enough to
Steve garble the message if such a method is used

One unreliable data point while looking over the shoulder of a
recording engineer I decided that he was seeing a raw error rate of
about 1 in 1e6 on a CD master  Both the extrapolation to
massmarket CDs and my state of mind while doing the arithmetic I was
waiting for him to finish so we could go get something to eat are
questionable
