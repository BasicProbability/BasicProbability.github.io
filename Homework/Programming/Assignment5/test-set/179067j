                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
            IN QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WITH THE PRESS 


136 PM EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT  On February the 28th four federal 
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law 
against the Branch Davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled 
weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk  
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective a 51day 
standoff ensued  
	     
	     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every 
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without 
bloodshed and further loss of life  The Bureaus efforts were 
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were 
dealing David Koresh was dangerous irrational and probably 
insane      


The Stacy KoonLawrence Powell defense  The decisions of Janet
Reno and Bill Clinton in this affair are essentially the moral
equivalents of Stacy Koons  Reno and Clinton have the advantage
in that they investigate themselves
