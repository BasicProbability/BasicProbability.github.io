Homosexuals lie about the 10 number to hide the disproportionate
involvement of homosexuals in child molestation  They also lie
about 10 to keep politicians scared

1 You havent shown any disproportionate involvement

2 The Janus Report which came out recently gives 9 as the percentage
of exclusively or predominantly gay men

  I thumbed through the Janus Report in a bookstore recently looking
  for a clue about their methodology   They were very unclear about
  it but as far as I could tell they relied on their professional
  associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects
  interviews and numbers    If so this would hardly represent an
  average crosssection    I posted to Usenet at the time asking for
  more data about their methodology but answer came there none  I
  must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information
  on Usenet


3 No one is presumably going to say theyre gay if theyre not But
some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys Thus
the 12 is a lower limit

  This is the problem  People have to have a lot of confidence in 
  the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak 
  freely about stuff like that    But I agree that if someones 
  going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming
  to be straight rather than the other way around


I still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage
between 5 and 7

  I dont see why theres any more evidence for this figure than any
  other    It seems totally arbitrary
