Subject Re Waco and Panama

In article 1993Apr21224506922acsokstateedu kennejsacsokstateedu KENNEDY JAMES SCOT writes
I completely agree with you  The illegal invasion of Panama was
something Mr Bush never did have to answer for  Remember not
only did a lot of Panamanian civilians get killed but more than
a few American soldiers died too  All this for arresting a petty
dictator  Heres the icing on the cake  to my knowledge the flow
of drugs from Panama hasnt slowed down at all with the removal of
Noriega  So what good did it do to remove him from power  The
cigarette cops and the FBI killing the Branch Davidians in Waco is
equally reprehensible

BTW Ive crossposted this article to tpd because I want to
hear from knowledgable people on whether or not the arrest of
Noriega affected the drug trade in any way

The arrest of Noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the
drug trade going through Panama Money laundering continues to be
Panamas main industry In fact it is bigger now than before Noriega
was arrested 1 Panamas current administration also has ties with
the Colombian cocaine cartels 2 And large amounts cocaine still
flow through Panama on a regular basis 3

Oh well
