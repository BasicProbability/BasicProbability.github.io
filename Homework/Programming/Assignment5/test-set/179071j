Ive come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about
our system  If much or some of it were true youd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it  And given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory
governments federally and provincially and the socialists are still
chafing they wouldve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things  think about it  After all we are using the US as a
metric to make comparison  both for keepingupwiththeJoneses
as for confirming that we did something right

True but remember that most of the Canadianbashing exists because American
proponents of your system make it look like it walks on water Even you dont
go that far

Sorry but Id have to differ  The Canadianbashing wrt to the health 
insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting  Having
kept up with this debate on the net for some months just about all the
criticism of the Canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even
the antiCanadian propaganda put out by the American insurance industry
and the AMA  

In a few cases such as Mr Case the critiques are wellreasoned and
worthy of response  Most others are misinformed illogical
or just plain dumb  I dont think the same can be said of the American
proponents of the Canadian system much less of the Canadian proponents
