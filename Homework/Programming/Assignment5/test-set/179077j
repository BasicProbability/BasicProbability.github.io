	A judge denied GMs new trial motion even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the
impact not from the fire

	Thoughts

	Its kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear

Theres this minor thing called interest of finalityrepose  What
it means is that parties arent dragged into court over and over again
because the losing side discovers some new evidence  I dont know
about you Brett but I suspect GM had the resources to find just
about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial
started  Letting them reopen the case now is practically an
invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole
in case the verdict goes against him

BTW in federal criminal cases Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new
trial based on    newly discovered evidence if made within 2
years of the verdict  Emphasis mine  If youre trying to make a
backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has
little to do with criminal trials  as the estimable David Brock did
in his amusing WSJ piece last week  save your breath



	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be 
believed 
Shouldnt that be up to a jury

Yup  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time
through 


	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM  Shouldnt that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial
	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective

Unless theres some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated
the trial as opposed to being a product of it and that GM was
unfairly prevented from discovering it by venireman concealment or
otherwise why should GM be allowed to complain
