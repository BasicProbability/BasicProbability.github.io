Theres a guy on death row in Texas that was denied a new trial dispite
evidence of his inocents

I recommend the book Adams v Texas the story of a man Adams who
was sentenced to death for a crime he didnt commit  Most of the book
is the story of the long appeals process and the problems and delays
caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts
