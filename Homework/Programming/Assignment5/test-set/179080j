 I recommend the book Adams v Texas the story of a man Adams who
 was sentenced to death for a crime he didnt commit  Most of the book
 is the story of the long appeals process and the problems and delays
 caused by not being able to introduce new evidence in certain courts

And I recommend the movie The Thin Blue Line which is about the
same case  Not as much legal detail but still an excellent film  It
shows how very easy it is to come up with seemingly conclusive
evidence against someone whom you think is guilty
