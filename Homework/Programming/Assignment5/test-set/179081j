	If you look through this newsgroup you should be 
	able to find Clintons proposed Wiretapping Initiative
	for our computer networks and telephone systems
 
	This initiative has been up before Congress for at least
	the past 6 months in the guise of the FBI Wiretapping
	bill

I guess your strength isnt in math Clinton hasnt been president for
6 months In other words its BUSHS Wiretapping Initiative
 
	I strongly urge you to begin considering your future
	I strongly urge you to get your application for a passport
	in the mail soon
 
	I strongly urge you to consider moving any savings you 
	have overseas into protected bank accounts while 
	you are still able
 
Have you
