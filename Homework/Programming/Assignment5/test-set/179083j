	     THE PRESIDENT  Good afternoon  Please be seated  I 
want to say first how delighted I am to be here with Secretary 
Riley and with Senator Graham  The three of us served as governors 
together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to 
improve our schools when we led often difficult and long efforts to 
upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the 
quality of instruction our children were receiving  
	     
	     There were no two governors whom I admired more during 
that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher 
of the Year  And I think both of them would join me in saying that 
after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been 
passed and the funds have been raised and allocated it all comes 
down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the 
classroom
	     
	     Thats why todays ceremony honoring the National 
Teacher of the Year is so important  Tracey Leon Bailey is one 
recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative 
science programs  Hes developed and introduced into Floridas 
classrooms cuttingedge programs in molecular biology and DNA 
fingerprinting  subjects usually taught only in college and I 
might add probably only dimly understood here in the Nations 
Capital  Laughter
	     
	     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high 
school Mr Baileys institution had one of the strongest science 
programs in the entire state of Florida and it won numerous national 
and international awards  These advanced programs arent just for a 
favored few  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students 
including those previously known as lowachieving or atrisk to reach 
for excellence and to attain it  This is what our students need and 
what our country needs 
	     
	     Today we know that a good future with high wages and 
rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a 
lifetime  The basics arent enough anymore  All our kids need 
competence in math and science and advanced problemsolving  Thats 
why Tracey Baileys accomplishments are so important and why I am so 
pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these 
accomplishments 
	     
	     Tracey you represent the best in the United States  
Im glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this 
Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993  Applause  
	     
	     MR BAILEY  Thank you Mr President  It is indeed a 
great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nations 
25 million teachers  And we appreciate the support that you have 
shown for education and were looking forward to working with you to 
help redesign and improve our nations schools  
	     
	     We know that the quality of our childrens education 
will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape 
in the years to come  And we thank you so much for your continued 
support and commitment to our childrens education  Thank you again  
Applause

	     THE PRESIDENT  In closing I would like to also welcome 
the education leaders in Florida who are here those representing the 
national education groups who have also come  Id like to recognize 
Traceys congressman Representative Jim Bacchus in the back himself 
a great advocate of education  And Id like to remind all of you 
that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award 
is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to 
people all across this country who give their lives to our children 
all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their 
best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of 
America  They are in so many ways our most important public 
servants
	     
	     Thank you very much  Applause
