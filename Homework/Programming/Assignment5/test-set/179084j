Subject WACO burning



It is interesting sometimes to listen to US news as seen through
the eyes of another country

BBC world news service on shortwave originating out of London
reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank when
making a hole in the wall of the building knocked over a kerosene
lamp and that is how the fire started  Attempts were made by the
people inside to put out the fire but it spread too quickly

Has anyone in US heard anything similar or are US government
spindoctors censoring such information

The BBC news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died
were british citizens
