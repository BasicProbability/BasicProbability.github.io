Subject Re Waco is Govt fault Was Re Libertarian Party on CIAFBIATF

In article C5wKyG3Fydscomsadesyde hallamdscomsadesyde Phill HallamBaker writes

 1  They raided an Americans property because of rumors about
     Koreshs intentions with some converted yet still 2ndamendment
     protected firearms a judgeapproved warrant justifies nothing

 In a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a 
 search

And this search procedure must also follow the rule of law

 The US constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to 
 mount a search for illegally held weapons

It may if necessary when the search is executed in an illegal and
violent fashion

 The Govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases Attempts to 
 capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others
 is one 

These criminals were threatening the lives of NO ONE  they were fired 
on FIRST according to a number of accounts

 In this case they used sub lethal force 

Wrong  Firing a gun at someone is lethal force even if no one is hit
Of course they DID hit AND kill people

 The children were held hostage The adults were wanted variously for murder
 and conspiracy to murder

You are silly  There are no such warrants in existence Phill

 4  It took hundreds of govt agents with taxfunded cellular phones
     ten minutes to dial 911 for the fire department

 They should not have called the fire dept at all There was no role
 for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might
 well shoot at them Calling the fire dept meant that WACO was deprived
 of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation 
 where it could have been used arisen

Thanks Phill for another example of that great socialist sensitivity
Obey the government or die
