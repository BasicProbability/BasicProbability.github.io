 	I cant wait for the investigation  Considering that everyone
 is dead now and the place is burnt to the ground I guess honest citizens
 will just have to take the word of the ATF about how much of a threat
 these people were

 	Just look at the history of Koresh and his folowers They captured
 	the Mount Carmel complex a few yearss ago in a gun battle with a
 	rival BD sect leaving more than one person dead They werent 
 	exactly the most peace loving bunch

Koresh  some of his followers were tried and found innocent of
all charges following that shootout  Were you unaware of this or
did you purposly leave out this fact

	The fact is that Koresh and his followers involved themselves
	in a gun battle to control the Mt Carmel complex That is not
	in dispute From what I remember of the trial the authories
	couldnt reasonably establish who fired first the big reason
	behind the aquittal
