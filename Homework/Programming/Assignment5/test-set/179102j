Yes weve heard that the survivors are now saying that Weve also
seen the videotape which shows that the fire started in two or
three different places which werent near the tank

    I have not seen the tape on CNN  Which network did you see it on

I saw the film on CNN as it happend It was clear from that tape that
the fire started in ONE location Right where the tank was attacking
and then had pulled back 

No this is not true the CNN pictures show two sites clearly and a third is
barely distinguished 

If you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end
of the building a big one and a little one What appears to be merely a 
long shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little
tower You can tell beacuse the flag in the foreground switches sides from the
right of the picture to the left

The third site is visible as the flames clearly come from a point obscured by
the small tower You need a tape and a good slow motion video to see this
