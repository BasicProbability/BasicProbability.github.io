What exactly are you trying to say  And why were there no fireengines within
a mile of the compound
 
Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters


  What crap Phil 50mm Wrong To give you a clue as to how big 50mm is the
 F16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other 
 aircraft A 50mm gun would be somewhere in the cannon realm They might
 have had 50 calibre but definitely not 50mm 



I think that Phil needs to get out a ruler and see exactly how big 50mm rounds
are  roughly 2 diameter  The type of stuff used in AntiAircraft gunnery
50 calibre is much smaller but the 3000m effective range 2mi sounds about
right Maybe he just got the two confused The FBIs reasoning was sound
but the note from PHB was factually wrong
