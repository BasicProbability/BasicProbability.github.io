Can people please stop the I thinkknow the BATFFBI are completely
responsible but theyll cover it up so that the investigation will
show that Koresch is responsible bs In an investigation of this
size with the feds state and civilians involved in the
investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up

	The place has burned to the ground  The FBI and company
have the whole area cordoned off and have already arrested 
reporters for being at the site and taking pictures

	All your going to get in terms of a story is what the FBI ATF
and the Texas Rangers decide to release  



And with Republicans like Arlen Spector calling for investigations
this isnt going to be handled with kid gloves
 
	When the Philadephia cops dropped their bomb on MOVE and
managed to burn down an entire neighborhood many people said 
the same thing  Dead men and rubble tell no tales that the
police dont want them to tell  

	You can judge the real political mood on this from the
fact that Congressperson Pat Scroder is a 100 supporter of
the FBIs actions  She was on television this week saying that
the cost of the operation in Waco was a valid reason for the
storming and gassing of the compound
