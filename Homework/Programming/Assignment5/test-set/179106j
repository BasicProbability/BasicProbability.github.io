Subject The Government Is LYING


Yesterday the FBI was saying that at least three of the bodies had
gunshot wounds indicating that they were shot trying to escape the
fire  Todays paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there
is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies

At the beginning of this siege it was reported that while Koresh
had a class III machine gun license todays paper quotes the
government as saying no they didnt have a license

Todays paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with
shoulder weapons next to them as if they had been using them while
dying  which doesnt sound like the sort of action I would expect
from a suicide

Our government lies as it tries to cover over its incompetence
and negligence  Why should I believe the FBIs claims about
anything else when we can see that they are LYING

This system of government is beyond reform
