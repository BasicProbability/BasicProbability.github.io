  Ahh whats good for the goose is not necessarily whats good for
  the gander  You dont want homosexuals to impose their moral codes
  such diabolical ideas as equal rights on you yet you are willing
  to impose your moral codes on them  Do I detect a double standard
  
  garison
 
 What do you mean  If adults want to get together for sodomy in
 private thats their business
 
 And thats precisely what they do  So whats your problem with the queer
 population boyo  The only difference between us is what we do in
 privatewho we love

Do it in private and it wont be a problem  But the reason that
the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is
that they want

1 To be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work and
not have people get disgusted

2 To be able to wear their NAMBLA Tshirt and not worry about
getting fired

3 To be able to have access to young boys so that they start
making the next generation of homosexuals

If your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional
a position that I agree with then keep it private and there
wont be a problem
