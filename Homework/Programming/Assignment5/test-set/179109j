   Can someone tell me why when Mr Cramer spouts on about homosexuals
   he only addresses homosexual men and never in any post Ive read
   addressed lesbians
 
  I cant really speak for Mr Cramer here but I can say that a
  homosexual male is an entirely different animal than a lesbian
  There is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the
  aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants
 
 The last time I checked homosexual men and women were both human

I think Mr Kaldis was using the expression in the slang sense
though I agree it is NOT an appropriate expression to use in this
context

 They both prefer to engage in sexual acts with people of the same
 gender  There is nothing inherently wrong with the trademark behaviour
 of either homosexual men or homosexual women except in the minds of
 misinformed folk clueless folk and bigots
 
 So what makes homosexual men and homosexual women different animals
 
 Michael D Adams          starowla2irahulnet          Enterprise Alabama

1 That homosexual men are extremely promiscuous and homosexual women
are if any more promiscuous than heterosexual women its not by
much

2 That homosexual men are overrepresented among child molesters 
about 30 of child molestation is done by homosexual or bisexual
men while homosexual women dont appear to be similarly over
represented
