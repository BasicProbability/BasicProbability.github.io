  Can someone tell me why when Mr Cramer spouts on about homosexuals
  he only addresses homosexual men and never in any post Ive read
  addressed lesbians
 
 I cant really speak for Mr Cramer here but I can say that a
 homosexual male is an entirely different animal than a lesbian
 There is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the
 aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants
 
 So it has nothing to do with your morals its just that you wouldnt
 have anything to wack off to if you didnt have tapes of Lesbians
 going at it
 
 I think we are getting closer to the truth now

No we are getting at Mr Foards sickness  This may surprise
homosexuals but lots of people in this country do NOT spend their
time watching pornography and masturbating  Some of us have 
real lives instead of sexual compulsions  But I dont expect
a homosexual to understand that
 
Clayton E Cramer uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer  My opinions all mine
Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all
