   Can someone tell me why when Mr Cramer spouts on about homosexuals
   he only addresses homosexual men and never in any post Ive read
   addressed lesbians
  
  I cant really speak for Mr Cramer here but I can say that a
  homosexual male is an entirely different animal than a lesbian
  There is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the
  aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants
 
 Obviously  A homosexual male is of the XY chromosome pair and the lesbian
 is of XX  Besides what does that have to do with the price of eggs  Since
 Mr Cramer is very straight he most probably gets off to the thought of
 lesbians like the majority of adolescent males

I hate to disappoint you but thats not the case  I dont get off
on lesbian sex nor am I an adolescent  Now when I was an adolescent
I believed that homosexuals were just like everyone else  But Ive
learned since then
 
Clayton E Cramer uunetpyramidoptilinkcramer  My opinions all mine
Relations between people to be by mutual consent or not at all
