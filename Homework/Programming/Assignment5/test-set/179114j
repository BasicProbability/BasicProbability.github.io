  Sigh  Youre absolutely right  We have no political power whatsoever 
 
 If only that were true  In California homosexuals have enough power
 to impose their morals on others
 
 The only moral were imposing is one which you supposedly embrace already
 every human beings right to be treated as such

I dont expect to be hired based on my sexual orientation  If someone
decides he wants a gayonly staff of employees thats his business
I wont force him to hire heterosexuals please dont force me to
hire homosexuals

  Therefore we should be oppressed and ignored and denigrated right  I
 
 You arent oppressed in California
 
 But its OK to oppress us thats what youre saying

No  Im saying its none of the governments business what two
consenting adults do in private  You dont believe that unfortunately

  certainly hope you dont have an SO sir because if she heard how
  disparaging you are towards political minorities and if she had any shred
  of selfrespect shed be out the door
 
 Why do you keep insulting women and blacks by comparing them to
 homosexuals
 
 This sort of crap makes me so fucking sick that I cant even bring myself to
 touch it  Youre a fuckwit with no perspective no valid life experience
 and no true knowledge of the human condition  I see no point in trying to
 convince you politely that were not all like the ones youve met because
 youre showing no willingness at all to be openminded enough to accept that
 your stupid generalizations have exceptions  You are an intellectual waste
 and the reason you believe the worst of homosexuals is that you bring out
 the worst in them
 
 bi    Andrew D Simchik					SCHNOPIA

And you are yet another reminder of the emotional instability of
homosexuals
