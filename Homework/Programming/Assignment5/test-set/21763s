 Hi Eddie many people believe the battle described in Rev 12712
 describes the casting out of Satan from heaven and his fall to the
 earth
 Shalom                             Len Howard


Also  check out Jude  Plus if you have a concordance handy check
out all the references to stars  These are generally taken to mean
angels I believe
