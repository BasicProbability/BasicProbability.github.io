Hi Eddie many people believe the battle described in Rev 12712
describes the casting out of Satan from heaven and his fall to the
earth
Shalom                             Len Howard

Luke 101618

He that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth
 me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me

And the seventy returned again with joy saying Lord even the
 devils are subject unto us through thy name

And he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven
 
If a prayer today is spoken please offer it up for me
When the bridge to heaven is broken and youre lost on the wild wild seas
Lost on the wild wild sea
