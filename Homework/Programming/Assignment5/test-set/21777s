                    THIS WEEKS THOUGHTS 

Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by Rensselaer IN school officials desiring the
distribution of Bibles in their public schools REL65 521 A
lower court had banned the local Gideons an international Bible
distribution group from passing out Bibles to fifthgraders The
ACLUs Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the courts action
protected the religious neutrality of our public schools He also
said that schools must serve students of all faiths and none
Schools were not to be a bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts according to Lynn

Several Gideons men who are responsible for putting Bibles in
hospitals and hotels are members of our church They tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on
sidewalks around the schools but cannot go inside the schools
They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a Bible from a stranger They are willing to
continue their work at a distance but find the schools position
somewhat disheartening

I understand rationally and logically the courts position And I
can see the sense of fairness for all groups But on the other
hand when does neutrality become nihilism When does plurality
turn into no position at all

I see a couple of ironies here One is that we can pass out condoms
but not Bibles in our schools Think on that one for a moment

The other is that while we are seeking religious neutrality in
our schools countries like Russiawho by the way practiced
religious neutrality for the past seventy yearsare making the 
Bible part of their public school curriculum When I was in St
Petersburg in March the church we worked with had trained over 100
public school teachers to teach the Bible and the government had
requested hundreds more I recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents I
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
Lenin Now thats ironic

I admit two things 1 We are a pluralistic society and all faiths
have equal footing This is what our country was founded on 2 To
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaarlike
atmosphere Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them 3I know I said twoThe vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid

Howeverand you knew this was comingI believe disallowing the
distribution of the Bible by lawabiding caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our cultures movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions

What do you think

Good column re TIME coverstory about teen sexuality I agree
with moral education from home but some homes dont have the kinds
of morals I want taught  One family I worked with smoked dope as
their primary family activity  Another acted like incest was OK
Families no matter where they are are often a lot sicker than
wed like to believe

From John Hightower MC 407602

John

I agree that the home aint what it used to be and some homes
are NOT the place to learn valuebased sexuality I still believe
that this is where the church can come into play I know those
families you speak of may not come to a church to seek information
but the help does not need to be in a church buildingI believe
that the youth from the families you mentioned will probably
disregard the valuefree information at school too
