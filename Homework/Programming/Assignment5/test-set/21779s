Subject Re St Maria Goretti

After reading this story about St Maria Goretti posted two weeks
ago I am a bit confused  While it is clear that her daily
life is one of probity and sanctity I am afraid I dont quite
understand the final episode of her life  I am reading it 
correctly she and the Church apparently felt that being raped
was a sin on her part one so perfidious that she would rather
die than commit it  If this is the case Im afraid that I 
disagree rather strongly

Can anyone out there explain this one to me

Yours in Christ
