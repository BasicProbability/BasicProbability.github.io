     I have a question about Satan  I was taught a long time ago
that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
because he challenged Gods authority  The problem is I cannot
find this in the Bible  Is it in the Bible  If not where did it
originate
 
ref to Rev 12712 deleted

Also read Ezek 281319  This is a desctiption of Lucifer later Satan
and how beautiful He was etc etc
