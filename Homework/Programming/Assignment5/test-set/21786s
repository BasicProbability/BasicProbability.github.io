THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING
OF ARSENOKOITAI WITH IMPLICATIONS
FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY

                                      James B DeYoung

W Petersen

     More recently Wrights understanding has itself been questioned from a
different direction  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic
confusion in using the English word homosexuals as the meaning of
arsenokoitai22   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for
rendering it by homosexuals in I Cor 69 and I Tim 110

     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey Boswell and Scroggs into a
single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of Bailey  He finds
homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic  A
major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the
thought and terminolgy in Pauls time 18788

      What is this disjunction  He bases it on historical and linguistic
facts  Accordingly ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as
polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts 
Virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable 
Christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in
describing these actions  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of
homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of Dover
quoted approvingly by Petersen everyone responds at different times to both
homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli   188 23

      In contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual
to desire and propensity  KM Benkert who in 1869 coined the German term
equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or
affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts 189

     Petersen then proceeds to cite the Supplement to the Oxford English
Dictionary  which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no
mention of acts  Petersens point is that by using homosexuals for
arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history
where no equivalent concept existed 189  Consequently the translation is
inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles    incorrectly exludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts    andincorrectly includes
female homosexuals 1989  Prior to 1869 there was no cognitive structure
either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of
humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence 189

     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio
homosexual is mistaken  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one
mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds  The next
phases of this paper will critically examine Petersens position

                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING
                          ARSENOKOITAI BY HOMOSEXUALS

Historical Grounds

     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai
by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence  Since
virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Pauls
usage no historical settings earlier than his are available  Yet much writing
reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary
with Paul  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of
homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to
presentday concepts  

     Peterson Bailey Boswell and Scroggs claim that the homosexual
condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be
part of the definition of the term  They assert this either because the term
is limited to acts of particular kind Boswell active male prostitutes 
Scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient
times Bailey Petersen  The following discussion will show why neither of
these positions is legitimate  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion
first with the former one being addressed below under Linguistic Grounds

     In regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the
homosexual condition exist before 1869  Is it only a modern phenomenon Yet if
it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including
ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it 
Indeed evidence show that the ancients preChristian and Christian not only
knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of
samesex activity transvestism included but also knoew about samesex
orientation or condition  Petersen admits 190 n 10 that Plato in
Symposium 189d192d may be a sole possible exception to ancient
ingnorance of this condition  He discounts this however believing that even
here acts appear to be the deciding factor  However this is a very
significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of
the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition

     THe Symposium of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for
knowledge about the homosexual condition 24   Plato posits a third sex
comprised of a mailefemale androgynon manwoman Hence original nature
palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings  Zeus sliced these
human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the
gods  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the
opposite sex or one of the same sex  Plato then quotes Aristophances

    Each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like
    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two  and each is ever
    searching for the tally that will fit him  All the men who are sections
    of that composite sex that at first was called manwoman are 
    womancourters  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex
    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses
    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men
    they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the sheminions
    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as 
    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by
    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be
    clasped in mens embrasces  these are the finest boys and striplings
    for they have the most manly nature  Some say they are shameless
    creatures but falsely  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness
    but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome
    their like  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity
    these alone prove in a public career to be men  So when they come
    to mans estate they are boylovers and have no natural interest in
    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of
    custom  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days
    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the 
    willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind  Well when
    one of them whether he be a boylover or a lover of any other sort 
    happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously 
    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be 
    induced to leave each others side for a single moment  These are
    they who continue together throughout life though they could not
    even say what they would have of one another 191d192c 25

Should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as
long as they live or even in Hades Aristophanes says that each would
unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all
the time  192e

     Several observations about this text are in order  Lesbianism is
contemplated as will as male homosexuality 191e  Natural interest ton
noun physei 192b refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination 
The words born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man 
paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai 192b reflect the modern claims to
be born this ie as homosexual  The idea of mutuallity the two of them
are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love 192b is
present  Aristophanes even speaks of mutual love ingrained in mankind
reassembling our early estate ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai
tes archaias physeos synagogeus 191d The concept of permanency These are
they who continue together throughout life 102c is also present  Further
mention of andor allusion to permanecy mutality gay pride pederasty
homophobia motive desire passion and the nature of love and its works is
recognizable

    Clearly the ancients thought of love homosexual or other apart from
actions  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is
crucial  money office influence etc   bring reproach 182e183a 184b 
They mention the need to love the soul not the body 183e  There are tow
kinds of love in the body 186b and each has its desire and passion
186bd  The speakers discuss the principles or matters of love 187c the
desires of love 192c and being males by nature 193c  Noteworthy is the
speech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is
related to love and its objects 200a201c  Desire is felt for what is not
provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack  This is
the object of desire and love  Socrates clearly distinguishes between what
sort of being is love and the works of love 201e  This ancient
philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of
being or nature  His wors have significance for more than pederasty 26

     In summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and
homosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato  Petersen is in error
when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not
inclination or orientation  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the
latter 27

     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where
homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction  In
Rom 12128 such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires
of the heart and reprobate mind prove Pauls concern for disposition and
inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv 2932 
Even the catologues of vices are introdiced I Tim 1810 or concluded I Cor
6911 by words describing what people are or were not what they do 
Habits betray what people are within as also the Lord Jesus taught cf Matt
2328  The inner condition is as important as the outer act one gives rise
to the other cf Mt 527

     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too  Transvestism apparently
was accepted by the ancients   It was practiced among Canaaniteds Syrian
people of Asia Minor as well as Greeks according to SR Driver 28  Only a
few moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it  For example
Seneca Moral Epistles 4778 condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an
adult slave to dress be beardless and behave as a woman  Philo also goes to
some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women
The Special Laws III 3741  see also his On the Virtues 2021 where he
justifies prohibition of crossdressing  Even the OT forbade the interchange
of clothing between the sexes  Deut 225

     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the
new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior  These did not
begin with Paul Rom 12627 but go as far back as ancient Greece and even
nonChristian contemporaries used them  Plato the TESTNAPH Philo Josephu
Plutarch and others used these words or related concepts 29

Harvard Univ 1967 141143  Note the reference to adulteress  If there is
a homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes logically there must
also be an adulterous conditon derived from birth
26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love
the male and young men 181c but this must not be love for boys too young 
the latter should be outlawed 181de  Such love of youths is to be permanent
181d lifelong and abiding 184a  Where homosexual love is considered a
disgrace such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the
cowardice of the ruled 182d an early charge of homophobia  In Athens it
was more honorable to love openly than in secret 182d an ancient expression
of coming out of the closet  Mutality was present this compels lover and
beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue 184b
    For Petersen to label the Symposium a possible exception to his position
is inadequate and misrepresentative  It is a significant witness to Greek
society hundreds of years before the time of Christ
