Subject Re The doctrine of Original Sin

Alan  E Alan Idler aidlersoluvicca writes

Alan 2  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing Marvel
Alan not that I said unto thee Ye must be born again John 37
Alan Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks to Nicodemus  a
Alan ruler of the Jews not a child

Yes but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement
in the same conversation

Flesh gives birth to flesh but the Spirit gives birth to spirit
John 36

Clearly infants are not born of the spirit  Thus without baptism
they are unspiritual  They are not born with the image of God but in
Adams fallen image cf Gen 53  They have no righteousness of
their own just as adults have no righteousness of their own  There
is only the imputed righteousness of Christ which believers receive
through faith

Alan 3  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the
Alan concept of spiritual rebirth through baptism if newborn babies
Alan werent free from sin

Your point is a little obscure here but I think you are saying
that Christ used the innocence of newborn babes as a metaphor
for spiritual rebirth  But this is not what he did
If you look at the text he did not speak
of spiritual rebirth but of spiritual birth  We are
born of the Spirit once not twice or several times
We are also born of the flesh once  The Lord makes it
clear that these are separate and different events
It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual
birth as rebirth because it is a second birth
for example Titus 35  But it is not a second
spiritual birth

The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth
which is used as a symbol of new life  not of innocence  When an
infant is born or conceived a new life is begunbut it is neither
innocent nor righteous  Similarly when that same individual is
baptized or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism they begin a
new life in Christ Romans 63 Colossians 212 Titus 35 Ephesians
25  Then the believer has Gods assurance of the forgiveness of
their sins and of Christs imputed righteousness
