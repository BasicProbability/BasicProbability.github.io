 Technically the messengers arent even human so
 it cant be a case of homosexuality  even of rape 

 The Jude reference to Sodom is also meaningful only in the context of
 the Sodomites lust for the other flesh of angels  Again
 application to homosexual behavior in general or to the position of
 gay Christians is largeely specious
 
 Are angels flesh No I feel that this is saying that it was because
 of their lust after other men who are flesh or of this world

 what are other opinons on this I havent heard much about this verse  
 at all

Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on James Peter and Jude points
out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing
the elect from apostates not just the wicked in general  Hence those
who were delivered from Egypt but did not follow Moses and by extension
God the apostate angels and Sodom and Gomorrah  Quoting Reike

	Fornication may here as often in the New Testament
	refer to idolatry while flesh as in I Pet 124 
	denotes human society and its violent attempts at self
	exaltation  Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders
	of apostasy and the surrounding cities correspond to
	their followers p 199


There is no inherent reason to read this verse 7 as literally referring
to actual sexual lust for alien flesh  Nor is it inherently necessary
to understand it as referring to homosexuality outside of the circular
reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin
of homosexuality  The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified and
not merely inferred is in Ezekiel 1649 This was the guilt of your sister
Sodom she and her daughters had pride excess of food and prosperous ease
bit did not aid the poor and needy  They were haughty and did abominable
things before me therefore I removed them when I saw it

For the same reason overliteralizing the text your correspondents
suggestion that the reason the passage doesnt deal with homosexuality
is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly  There 
are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the
Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se
