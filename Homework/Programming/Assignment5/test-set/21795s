From atterlepvelaacsoaklandedu Cardinal Ximenez
Subject Dialogue with conservatives wanted


  Are there any members of conservative religious politically active groups
such as the Christian Coalition out there  I come from a very liberal 
background and Id like to talk to some conservative people out there in a 
public forum such as this one  I frankly cant understand the rationale or
Christian basis for much of the conservative position and Id like to try and
learn more about this movementafter all were part of the same church  Is
anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint
  Thanks
