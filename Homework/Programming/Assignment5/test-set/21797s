  Hate the sin but love the sinner  My question is whether that
  statement is consistent with Christianity I would think not
 
 Im very grateful for scotts reflections on this oftquoted phrase  Could
 someone please remind me of the Scriptural source for it 

Its not scriptural but comes from the patristic age I think
something about amare errantem interficere errorem which sounds
more like love the errant slay the error  No doubt someone else 
will know in particular who minted the phrase  If I had to guess Id
blame   St Augustine who seems to have had a gift for aphorism

Sometimes its necessary to act as if you believed
