 AJW Does anyone know of an English language edition that does not show the
 AJW verse or even chapter numbers



 clh The original NEB put verse numbers only in the margin   

Kenneth Wuests expanded translation of the New Testament does the same  it puts the range of verse numbers next to the top of each paragraph Being an expanded translation it is quite verbose though  more suitable for detailed study than for quick reading
