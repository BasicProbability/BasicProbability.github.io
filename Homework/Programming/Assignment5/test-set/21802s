 in response to a question about why Jesus parents would be sanctified 
beyond normal humanity

When Elizabeth greeted Mary Elizabeth said something to the effect that
Mary out of all women was blessed  If so it appears that this
exactly places Mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity

I would think that simply being pregnant with the incarnation of the 
Almighty God would be enough to make Mary blessed among all women whether
or not she had special spiritual attributes  I find that the more special
Mary needs to be the less human Jesus gets
