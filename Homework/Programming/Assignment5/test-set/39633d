Subject HELP A rectangle and parallelogram

I hope someone can help me with the following problem  Im sure there
must be a known solution

Given a rectangle defined by

X  x  X  and Y  y  Y  where X and Y are constant

and a parallelogram defined by

C1  ax  by  C1  and C2  cx  dy  C2

where C1 C2 a b c d are constants and ba  dc ie not
parallel lines                                
                                          not equal to

what is the area of their intersection

   What Im after is some general algorithm suitable for ALL rectangles
and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations  At the 
moment it looks like Im going to have to look at all possible cases 
and examine each seperately eg

1 rectangle encloses parallelogram 

2 parallelogram encloses rectangle

3 two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle

                          
                          
                           
                            
           Y   Y
                                        
                                        
                                               origin
                                        
                                        
          Y  Y
            X                            X
                              
                             
                             

4 two corners of parallelogram outside rectangle

   I hope someone can help

Many thanks in advance
