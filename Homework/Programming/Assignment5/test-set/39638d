1  What is JPEG

JPEG pronounced jaypeg is a standardized image compression mechanism
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard  JPEG is designed for compressing either
fullcolor or grayscale digital images of natural realworld scenes
It does not work so well on nonrealistic images such as cartoons or line
drawings

JPEG does not handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel images nor does it
handle motion picture compression  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees named JBIG and MPEG
respectively

JPEG is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isnt
quite identical to what you originally put in  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably
the fact that small color details arent perceived as well as small details
of lightanddark  Thus JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans  If you plan to machineanalyze your images the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they are
invisible to the eye

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality  You can make extremely small
files if you dont mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image
archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc  Conversely if you
arent happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression


2  Why use JPEG

There are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store
24bitperpixel color data instead of 8bitperpixel data

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte fullcolor file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time  If you are comparing GIF and JPEG the
size ratio is more like four to one  More details below

If your viewing software doesnt support JPEG directly youll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images  Even
with a JPEGcapable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format GIF for instance  Thus using
JPEG is essentially a timespace tradeoff you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply

Its worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file  Ill let you do the arithmetic yourself

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information 24 bitspixel
16 million colors instead of 8 or less 256 or fewer colors  If you have
only 8bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you  Within a couple of years though 8bit GIF will look as obsolete as
blackandwhite MacPaint format does today  Furthermore for reasons detailed
in section 7 JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard


3  When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF

JPEG is not going to displace GIF entirely for some types of images
GIF is superior in image quality file size or both  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to

As a rule of thumb JPEG is superior to GIF for storing fullcolor or
grayscale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and
similar material  JPEG is superior even if you dont have 24bit display
hardware and it is a LOT superior if you do  See section 7 for details

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors
such as cartoons and line drawings  In particular large areas of pixels
that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF  JPEG cant squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form
In particular singlecolor borders are quite cheap in GIF files but they
should be avoided in JPEG files

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pureblack pixels
adjacent to a row of purewhite pixels for example  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting  Again this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files borders overlaid text etc  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text thats only a few pixels high
If you have a GIF with a lot of smallsize overlaid text dont JPEG it

Computerdrawn images raytraced scenes for instance usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it
The same goes for semirealistic artwork fantasy drawings and such

Plain blackandwhite two level images should never be converted to JPEG
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for grayscale
images  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for grayscale images
of up to 256 levels while JPEG is not

If you have an existing library of GIF images you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG  You will lose a little image quality if you do
Section 7 which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF only
applies if both formats start from a fullcolor original  If you start from
a GIF youve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information JPEG
can only make things worse  However the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway  This is a decision youll have to make for yourself
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section 14 for hints  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format since some GIFs will not
convert well


4  How well does JPEG compress images

Pretty darn well  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy a 727x525 fullcolor image of a ship in a harbor  The first three
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

shipppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format no compression 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead
shipppmZ	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesnt accomplish a lot youll note
			 Other textoriented compressors give similar results
shipgif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant fs 256  ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info GIF saves 8 bitspixel not 24  See sec 7

shipjpg95	 155622  cjpeg Q 95    highest useful quality setting
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24bit original
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs
shipjpg75	  58009  cjpeg Q 75    default setting
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original even with both onscreen at once
shipjpg50	  38406  cjpeg Q 50
			 This has slight defects if you know what to look
			 for you could tell its been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups
shipjpg25	  25192  cjpeg Q 25
			 JPEGs characteristic blockiness becomes apparent
			 at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some
			 Still Ive seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this
shipjpg5o	   6587  cjpeg Q 5 optimize  optimize cuts table overhead
			 Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes  Note that this file is TINY
			 the compression ratio from the original is 1731 

In this case JPEG can make a file thats a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality the Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF better if you have a fullcolor display  This seems to be a typical
ratio for realworld scenes


5  What are good quality settings for JPEG

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings  Quality 95 does NOT mean keep 95 of the
information as some have claimed  The quality scale is purely arbitrary
its not a percentage of anything

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another but here are some rules of thumb

The default quality setting Q 75 is very often the best choice  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image  Try Q 75 first if you see defects then go up  Except for
experimental purposes never go above Q 95 saying Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as Q 95 but of hardly any better quality

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to
go down to Q 50 without objectionable degradation  On the other hand you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG
The default Q 75 is about right for compressing 24bit images but Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs see section 14 for more info

If you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are
prepared to tolerate large defects a Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right  Q 2 or so may be amusing as op art

Note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B and to many programs based on it  Other
JPEG implementations such as Image Alchemy may use a completely different
quality scale  Some programs dont even provide a numeric scale just
highmediumlowstyle choices


6  Where can I get JPEG software

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP
If you dont know how to use FTP see the FAQ article How to find sources
If you dont have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail servers in the
same article  That article appears regularly in newsanswers or you can
get it by sending email to mailserverrtfmmitedu with
send usenetnewsanswersfindingsources in the body  The Anonymous FTP
List FAQ may also be helpful  its usenetnewsanswersftplistfaq in
the newsanswers archive

NOTE this list changes constantly  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old get the latest JPEG FAQ from the newsanswers archive


6A  If you are looking for canned software viewers etc

The first part of this list is systemspecific programs that only run on one
kind of system  If you dont see what you want for your machine check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet but some commercial programs are listed too

X Windows

XV shareware 25 is an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and many other
image formats  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations  Its available for FTP from exportlcsmitedu 1824012
file contribxv300tarZ  Version 300 is a major upgrade with support
for 24bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge stick with version 221 also available from export  Note that
version 221 is not a good choice if you have a 24bit display youll get
only 8bit color nor for converting 24bit images to JPEG  But 221 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8bit images to JPEG  CAUTION there is a
glitch in version 221 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox
when saving a JPEG file or the file will be blurry

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristys free ImageMagick package
also available from exportlcsmitedu file contribImageMagicktarZ
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24bit displays correctly for colormapped
displays it does better though slower color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software

Both of the above are large complex packages  If you just want a simple
image viewer try xloadimage or xli  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release 303  xloadimage is free and available from exportlcsmitedu
file contribxloadimage303tarZ  xli is a variant version of xloadimage
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original
The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG files because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 303 is using a hackedover v1  The next
xloadimage release will fix this  xli is also free and available from
exportlcsmitedu file contribxli114tarZ  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24bit displays


MSDOS

This covers plain DOS for Windows or OS2 programs see the next headings

One good choice is Eric Praetzels free DVPEG which views JPEG and GIF files
The current version 25 is available by FTP from suneeuwaterlooca
129975050 file pubjpegviewersdvpeg25zip  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386486 machines  The user interface is
not flashy but its functional

Another freeware JPEGGIFTGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaeis Hiview  The
current version 12 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE
below file msdosgraphicshv12zip  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPIcompatible memory manager QEMM386 and 386MAX work Windows and
OS2 do not  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen  For larger images it scales the image down to fit
on the screen rather than using panningscrolling as most viewers do
You may or may not prefer this approach but theres no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably  Note installation is a
bit tricky read the directions carefully

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS 30  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives  Its user interface is
also much spiffierlooking although personally I find it harder to use 
more keystrokes inconsistent behavior  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview at least on my hardware  For images larger than
screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both
are faster than Hiview  The current version is 21 available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsdcview21zip
Requires a VESA graphics driver if you dont have one look in vesadrv2zip
or vesatsrzip from the same directory  Many recent PCs have a builtin
VESA driver so dont try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing

A second shareware alternative is Fullview which has been kicking around
the net for a while but I dont know any stable archive location for it
The current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time

The wellknown GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW supports JPEG in its latest
revision 860a  However CSHOWs JPEG implementation isnt very good
its slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is
poor except on hicolor displays  Too bad  itd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW  Shareware 25  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgifcshw860azip

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine  If you cant get any
of them to work youll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer  If you
have hicolor hardware dont use GIF as the intermediate format try to
find a TARGAcapable viewer instead  VPIC50 is reputed to do the right
thing with hicolor displays

The Independent JPEG Groups free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsjpeg4zip or
jpeg4386zip if you have a 386 and extended memory  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF Targa and PPM formats

Handmade Software offers free JPEGGIF conversion tools GIF2JPGJPG2GIF
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format in
particular you cant get 24bit color output from a JPEG  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSIs proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Since HSIformat
files are rather widespread on BBSes this is a useful capability  Version
20 of these tools is free prior versions were shareware  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsgif2jpg2zip
NOTE do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet since it is
not readable on nonPC platforms

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package Image Alchemy  This will translate JPEG files both JFIF and HSI
formats to and from many other image formats  It can also display images
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 162 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites see NOTE below file msdosgraphicsalch162zip

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20 The Internets key archive site for PCrelated programs
is Simtel20 full name wsmrsimtel20armymil 1928811020  Simtel20
runs a nonUnix system with weird directory names where this document
refers to directory eg msdosgraphics at Simtel20 that really means
pd1msdosgraphics  If you are not physically on MILnet you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the Simtel20 archives
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead  A popular USA
mirror site is oakoaklandedu 14121010117 which keeps Simtel20 files
in eg pubmsdosgraphics  If you have no FTP capability you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by email see informational postings in
comparchivesmsdosannounce to find out how  If you are outside the USA
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is

Microsoft Windows

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images
Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware
due to Windows system overhead  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window

The newest entry is WinECJ which is free and EXTREMELY fast  Version 10
is available from ftprahulnet file pubbryanwpcjpegwecjzip
Requires Windows 31 and 256ormorecolors mode  This is a nofrills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers
But its so fast youll use it anyway at least for previewing

JView is freeware fairly fast has good online help and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format but it cant create new JPEG
files and it doesnt view GIFs  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but its
an excellent basic viewer  The current version 09 is available from
ftpcicaindianaedu 129792084 file pubpcwin3desktopjview090zip
Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites
including wuarchivewustledu

WinJPEG shareware 20 displays JPEGGIFTargaTIFF and BMP image files
it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter
It has some other nifty features including colorbalance adjustment and
slideshow  The current version is 21 available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites see NOTE above file msdoswindows3winjp210zip  This is a slow
286compatible version if you register youll get the 386only version
which is roughly 25 faster

ColorView is another shareware entry 30  This was an early and promising
contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG  If you want to try it anyway the
current version is 097 available from ftpcicaindianaedu file
pubpcwin3desktopcview097zip  I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS

DVPEG see DOS heading also works under Windows but only in fullscreen
mode not in a window

OS2

The following files are available from hobbesnmsuedu 12812335151
Note check pubuploads for more recent versions  the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories
pubos22xgraphicsjpegv4zip

Macintosh

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apples JPEG implementation which is part of
the QuickTime system extension so you need to have QuickTime installed
To use QuickTime you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 607 or later  If youre running System 6 you must also install
the 32bit QuickDraw extension this is builtin on System 7  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimequicktimehqx
As of 1192 this file contains QuickTime 15 which is better than QT 10
in several ways  With respect to JPEG it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file  However
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 15

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTimes JPEG format PICTJPEG is
not the same as the Usenetstandard JFIF JPEG format  See section 10 for
details  If you post images on Usenet make sure they are in JFIF format
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format

The first choice is probably JPEGView a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format PICTJPEG format or GIF format  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats  The current version 20 is a big
improvement over prior versions  Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu
364406 file infomacappjpegview20hqx  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime  On 8bit displays JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers in fact its
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac  Given a large image JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers  You can zoom in on any desired portion though  Some people
like this behavior some dont  Overall JPEGViews user interface is very
well thought out

GIFConverter a shareware 40 image viewerconverter supports JFIF and
PICTJPEG as well as GIF and several other image formats  The latest
version is 232  Get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacartgifgifconverter232hqx  Requires System 605 or later
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEGGIF viewer but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images  Also the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images without QuickTime so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime  But its faster with QuickTime
Note If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then viewing the GIF version

JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities is
available from sumexaimstanfordedu file infomacappjpegconvert10hqx
This will run on any Mac but it only does file conversion not viewing
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v06 a JPEGGIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code  If you are using this
program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert

Apples free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and
GIF format and can convert between these formats  You can get PictPixie
from ftpapplecom file dtsmacquicktimeqt10stuffpictpixiehqx
Requires QuickTime  PictPixie was intended as a developers tool and its
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24bit display
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface  Worse PictPixie is an
unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix  There is an old version of PictPixie called
PICTCompressor floating around the net  If you have this you should trash
it as its even buggier  Also the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleanedup descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net

Storm Technologys Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewerconverter
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime so you may be forced to use it on
older systems  It does need 32bit QuickDraw so really old machines cant
use it  You can get it from sumexaimstanfordedu file
infomacapppicturedecompress201hqx  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to JPEG to allow Picture Decompress to open it

If your machine is too old to run 32bit QuickDraw a Mac Plus for instance
GIFConverter is your only choice for singleprogram JPEG viewing  If you
dont want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG although not
all can deal with the Usenetstandard JFIF format  Adobe Photoshop version
201 or later can read and write JFIFformat JPEG files use the JPEG
plugin from the Acquire menu  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to JPEG to allow Photoshop to recognize it

Amiga

Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amigaphysikunizhch 130608080  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one  In the USA a good
choice is wuarchivewustledu look under mirrorsamigaphysikunizhch

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewerconverter as well as being a
general image manipulation tool  Its cheap shareware 20 and can read
several formats besides JPEG  The current version is 208  A demo version
is available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxedithamlab208dlha  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512 but it is otherwise fully functional

Rend24 shareware 30 is an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM
and GIF images  The program can be used to create animations even
capturing frames onthefly from rendering packages like Lightwave  The
current version is 105 available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror
sites file amigaos30gfxrend105lha  Note although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 30 programs the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 13 204 or 21

Viewtek is a free JPEGILBMGIFANIM viewer  The current version is 104
available from amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites file
amigagfxshowViewTek104lha

If youre willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend24
and Viewtek  These are CineMorph a standalone image morphing package and
ImageFX an impressive 24bit image capture conversion editing painting
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products  Art Department Professional ADPro
from ASDG Inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas  ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems is another
wellregarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amigaphysikunizhch and mirror sites in directory amigagfxconv file
AmigaJPEGV4lha  These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPMGIFTarga formats

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quickanddirty JPEG programs many
based on an ancient betatest version of the free IJG JPEG software thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its diskofthemonth without
so much as notifying the authors  Among these are AugJPEG NewAmyJPEG
VJPEG and probably others I have not even heard of  In my opinion
anything older than IJG version 3 March 1992 is not worth the disk space
its stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer

Atari ST

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST TT etc
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsjpeg4binzoo
These programs convert JPEG tofrom PPM GIF Targa formats

For monochrome ST monitors try MGIF which manages to achieve fourlevel
grayscale effect by flickering  Version 41 reads JPEG files  Available
from atariarchiveumichedu file atariGraphicsmgif41bzoo

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEGcapable viewers for
Ataris but surely there must be some by now  Pointers appreciated

Acorn Archimedes

ChangeFSI supplied with RISC OS 3 version 310 can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by doubleclicking

Recent versions since 711 of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG along with about 30 other image formats  While older versions can be

ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it
ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at
sonataccpurdueedu and csorstedu somewhere in pubnext both are
currently being reorganized so its hard to point to specific
subdirectories  Note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support JPEG


Portable software for almost any system

If none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B  Youll also need a viewer program
If your display is 8 bits or less any GIF viewer will do fine if you have a
display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24bit image files

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings with more popping up every
day  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow  In that case
purchase a hardwareassisted product  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone elses files

7  Whats all this hoopla about color quantization

Most people dont have fullcolor 24 bit per pixel display hardware
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time  To display a fullcolor image the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors  This process is called color quantization  This is something
of a misnomer color selection would be a better term  Were stuck with
the standard usage though

Clearly color quantization is a lossy process  It turns out that for most
images the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings

Since JPEG is a fullcolor format converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8bitorless hardware requires color quantization  This is true for
all color JPEGs even if you feed a 256orlesscolor GIF into JPEG what
comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors but thousands of colors
This happens because JPEGs lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors  Each original color gets smeared
into a group of nearby colors  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image
source  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for grayscale output

Incidentally because of this effect its nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences  I occasionally see
posted images described as 256color JPEG  This tells me that the poster
a hasnt read this FAQ and b probably converted the JPEG from a GIF
JPEGs can be classified as color or grayscale just like photographs but
number of colors just isnt a useful concept for JPEG

On the other hand a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors  A GIF does have a definite number of colors in its
palette and the format doesnt allow more than 256 palette entries
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients dont have to
This is also the disadvantage of GIF youre stuck with the senders
quantization  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display you have to requantize resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a fullcolor image
Furthermore if the sender didnt use a highquality color quantization
algorithm youre out of luck

For this reason JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines dont match the senders display hardware
JPEGs full color image can be quantized to precisely match the users display
hardware  Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in
this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have  With a GIF youre stuck forevermore with what was
sent

Its also worth mentioning that many GIFviewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines  If you view a 256color GIF on a 16color EGA
display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations one to create the GIF one to display it but often its
also due to sloppiness  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed  Thus JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for lowcolorresolution displays as well as highresolution ones

Finally an evergrowing number of people have betterthan8bit display
hardware already 15bit hicolor PC displays true 24bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes etc  For these people GIF is already
obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively
Thus JPEG is an allaround better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machineindependent fashion


8  How does JPEG work

The buzzwords to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine
transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding  This articles long enough already so Im not going to say more
than that here  For technical information see the compcompression FAQ

9  What about lossless JPEG

Theres a great deal of confusion on this subject  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm ie one that guarantees the
final output is bitforbit identical to the original input  However this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG
algorithm and it offers much less compression  At present very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist and all of them are commercial

Saying Q 100 to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step  With the V4 free JPEG code you can also say
sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value its highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image

At this minimumloss setting regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24bitperpixel image  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees
bitforbit accuracy

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel furthermore JPEG is public domain at least with a
Huffman back end while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents


10  Why all the argument about file formats

Strictly speaking JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms
it does not refer to a specific image file format  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations

Since we cant actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format this leaves us with a problem  In the absence of
official standards a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
do their own thing and as a result their programs arent compatible with
anybody elses

The closest thing we have to a defacto standard JPEG format is some work
thats been coordinated by people at CCube Microsystems  They have defined
two JPEGbased file formats
   JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a lowend format that transports
    pixels and not much else
   TIFFJPEG aka TIFF 60 an extension of the Aldus TIFF format  TIFF is
    a highend format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides   TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF  Its not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEGrelated products its reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now the
TIFF 60 spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details  Even when TIFFJPEG is well
defined the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common
denominator TIFFJPEG files may never be as transportable

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apples QuickTime
software for the Macintosh  QuickTime uses a JFIFcompatible format wrapped
inside the Macspecific PICT structure  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward and several Mac programs are
available to do it see Mac portion of section 6A  If you have an editor
that handles binary files you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand see section 11 for details

Another particular case is Handmade Softwares programs GIF2JPGJPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format  By default though they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI  This format is NOT readable by any nonHSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings  Use the j switch to get JFIF output  This
applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit JFIF
format by default  You still should be careful not to post HSIformat
files unless you want to get flamed by people on nonPC platforms


11  How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wont read its likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEGbased format  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file

1  A JFIFstandard file will start with the characters hex FF D8 FF E0
    followed by two variable bytes often hex 00 10 followed by JFIF

2  If you see FF D8 at the start but not the rest of it you may have a
    raw JPEG file  This is probably decodable asis by JFIF software 
    its worth a try anyway

3  HSI files start with hsi1  Youre out of luck unless you have HSI
    software  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they
    wont decompress properly with nonHSI programs

4  A Macintosh PICT file if JPEGcompressed will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header scan for JFIF  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it

5  Anything else its a proprietary format or not JPEG at all  If you are
    lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream look for FF D8
    try stripping off everything before that

In uuencoded Usenet postings the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	begin line
	MCX 

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	begin line
	MI 

If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading nonJFIF files


12  What about arithmetic coding

The JPEG spec defines two different back end modules for the final output
of compressed data either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed
The choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file  On typical images arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding  All the
filesize numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding

Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi
Thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses
from these companies  The fair use doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best

At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding the space savings isnt great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles  In particular arithmetic coding should not
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future  Stay tuned for further details


13  Does loss accumulate with repeated compressiondecompression

It would be nice if having compressed an image with JPEG you could
decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE  In general recompressing an altered
image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it without changing it then there is no further loss ie you get an
identical JPEG file  Even this is not true at least not with the current
free JPEG software  Its essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error  If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the firstgeneration
output  It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change
One of the things on our todo list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited but I am not optimistic about it

In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified fullcolor output of djpeg at the original
quality setting would introduce no further loss  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundofferror degradation
If youre wondering why its because the pixelblock boundaries move
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels you might be safe but
thats a mighty limited capability

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images but you dont want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps  Use a lossless format
PPM RLE TIFF etc while working on the image then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away  Aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot
of compressiondecompression time this way 


14  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG

As stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG  If you can obtain the original
fullcolor data the GIF was made from its far better to make a JPEG from
that  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG to
make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding GIF
that will give you a chance to redo the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs as explained in
section 3 in particular cartoontype GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
dont convert well  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be larger than the GIF  So check the sizes too

Experience to date suggests that large highvisualquality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings and they convert to JPEG with least degradation
Dont waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes  Also dont
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from fullcolor originals  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straightthrough
JPEG files would be ie shoot for 12 or 13rd the size of the GIF file
not 14th as suggested in earlier comparisons

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constantcolor
border around a GIF image  While useless this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files  It is NOT free in JPEG files and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing  If you are on an X Windows
system XVs manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this

cjpegs default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for fullcolor input but
for GIF inputs Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation  If you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher
Q setting may not be necessary

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store
If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value  The
trouble with dithering is that to JPEG it looks like highspatialfrequency
color noise and JPEG cant compress noise very well  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image if you had it
To get around this you want to smooth the GIF image before compression
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file while still obtaining a betterlooking output image
than youd get without smoothing

With the V4 free JPEG software or products based on it a simple smoothing
capability is built in  Try smooth 10 or so when converting GIFs
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for highquality GIFs  Heavyhanded
dithering may require larger smoothing factors  If you can see regular
finescale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong
smoothing is definitely called for  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image which you dont want  If you are an image processing
wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package  However cjpegs builtin smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol

The upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs  But if you really care about the
image youll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings
