In article C70zv49HqddtopperDundeeNCRCOM stephenc says

In 3D Studio is there any way to create refraction diffraction etc 

I want to simulate such things as glass lenses bottles etc

There might be an IPAS routine that does thatbut I canr be sure  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection but thats
the only thing I can think of
