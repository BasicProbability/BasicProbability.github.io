Subject TIFF 60

I recently read in a book that the TIFF version 60 specification was due
to be released in the spring of 1992  I am interested in finding out about
the new features of the TIFF spec and if it is out  Specifically I need
to know if TIFF 60 supports VQ decompression andor image
tiling
