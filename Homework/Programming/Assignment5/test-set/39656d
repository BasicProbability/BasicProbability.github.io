Subject Re What is this GL file

From article 1suntv3kmwatsonmtsuedu by csjohnwatsonmtsuedu John Wallace
 Ive got this animation file with a GL extension
 What is this  Are there anu MSDOS or OS2 programs
 which will run this file  Thanks
 

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames usually stored as PIC or CLP files fonts and a TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it  GL stands
for Grasp Library  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the altbinariespictures FAQ

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files and they are usually
named GRASPRTEXE replace the  with a version digit or letter  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardwarespecific to particular modes
of the CGA EGA or VGA adapters on PCs  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp I know that I got one there
a long time ago

		Good Luck
		Jack
