Subject Re VGA Graphics Library

Many highend graphics cards come with C source code for doing basic graphics
sorts of things change colors draw pointslinespolygonsfills etc  Does
such a library exist for generic VGA graphics cardschips hopefully in the
public domain  This would be for the purpose of compiling under a nonDOS
operating system running on a standard PC


Im also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
package to do PC VGA graphics  

Im currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a 
nonDOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics  Im not sure if 
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not  
I suspect Ill implement the display controller as a server process that 
handles graphics requests queued on a mailbox one at a time  If this 
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library  

Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something
what do you think
