Subject RayBezier Intersection Problem


If some kind person has access to a mathematical package such as Mathematica
Maple I would like to ask you for the solution to the following problem
I sometimes have algebra problems like this where I would like a simplified
symbolic solution Is there a FTPable package out there that can handle such
beasts

    I would like to solve the following ray  Bezier patch intersection
    for the scalar constant t in

        P                     t  V                  Quw
         origin point in 3D       dir vector 3D

    in terms of only
       
          P            V            P                     and various scalars
           origin    dir 3D    ij 0  ij  3

    where
