Subject Re Point in Polygon routine needed

Andrew Lewis Tepper at15andrewcmuedu writes
I dont know if this routine is standard I just came up with it recently
For a polygon of points p1pn and a point P make a table as follows
T1 angle from p1 to P to p2
T2 angle from p2 to P to p3

Tn angle from pn to P to p1
express all angles as PI  angle  PI
Add all entries in the table If the sum  0 the point is outside If
the sum is  PI the point is inside If the point is  xPI you
have a strange polygon If ANY angle was  PI the point is on the
border

     I think its known but its neat

     Can it be extended to 3D
