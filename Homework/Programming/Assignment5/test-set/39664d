If it takes making it an alt group then why not  Ive been following
this thread for what has it been two months now
The alt hierarchie is created for 2 purposes
1 For groups which do not fit under the comp or other official
  hierarchies
2 For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like altgulfwar
Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities
sites are free to decide not to carry some of the alt groups
Therefore it is I think desirable to try to create compgraphics
raytrace rendering or whatever and not an altgroup
