Id like to know if there is any system CPU  HD array  framebuffer
which can play and record HDTV quality moving picture in realtime

HDTV has about 6MBframe so recordingplaying moving picture will need
about 180MBsec bandwidth Im thinking to treat the raw data not
compressed 

	Actually for digital HDTV systems thats far higher bandwidth than
you need unless theres some reason you must work in fullyuncompressed
HDTV  Also my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB
even using 24 bitspixel which is more bits than you actually need  15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture  1600x1100x16bits is 35MB Im
guessing at HDTV resolution  it may be a bit wider than 1600 Im fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well  180MBs while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system

	Unless you have a very compelling reason Id advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data  You dont have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with
