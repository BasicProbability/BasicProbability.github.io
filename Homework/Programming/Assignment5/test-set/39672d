Subject Re Products to handle HDTV moving pircture 180MBsec

How does the 16 bit color of HDTV work  It can not be 5 bit Red Green and
Blue like on the Macintosh This gives only 64 gray levels

Apple also has developed a pointpoint network that is around 200MB not
sure if it is bits or bytes per sec
