Subject DEC or PC Graphics Tools

I am applying for an NSF grant to buy equipment for a laboratory

The lab will need to support C or Pascal with graphics tools


We can run the lab either on PCs or  DEC equipment  



If you are familiar with appropriate products softwarehardware and precise
prices Please contact

Also if anyone runs a lab using similar softwarehardware I would be very
interested in hearing your opinions of its success

Thanks
