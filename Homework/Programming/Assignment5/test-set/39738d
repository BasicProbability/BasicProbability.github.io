Subject Re 3d Head model  not again groan

OK sorry to post a question which seems to crop up
quite regularly in this group however I have yet
to get a specific and usefull in my context answer   
to where I can get hold of 3d data for a head

WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR 

Simple polyon description of head  face which can be EASILY
converted for or used with POV raytracer 
ie 1500 polygons

Well I am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
polygonal descriptions of a head face skull vase etc The format
of the files is a list of vertices normals and triangles There are
various resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number
of polygons eg phred13kvbl contains 1300 polygons


In order to get the data via ftp do the following

	1 ftp tauruscsnpsnavymil
	2 login as anonymous guest as the password
	3 cd pubdabro
	4 binary
	5 get cybertarZ

Once you get the data onto your workstation

	1 uncompress datatarZ
	2 tar xvof datatar

If you have any questions please let me know
