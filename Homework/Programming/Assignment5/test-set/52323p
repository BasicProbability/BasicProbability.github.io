Subject Modems Simple Question

 D I am going to purchase a Modem with a SR FAX capability Currently I 
 D am considering Suprav32bis or Global Village TeleportGold
 D  
 D The Global Village averages about 100 more is there an advantage
 D  
 D Concerning FAX  Do I need to be present when there are incoming FAX 
 D ie will the modem software recognize an incoming FAX and store the 
 D information Once received can I use Mac applications on the image
 D  

My telephone line seems pretty stable and I have the Supra as well  Works 
great but with every passing day I fall behind on how many great 144s are 
out  Zoom is out of the question from what Im hearing  ATT has a great 
product from what I hear and the Sportster is really cheap now too

If you want to receive a fax your computer will have to be on but not 
the monitor and of course the modem  You can set the number of rings that 
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software  
Its entirely up to you how to arrange that  Ive had faxes sent to me 
which is great but Ive been home to set it  I dont have a need to set 
fax receiving up all day  Also I hear there is a device that can channel 
all incoming phone signals for about 70  Rumor also that the phone 
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about 5 if thats what 
you need

Best of luck and write back if youd like more feedback
