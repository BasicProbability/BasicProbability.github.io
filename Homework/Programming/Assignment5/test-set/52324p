 Does anyone know of a program or utility that will
 enable the Mac to read Unix ie NeXT 35 in disks
 
 Thanks

I dont know the answer to your direct question but if the Mac Superdrive can  
read MSDOS disks can it then you can transfer files between the NeXT and  
a Mac by using MSDOS formatted disks since the NeXT can readwrite that  
format  And if youre interested in transferring files you can also do it  
over the serial port using kermit

cheers
