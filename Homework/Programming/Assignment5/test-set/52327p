this is a bad idea my machine is on 24 hours a day but its
actually 
doing things 24 hours a day i use it as an all purpose alarm
clock 
scheduler ive got routines that run in the middle of the night
phone 
calls it makes during the day when im out if your machine is on
24 hours 
a day then you can count on it to be working 24 hours a day i
could call 
it from work and download a file that i might need i could call it
from 
work and have it turn the lights on if im going to be late oops
more 
wasted electricity  but conversely i could have it turn the
lights 
off heck i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have
dinner 
ready when i get there

oh well nevermind im just babbling

All of those things that youve mention can still be accomplished
when the
machine is power down  When the previous poster said power
down it 
doesnt mean turning off the machine it just means that the machine
is
in an energy conserving mode that sucks up least electricity
