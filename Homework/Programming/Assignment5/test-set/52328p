story about dealing having problems wC610s deleted

So what does the net think Did the dealer just get one flaky
machine or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early
Is your C610 working just great or is it buggy too

Ive had my C610 for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever
Its been customized with

  replaced the AppleQuantum 80 drive with a Connor 212 drive  

  installed a Tandberg SCSI tape drive in the internal bay which works
   just fine though Apple doesnt seem to be supplying front panel
   bezels w a standard 525 cutout  

Its hooked up to an Apple LaserWriter Plus and has no printing
problems at all tested printing complex Photoshop graphics

It has expanded VRAM and extra 8 meg SIMM no problems

So in sum I have no idea what this dealer is complaining about
