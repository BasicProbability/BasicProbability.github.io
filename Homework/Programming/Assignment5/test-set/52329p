 I understand that if I have a correct adapter then I can
use a vga monitor with my IIsi
 Are those adapters working with specific brands
 Is adapter for NEC or Sony working with other brands
 I will be using a vga monitor with IIsi for a month soon
 I dont have any clue what monitor will be

Heres the story

1  The IIsi cannot supply a VGA output  However

2 Some VGAtype monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch high resolution color
displayie Apples own 640x480 mode

So if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi you
need a an adapter that converts from the Mac DB15 connector to the
VGAstyle high density DB15 connector but tells the Mac to use
its own 640x480 mode not the VGA 640x480 mode and b a VGA monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over
the VGA 640x480 mode which as I stated in 1 above the IIsi cannot
produce

As far as a above is concerned contact

They can probably get you the right adapter  Remember you do not
want the runofthemill MactoVGA adapter because it will try to
have your IIsi produce the VGA mode which it cannot the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all  Instead you want
an adapter that connects between the Macstyle and VGAstyle
connectors but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode  Sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction

As far as b is concerned make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of
67 Hz  These are the specs of Apples 640x480 mode  For comparison
the VGAstandard 640x480 mode uses a 315 KHz horizontal bandwidth and
a 60 Hz vertical retrace rate

The monitor will probably need to have autosynching capability as
the Apple mode youll be using isnt one of the set of standard modes
in the PC compatible world

Good luck
