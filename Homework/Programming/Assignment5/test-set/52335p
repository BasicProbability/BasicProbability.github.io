 I remember someone mention about a 150meg syquest  Has anyone else
 heard anything about this  Id be interested in the cost per megabyte and the
 approximate cost of the drive itself and how they compare to the Bernoulli 150

Bernoulli also offer 20MB floppy drives that read 14MB floppies Their 150MB Multidisk reads all formats and writes 90MB Bernoullis are installed in industrial computersmuch more rugged than Syquestyou get what you pay for I guesshavent heard about 150MB Syquest
