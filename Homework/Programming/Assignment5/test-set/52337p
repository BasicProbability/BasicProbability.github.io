 	I have an Ethernet card that i took out off an old LC The card
 	is manufactured by Asante On it i can read
 	Asante Tech inc Copyright 1991 MACCON  LC REVB
 	The card has an fpu socket on it It provides thin Ethernet connector
 	and theres another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors
 
 	My questions are
 	 Will this card work on any other model than LCserie  given that
 	its a PDS card will it work with the IIsi PDS slot  I think there
 	may be a probleme because the LC has 16 bit wide slots
 It probably wont work with any other LC  The ones I have for the LC II
 are Rev D  No it wont work in the IIsis PDS slot since its a 68030
 PDS while the LC has the 68020 PDS  The IIsi and SE30 share the same
 kind of card

  Ok i see Does Asante propose any upgrade for their cards  Do they have
  an email adress so i can ask them directly  Their Phone number will be
  Ok even if i pay the overseas call im really willing to know what to do
  with this card
