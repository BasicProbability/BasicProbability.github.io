 My friend recently purchased a LC III and he wants to know if there is
 such a demon called NuBus adapter for his PDS slot 

  The LC family of Macs can only
  use PDS cards They are not able to use NuBus

 Ah but why  Can some technicallyhip Macslinger tell us what the
 difference is between PDS and Nubus  

 Is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into PDS and ends in a
 Nubus card cage  At least Marvins friend has not been able to
 locate one and neither have I  What is the fundamental reason for
 this

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages Im sure Ive seen
them advertised occassionally but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother

Of course it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive

NuBus technology isnt a special Apple Proprietry thing I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments so there
is no problem building an expansion box

Apple uses the IEEE Nubus90 standard for their 32 bit backplane bus
I got this from a technote that I reada couple of weeks ago

Well almost NuBUS 90 anyway comprehensive bus contention between processors
is not supported in the current Macintoshes could be wrong

However I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself
dont ask Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard

Very interesting possibilities indeed

Hope this helps
