Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose
Next time you power down the computer check that all cables are on tight

I remember a simple program that would play those chimes for you when you
clicked their respective buttons  Does anyone know where that is  This was

   various stages of ram testing
