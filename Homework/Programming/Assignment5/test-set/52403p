Subject PowerPC and old Macs what happens then

I have a few questions that I would like answers to 
or opinions on since Im thinking about buying a LCIII

Q1 When the PowerPCbased Macs are announced what will
happen to the 680X0based Macs  

Q2 Is System 7 the last word for 680X0based Macs 
Will we ever get REAL multitasking for the Mac

Q3 Will there be a way for NuBUSPDSequipped Macs to add 
a PowerPConaboard to their systems

Id hate to think that Im going to put my  down
on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a
deadend product line

Thanks in advance
