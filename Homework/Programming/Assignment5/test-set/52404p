 My coworker has just attached a magnetooptical drive to his mac
 Works Great for him  However he tried to turn on file sharing but it
 wouldnt work  Had some message about Not all volumes are shareable
 

 So  has anyone had success in sharing MOs  If so please tell me how

Hi

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on and the only one
that can see the disk is the owner of the machine Im not sure but seems
that the check Allow owner to see entire disk should be enabled too

A bad thing you cant eject the disk until FS is turned off

Hope that helps
