I ordered an external floppy drive from them 2 years ago  When I placed
the order they said it was in stock and would ship the next day  A week
passed and no drive  I called them up and they said they were out of stock
and my drive should ship in 2 weeks or so  Since I needed the drive right
away both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead I cancelled my
order and havent dealt with them since

I too had a very unpleasant experience with Hardware Thats Shi It
featured repeated lies about when things had shipped a salesperson who
was totally ignorant about what he was selling a charge for duties I
had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor their
house brand 2page monochrome that was the most unadulterated piece of
junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of
electronics

I shipped it back and they refunded my money but it still cost me
something over 200 for long distance charges nonrefundable taxes
and duties and lost time

Dont deal with them
