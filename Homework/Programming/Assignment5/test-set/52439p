Applied Engineering used to sell a 35 disk drive for the Apple IIgs that
read and wrote 16 meg on a HD disk  I wonder if the drive would work on a
mac since Im using my old 35 drive from my IIgs on my IIsi now  Just a
thought

In article C64J1nHpqcsulbedu sluhbeachcsulbedu Jeff Masud writes
A friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can
format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a HD disk Apparently it
rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or something that allows it get
more space out of a normal HD floppy disk  It supposedly gets upto 16 Megs
so something like 1640K I dont have the program  since I cant use it
and its supposed to be called something like FORM16 or something like that

My question is whether its possible to do this on the Mac and if its not
possible is it due to hardware limitations A developer friend of mine said
that it might be possible but he doesnt deal with this aspect of the field
much

Thanks for any information contributed
