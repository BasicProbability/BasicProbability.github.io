Subject Datatransferrate of the new 2100 series FS2 Micropolis hds

I have a question for yall

Im looking at an ad for the new 35 FAST SCSI2 drives from Micropolis
in the June 1993 MacWorld I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions
in IBM PC magazines

Well the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI2 interface
but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytessecond
max

How can this be  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI2 it
had to have a DTR of 10megs a second

I am assuming the 5megssec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache
I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can readwrite data
at 5megs a second

Thank you
