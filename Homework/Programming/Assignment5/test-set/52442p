Subject Quadra PDS Video Cards

 
A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra 900 maybe 950 with 
all but one NuBus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video
card  He reports 8 bit video is too slow for good realtime display of
what he needs to see  He also reports that the builtin video is even
worse  Hes not a Mac guru and I havent seen the system so this is
about all I know

I suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded and think improvements might
come from a switch to an accelerated PDS slot video card  Does this
sound right  Who makes a PDS accelerated video card for the Quadra thats
worth looking at  Any other suggestions  Thanks in advance
