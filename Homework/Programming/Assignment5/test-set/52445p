Subject HELP formatting NT disk array

	
	I have a Northern Telecom disk array dated 1987 that has two 253MB drives
units in it and I cannot get it formatted  I set the SCSI ID on 1 and my
software recognizes the unit but I cannot mount it or anything  do I have
to use BOTH drives in the array 

	Any help with these drives or possibly newer software than what Im using
FWB HDT10 and 11 will be greatly appreciated
