No  Well again I stated that a painless death isnt cruel but I dont
think I stated that all painful executions are cruel  I think that some
are cruel depending on the nature and duration of the pain

	But hanging is certainly painful Or do you not let the condemned 
know they are going to die


Anything more than an instant I guess  Any death by suffocation
asphyxiation or blood loss would be cruel I think this includes the
gas chamber and drawing and quartering  Id say that any pain that
lasts say over twenty seconds or so would be too long but this may
be an arbitrary cutoff I suppose

	Hanging is not supposed to be very pleasant I believe that in 
actuality it is not quick and clean However gas chambers can be
quite nonpainful Heck why not give them a good time Suffication by
Nitrious Oxide
