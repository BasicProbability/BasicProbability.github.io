Im sure all the religious types would get in a snit due
to Asimovs atheism

Can someone confirm this  Someone told me that Asimov converted to
Christianity at some point or something  Does anyone have any good
quotes

What  Absolutely not  No way  Asimov was a lifelong atheist and
said so many times right until his death  Judging from the many
stories he told about his own life he felt culturally closest to
Judaism which makes sense He was born Jewish
