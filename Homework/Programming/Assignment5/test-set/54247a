 Bill this is wonderfully phrased I assume you understand that your
 statement is also undermining such human constructs as religion
 as well

Ill accept this as a compliment although Im always a little paranoid
when visiting aa thanks Yes I do know the extent of the statements
relevence its what I think of as human nature Im not sure it
undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special
knowledge about the Truth and since such claims are always suspect
all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species
My point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human
claims The trick here then is to find some way to abstract our
infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we
can see what there is to see I can think of no way this can be done
