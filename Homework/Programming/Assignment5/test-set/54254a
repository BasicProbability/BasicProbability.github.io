In this respect since atheists are dominantly arrogant and claim 
selfcontrol and selfownership they would make pharoahs 
look like very humble decent people in comparison  If the logic is this
since I own myself others who are like me should also own themselves and
going further things are selfexistent and selfstanding and selfliving
etc 

Yes atheists tend to claim self control and self ownership Are you saying
that theists claim to not have self control I dont think atheists are
dominantly arrogant They dont claim some god that has supremacy over
all of mankind Now this claim would be arrogant but atheists dont claim 
it Most atheists do claim to own themselves I think any disagreement with
this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant

to base their lives through their hearts anything can happen A dangerous 
situation in my opinion Bobby Mozumder describing problems with atheism
