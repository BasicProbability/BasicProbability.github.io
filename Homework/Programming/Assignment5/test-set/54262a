  I guess I dont understand the problem  Ive never had any
  problem swearing and using the name of god in the same sentence
  Comes quite naturally as a matter of facxt


I would guess that you either mean that you dont have a problem
swearing aligance to a nonexistant being or that you are being
deliberatily dense considering what group this is  

It doesnt come quite naturally to nonbelievers such as myself
or even to followers of other religions  Would you say it would
be quite natural if you were forced to swear by Allah or
Budda
