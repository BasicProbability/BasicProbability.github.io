Subject Re solvent for ducttape adhesive

I know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean ducttape adhesive from carpet

Yet another suggestion but this one is nontoxic although I would handle
it like any other cleaner and it smells nice  The chemical is called
dLimonene and it smells like lemon peels I think it is a lemon extract
of some kind  You might find it in a hardware store sold as a
generalpurpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store 
it is used as a chaincleaning fluid  It works on sticker glue crayons
grease oil etc

Its clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add
water it changes to a creamy consistency which is good for some jobs
