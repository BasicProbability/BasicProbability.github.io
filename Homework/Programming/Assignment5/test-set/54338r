Does anyone know of any type of acceleration sensor that has
an electrical output of any sort  It would only have to sense
acceleration in one direction

Gee how about an ahem accelerometer Such devices are available from
a variety of sources one that comes to mind is Bruel  Kjaer if you have
a lot of money to spend MOst of these sorts of devices output a voltage
proportional to acceleration You need to know what range youre talking
about though
