 you are removing the goo use pure grain alcohol  If the alcohol does
 not work try carbon tetrachloride If neither of these work you may need to
                

DO NOT HEAT THE CCL4  IT MAKES PHOSGENE GAS of WWI poison gas fame

remember when they used carbon tet in fire extinguishers


yes I know I was yelling
