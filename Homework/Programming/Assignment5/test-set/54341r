Rubbish The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder

The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without
any solder mask you can tell from the copper colored traces The box
labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflonglass board while the one
in the center has the grayish board exposed  On the left is some 
fiberglass board that looks green to me  I see no reason
for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers 

I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps  Often microwave circuits have odd
bits of wirefoilmetal attached to whereverwhatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly this is a commercial product  A
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher never mind 
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits  Q dope
for coils does not improve the Qit just holds things together with
minimal loss

mask that is used Older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used
a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments The light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced The blue and red
or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner Theres a lot of info
about the pros and cons of each but thats another story
