 	Im trying to bring in 8 bits to a PC and would like
 	to use interruptdriven routines Without buying an IO
 	board or making a new port where can I bring in these
 	bits LPT seems to have only a few inputs but Ive heard
 	rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional lines Anybody
 	know fer sure If any bid LPTs which boards have them
 	Ill be running a new 386DX33
 
  
         Yes it is possible  Im making a 7 stepper controller board 
 with 7 digital inputs and up to 18 digital outputs from the  port
    One main thing that will tell you whether the  port is 
 bidirectional or not is the bus tranceiver on it  Look for a chip 
 numbered 74LS245  If you dont have this then its probably a 74LS244 
 which will do you NO good for reading in
   
           Now if you do have the 245 then do the following
   First find the address of the port decimal either 888 or 632
   In pascal you would WritePortxxx where xxx is the address in 
 either hex or decimal  The status lines pins 14 16 17 as well as the 
 strobe pin 1 are bidirectional lines and are read by base address 2 
 so for 888 to read from status then read from 890  You can also output 
 to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines  In pascal 
 do Portxxxvalue
 
  
                 Hope this helps
         Let me know if you need more help

AS IT HAPPENS YOUVE HELPED ME QUITE A BIT IM CONSIDERING BUILDING
A VERY SIMILAR DEVICE JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DO THIS SUMMER
THE IDEA IS TO CODE THE 8 OUTPUT BITS INTO MULTIPLE 2BIT 
CURRENTAMPLIFIED OUTPUT CHANNELS  SOFTWARE WILL HANDLE THE WAY THE 
AMPLIFIED OUTPUTS ARE MANIPULATED SO THAT THIS MAGIC BOX CAN HANDLE
MORE APPLICATIONS THAN JUST STEPPER MOTORS  ALSO LOOKING FOR A ROBOT ARM
CHEAP TO ATTACH THIS BOX TO SO I CAN WOW AND IMPRESS MY FRIENDS
    ANY HINTS       PETER J DEMKO ME170PJDUVMEDU
