         A while ago I saw some translucent pads about 6x8 or so that 
could be plugged into something and they would glow  One was red 
another green another blue  Interresting  I was wondering if anyone 
would have a feed on anything of this nature and of the price
   oh the pads were rubberlike and were floppy like about 1cm thick or 
so

The curiosities that you speak of are EL ElectroLuminescent pads  They
are mostly used as backlights for LCDs and as you pointed out comes
in several different colors  Many of them emit whiteish colors true
white and bluewhiteisblue are the ones that Ive personally encountered
the most often

They vary in their input requirements however they tend to operate at 
about 100 Vrms and at much higher than 60 Hz  400 Hz to 1 kHz if I 
recall correctly   You can get them to work at 120 Vrms 60 Hz ie
line but they dont glow as brightly and they will degrade much faster
Oh yes almost forgot ELs have this tendency to wear out over time
