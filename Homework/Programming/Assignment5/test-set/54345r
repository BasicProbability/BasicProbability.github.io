Subject Pressure Zone Microphones

I remember back before commercial mikes with the PZM label for
Pressure Zone Microphone started showing up I read an article
in some engineering journal that described the principles involved
All the physics aside from a practicle standpoint the authors said
they built a prototype with nothing more than a small Sony lavelier
mike laid up against a large aluminum disk  In demonstrating it at
a presentation to audio engineers this was impressive enough that
the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them

AnywayI want to build some to use as choir mikes wide coverage
Ive had good luck using some small electret mike elements I got
from DigiKey  most of these are limitedbandwidth peakey units
but for a buck or two more I got the ones specd to go out to 20kHz
with a bit flatter response  

The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of
critical  Im debating whether to mount it on its side which
puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate or mounting
it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a
small clearance  I havent dissected a unit like you can buy at
Radio Shack to see how they do it  Thoughts
