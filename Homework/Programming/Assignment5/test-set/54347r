 	Im trying to bring in 8 bits to a PC and would like

 	board or making a new port where can I bring in these

 	rumours that some LPTs have bidirectional lines Anybody
 	know fer sure If any bid LPTs which boards have them
 	Ill be running a new 386DX33

I know for sure that the Everex Magic IO EV170A can be jumpered
for a printer mode or for a general purpose bidirectional IO mode

Also I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following
about the Monochrome Display  Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer
Adapter

    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these
    lines referring to the data lines to ground

And later

    If an external device should be driving data on these pins in
    violation of usage ground rules at the time of an input this
    data will be ored with the latch contents

I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
as a result of my saying I DO NOT know for sure but I think
you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
port by writing 0x to the data lines and then reading from the
data lines while an external device drives them  The input
data will not be latched so noise could make this infeasible
