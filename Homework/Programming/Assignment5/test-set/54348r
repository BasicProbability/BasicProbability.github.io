 The color of the board shows the composition of it hence the use of it
 
 Original and older boards were bakelite composition and were brown
 Phenolic spelling was a tan
 Most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green
 Filled fiberglass is blue
 Teflon is white
 
 
 Rubbish The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
 mask that is used Older boards bakelite and phenolic rarely used
 a solder mask these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
 and soldering techniques and hence are the colour of the compound
 used to make them These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
 general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
 close traces shorting to one another during soldering and also to prevent
 the decomposition of traces under harsh environments The light and dark
 green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them usually
 applied as a complete film photographically produced The blue and red
 or orange boards are a twopart epoxy or a liquidimageable resist
 formulation and are applied in a different manner Theres a lot of info
 about the pros and cons of each but thats another story

Sorry Geoff

Agree solder mask is green but in the old days we didnt have wave soldering
machines which are another topic again  I had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning

Board under the mask was the original query

BTW cheap inport electronic devices mainly from 3rd world countries are done
with brown pheonolic boards  Is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home  They are very obviously hand soldered  Quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into Canada from Red China  In China there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works its yours  One of my
coworkers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost 50

Also the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press  An old lithographer friend had a press for this  After the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors
