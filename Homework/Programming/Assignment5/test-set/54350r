	Just a quick question  What standard lab solvents can be used to
clean electronic equipment and components safely ie not corrode dissolve
shortout etc the equipment
	water	
	methanol
	CCl4

You dont say what kind of electronic equipment you mean  Its hard
to give a generic answer  There is essentially no solvent that wont
do things like washing lubricant out of switches

When weve needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things weve just
used distilled water  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear
is completely dry before powering it up again  We let it dry for
several days to be damn sure

I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water  I would
be very wary of CCl4 not least because it is dangerous to you even
if its not going to harm the equipment  not only is it poisonous
but I believe its now known to be carcinogenic
