Not that the question is anything important but I am still curious
Why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green I have seen
a few blue ones but no red yellow company logo etc Is there a
technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
not tought about it yet

       Its possible to make boards in other colors and I have an ad
for laser lightshow equipment which offers the circuit boards in your
choice of DayGlo tm colors

       The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas
The dark green or blue is the solder mask layer and I suspect that color
is a dye
