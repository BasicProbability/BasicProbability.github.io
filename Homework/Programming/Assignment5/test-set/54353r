I remember back before commercial mikes with the PZM label for
Pressure Zone Microphone started showing up I read an article
in some engineering journal that described the principles involved
All the physics aside from a practicle standpoint the authors said
they built a prototype with nothing more than a small Sony lavelier
mike laid up against a large aluminum disk  In demonstrating it at
a presentation to audio engineers this was impressive enough that
the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them

Yup its not all that difficult to do

AnywayI want to build some to use as choir mikes wide coverage
Ive had good luck using some small electret mike elements I got
from DigiKey  most of these are limitedbandwidth peakey units
but for a buck or two more I got the ones specd to go out to 20kHz
with a bit flatter response  

The Panasonic cartridges arent bad but they arent spectacular

The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of
critical  Im debating whether to mount it on its side which
puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate or mounting
it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a
small clearance  I havent dissected a unit like you can buy at
Radio Shack to see how they do it  Thoughts

Dont mount it on the side  Call up Crown the company that has the
patent on the PZM and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things  You may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance

Crown has a nice book on the subject though its unfortunately rather
short on mathematics  Theres a JAES article from many years back too

Still for your application youll be a lot better off buying the cheap
Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastocznys modifications to get a
clean balanced output  Phils mods seem to get reposted here on a regular
basis
