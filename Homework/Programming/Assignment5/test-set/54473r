 Regarding pointing an antenna at a leaky CATV cable
 
 Wow what a concept  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
 nonconnection would fit into the theft of cable services laws
 It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
 the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
 stand upon in court
 
 Well the CATV company in the US is accountable to the FCC for how
 much transmission their cables make  In fact Ive heard first hand
 about how the CATV company asked to inspect the wiring in a
 homebusiness to find the source of RF leaks  Ive heard many of their
 vans have RF detectors and they keep one eye on them as they drive down
 the street
 
 If the cable is leaky enough to have usable signal I would GUESS that
 theyre probably in violation of FCC transmission laws
 
 In England they do did require permits to OPERATE A TV
 Supposedly the TV police drove around with RF detectors looking for
 the IF or whatever produced by a receiver that wasnt registered  Im
 guessing the purpose was just something else they could get away with
 taxing  I dont know if the TV police wereare just urban legend or
 an actuality

The TV Police are still with us Im afraid A 1000 pound fine goes out to
the unlicensed usersif caught
