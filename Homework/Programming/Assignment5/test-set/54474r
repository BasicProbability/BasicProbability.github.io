In England they do did require permits to OPERATE A TV
Supposedly the TV police drove around with RF detectors looking for
the IF or whatever produced by a receiver that wasnt registered  Im
guessing the purpose was just something else they could get away with
taxing  I dont know if the TV police wereare just urban legend or
an actuality

They are real and we still pay licence fees to receive TV
The detector vans pick up the IF true This tells them what channel you
are watching The can also pick up the line time base freq and frame rate
Try it with a LWMW radio near telly it picks up a sharp hum

From this they can even watch poor quality though what you have on the
screen by picking up re radiating junk
