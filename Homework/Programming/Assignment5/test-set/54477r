Subject Re Microcontroller Questions for newcomer

Does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data IO print spooler
digital sampling etc would be better implemented with a DMA chip or a
dedicated microcontroller  Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best
way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a
memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use
by the smart data IO
 
Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use  Fast cheap and easy
to obtain would be nice but I wont limit my choices to only those that fit
those characteristics  Even an 80868088 under 5 would do what I want
but I am sure there is a better alternative  like a microcontroller with
onchip EEPROM
 
So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simple
to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a
few IO lines
