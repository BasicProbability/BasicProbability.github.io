Lighter fluid is butane  Its absolutely nontoxic but is an extreme fire
                     
hazard  You definately dont want to go splashing this stuff around
Use a little on an old rag

Butane  A colourless flammable gaseous alkane

Nontoxic It has some effects when you inhale allegedly which cant all be down
to asphyxia IMHO
