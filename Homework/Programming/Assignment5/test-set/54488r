 I dont know for sure that this will work but you might try MEK
methyl
 ethyl keytone  It worked getting the stickum left over from
shelf paper
 etc
 If you use MEK for your sake wear safty glasses or better still
 industrial goggles The small est drop in the eye will casue  
etc
 
 Please watch those attributions  It was NOT ME that advocated using
MEK
