Im trying to build a mixer for a friend of mine to run several things into
a single boom box  I have a circuit that uses an opamp powered by either a
couple of 9V batteries or using some kind of power supply  But in a catalog
I was looking at recently a passive mixer for guitar was advertised taht
doesnt appear to use any power at all  Does anyone know what the circuit for
this would be because then I could just adapt it for RCA jacks and save my
friend and I alot of messing with batteries and plugs  Thanks

Well the fastest crudest mixer aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources arent driving directly into each other 

Taking a wild seatofthepants guess Id say that if you are mixing
highimpedance sources like some dynamic mikes electric guitar pickups
etc your resistors ought to be maybe 5K  10K or so  If you are mixing
linelevel stuff or the outputs of a Walkman or such Id go with 1K

input 1   output
                               
input 2 
                               
input 3
