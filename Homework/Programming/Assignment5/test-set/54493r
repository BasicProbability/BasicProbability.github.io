Subject Re WD40 as moisture repellant was Lead Acid batteries  C

I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke87 multimeter
suggests applying WD40 to the test lead sockets especially the
current range socket  The intention is to prevent the
testleadisinthewrongscocket beeper from going off when there
is no test lead in that socket

The manual is a bit vague but I think Id apply the WD40 to a
swab then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly
from the can

Speaking of said meters  I compared the 87 against the 8060A that
Ive had on my bench for almost 11 years  It has been five years
since the 8060A has been calibrated  On the DC scale they agree
within 01 mV  AC scale is within about 1 mV  The 87 would be
just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale I
didnt feel it was worth the extra 100 for a second 8060 since I
dont use dB all that much in my work
