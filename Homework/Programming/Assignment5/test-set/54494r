Subject Re Using generated power on large sound systems

Ive bothered the rental shops and audio shops about the problem but most of
them have precious little experience in dealing with generated power  My
suspicion is that I dont really need anything larger than 2KW and this could
all be resolved with a transformer of some sort

Nope  Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the
long cable from the generator or just plain not having enough power  I
would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short
peaks

You can try using larger and shorter cables to the generator or try
strapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out
which will minimize the line drop  If these dont work though youre
going to need a bigger generator

I assume that youre using wellmaintained generators and have watched the
voltage output on the generator properly  If you dont have 120V coming out
of the unloaded generator youll never get 120V at the other end

Can anyone offer any advice  I want to do a lot of outdoor events this
summer and it would be nice if this power problem could be resolved easily
Ive been looking into buying a powerpack so I could tap into junction boxes
directly but have no idea where to start  One that would resolve my
generator problems as well would be of high value to me

I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of
work and not with the proaudio people  Also I recommend that you dont
try to tap into junction boxes at all but hire a licensed electrician if
you dont really know what you are doing  Ive had to clean up after two
people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot 200A boxes and it wasnt
much fun
