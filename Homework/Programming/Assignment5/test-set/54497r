I dont know for sure that this will work but you might try MEK methyl
ethyl keytone  It worked getting the stickum left over from shelf paper
and is available at paint stores  Use a carbon gas mask and lots of
ventilationthis stuff really stinks

If you use MEK for your sake wear safty glasses or better still
industrial goggles The small est drop in the eye will casue
blindness by a catalysis reaction that is non cureavble once it starts
The results are similar to mustard gas contamination Note MEK peroxide
is a hardner form fibreglass resins
