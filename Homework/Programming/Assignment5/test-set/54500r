Subject Re Why circuit boards are green

Fiberglass boards are available in several colors  Sitting right
here I have unetched board stock that is white blue green and
yellow respectively  Ive also seen black boards

Solder mask is available in a variety of colors too  Depending on
the supplier the color helps indentify the material

Dont forget conformal coating

I dont think Ive seen phenolic impregnated paper boards in
anything other than the familar brown but it would not be
difficult to add a dye to change the color
