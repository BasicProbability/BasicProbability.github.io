Subject Re NHL LETTER  Rogers Response

I wouldnt say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to  It represents a subset that you
dont belong to of a larger group which you do if only because this
isnt a moderated group

And you can bet that I wouldnt be the only one not belonging to the
moderated group if it was moderated by an anallyretentive little
dullard like yourself 

Look there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint  Three
that come to mind are as follows

I hardly need you to presume to lecture me on how to communicate my points
of view  This posting that you have made is the second on the subject of
the NHL letter and you have yet to communicate your opinion on the matter
Instead you content yourself with flaming me

3 Say it directly and obnoxiously  Result

Result
Moronic little busy bodies like yourself take advantage of a perceived
opportunity to post rules for others to live by 

You realize that anything you say can and most certainly will be
used against you

Well if using it against me means you are going to post something of
significance then by all means go ahead  I insist  Otherwise why dont
you just go back to sleep or do whatever it is that you do when you are 
all by yourself
