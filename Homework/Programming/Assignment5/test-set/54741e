Subject Re Leafs What happened

Hi guys

What happened
	1  Potvin didnt let six goals by
	2  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up
	3  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs
		the emotional edge
	4  Refs calls especially last night tended to favour Leafs

	A couple of comments

	1  On Gilmour  Just because the guy isnt one of the three
	stars doesnt mean he was not leading the team  Someone posted
	the playoff point total and hes in something like fifth or sixth
	placeplus he walked away with the Molson cup given for
	accumulating points from the three star selection during the
	regular season

	2  On the officiating  Ive heard gripes from both ends on this
	one  Emotions are very high in this series  the rivalry is
	one of the stronger ones I know of  I do have to agree that the
	officiating last night was proLeaf in general except for whoever
	missed that slash on Gilmours hand

	3  In general  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better
	chances vs Pittsburgh though I think the Leafs would do better
	against the Bluesbut not as well if they made it out of the
	division Problem is I like both these teams though Im
	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle  D

	By the wayGilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not
		playing aggressive hockey
	By the wayIm not any sort of expert nor do I claim to be
		I just like watching a good matchup


	tee hee heeooops
