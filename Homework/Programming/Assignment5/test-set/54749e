 Im just wondering where all the Bruins fans are  I mean they woofed it
 up with about 1000000 posts during the regular season saying that their
 fave team was going to kick everyones  in the playoffs and win the Stanley
 Cup  While I see nothing wrong with a little ranting and raving Im just
 curious why all the Boston faithful have stopped posting  I mean I havent
 even see just one little Boston fan post cept for the Bruins fans that
 arent cocky  Well maybe theyre all out on the golf course or something
 but I dont know Id sure like to see where all those Bruins fans are at 
 
  Robbie Po           1993s STREAKERS   We do what comes naturally
 Patrick Division Semis   PGH PENGUINS  You see now wait for the
 PENGUINS 4 Devils 3     1991 1992 STANLEY possibility dont you see a
 Penguins lead 30       CUP CHAMPIONS   strong resemblanceDG 89


Here in the middle of Connecticut there are plenty of Bruin Fans many who have
let me know in no uncertain terms that the Rangers choked down the stretch  I
think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did theyre
playing too tight  Whos responsibility is it to check Mogilny  He has
gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds
which are not being cleared by the Bs defense  Its too bad the Bs might not
get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again  I would really enjoy seeing
Ulfie get beat up by Neely  We all hate Ulfie but would love him on are
team
