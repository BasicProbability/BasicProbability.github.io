Okay the Caps AGAIN are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
do does anyone have the history of the Washington Capitals futility
record in the playoffs I remember that Terrys first year was the first

Dont give up so soon  A lot of Burgh fans didnt give up at 31 last year
You gotta believe  Hard as that may seem  With the Caps with the 1 power
play in the playoffs and 1 penalty killing according to Mike Lange all
the Caps have to do is make sure it doesnt go OTas that was Bostons and
Chicagos demise  OT can be a curse
