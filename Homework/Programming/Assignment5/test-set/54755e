Subject Re CBC Canadian for ESPN

In article C63tEF63Ccsdalca reinigerugcsdalca Darren Reiniger says

 Id like to echo these sentiments  This is the worst coverage I can
 ever remember seeing on CBC  As soon as the game ends I can count to 30
 and by that time theyve signed off the air  No post game interviews
 no updating of late scores nothin  TSN is really putting CBC to
 shame  I only hope the later round coverage improves I mean who
 really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey

 My 02
  Darren

This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News they argued that if youre
going to play  havoc with the schedule you should  at least make sure that
Prime Time is aired as soon as possible News got a commitment that the
postgame show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within
one minute or so of the game  ending

As for the earlier comments about CBC being Ontariocentric frankly
the no doubleheader decison goes both ways people in the West cant  see
the Leafs  and people in Central Canada cant see the Jets game The
reason for the decision was CBCs feeling they couldnt sell advertising
for six hours of hockey in  one night

 As for who wants to see news over hockey a lot of people CBC always gets
plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule

 People who wonder where this generation is going should remind themselves

 where it came from in the first place
