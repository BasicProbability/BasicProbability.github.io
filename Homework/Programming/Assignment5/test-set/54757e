 Speaking of Paddockwhats he doing slagging Sandlak  If Sandlak puts  
 his mind to it he can be a physical presence and waking him up might be a

	Isnt Sandbag out with an injury now anyways  Perhaps Paddock
meant to say that Momesso was the cheap short artist  After all that
would make more sense
