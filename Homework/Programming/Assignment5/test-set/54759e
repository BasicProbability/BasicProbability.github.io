Oh yeahand I CAN go to the Arena and see not one not two but
six championship banners hanging from the rafters  3 Stanley Cup
banners and 3 Avco Cup banners  My NHL guide says that Vancouver has
won the Cup once as many times as the rockin town of Kenora has won it

Dont let this confuse anybody  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the
Stanley Cup or even come that close  These Stanley Cup championships
go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century  The Winnipeg
Victorias won one or more of these Cups the Jets didnt win any of
them

Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff
series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn
of the century

Lets face facts  The Canucks are leading the series 31  The Canucks
dominated the Jets in their season series  The Canucks did better in
the regular season than Winnipeg  Who is the better team  I think
that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg
