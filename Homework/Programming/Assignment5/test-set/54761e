In an article published in this mornings Pittsburgh Post Gazette
KBL the Pgh cable sports channel President Bill Craig has 
confirmed that he has had preliminary talks with the Mouth of
the North Don Cherry  Craig said he is interested in hiring Cherry
as color commentator and for post game duties

Others being considered for the open broadcasting jobs are current
Pens announcers Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald Craig spoke to
both yesterday KBLs Stan Savaran and Guy Junker ESPNs Mike
Emrick MN broadcaster Doug McCloud and TSNs Jim Hughson

KBL and the Penguins have just inked a new deal giving KBL all 
TV and radio rights to Pens games  Plans are that KBL would like
to have an entire night of hockey starting with a 700 pregame
show and running to a post game show that would sign off about 1100
depending upon length of the game

Don Cherry announcing Penguins games  Yeah and to quote Pghs
goofy mayor Im the Queen of Sheba

Considering how often and how badly he has slammed the Pens on Coachs 
Corner on Hockey Night in Canada it would surprise me as well  But then
people will do anything for money wont they
