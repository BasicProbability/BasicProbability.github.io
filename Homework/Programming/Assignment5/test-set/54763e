If the Oilers move to Hamilton what division will they play in 

And wont they have to change their name to the Steelers or something
The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by
the tire fire a  few years back

Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the LA Lakers think about
it what lakes are in LA then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers
