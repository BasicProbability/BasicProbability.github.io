  Paul Stewart called the single worst game Ive seen this year
 Federovs major was obvious and I dont dispute it  
However Chaissons penalty shouldnt even have been a penalty let alone
 a major and a game misconduct


I dont notice refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around and
yes I have to agree that Stewart called the two worst games Ive seen
so far MtlQuebec game 1 and last nights TorontoDetroit game

Whats the scoop on this guy Is he the latest incarnation of
KERRY FRASER Just because you are boneheadedly stubborn doesnt
make you a good ref Making the right call does

My votes for
Best Ref Van Hellemond
Most Improved Koharski
Worst Paul Stewart

Oops I dont really want to start a bestworst ref thread so dont
follow up
