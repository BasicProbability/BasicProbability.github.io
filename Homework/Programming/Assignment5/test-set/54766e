Subject Re Don CherryNew Pens Annoucer

KBL and the Penguins have just inked a new deal giving KBL all 
TV and radio rights to Pens games  Plans are that KBL would like
to have an entire night of hockey starting with a 700 pregame
show and running to a post game show that would sign off about 1100
depending upon length of the game
