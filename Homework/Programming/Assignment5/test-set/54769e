Subject Minnesota Shame

SHIm a hockey fan from way back and maintain an interest as best I can
  here in the hockey hinterlands Oklahoma  Im hoping I can get a
  reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas

SHIve been under the impression that Minnesota was one of or possibly
  THE hockey state in the US  So why is the team moving to a city in
  Texas  Is it that the owner is a greedy selfserving profiteer or
  were the Stars really not making a profit  Or was the city or whoever
  owned the arena doing some price gouging

SHAs much as Id like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me I
  cant help but feel for the people in Minnesota unless they truly
  didnt support the team

SHOpinions please

I used to work for the Stars  Minnesota supported the team to an
extent  When I was there we had quite afew sellouts This was the
season after the cup run and during the finals  Norms main bitch was
that there wasnt enough luxury suites  And the ones he had were not
always full  He wanted more boxes and wanted them full  He was just
asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games
at High Schools for 5 or college for about 10 that would probably be
better
