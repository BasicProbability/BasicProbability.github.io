Subject WashIsl OT game


	This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio
for ESPN hockey

	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the PittNJ game 
even though the outcome was certain because of fear of the WashNy game 
going to overtime  When the Caps scored with 02 left to tie the game Al said
he heard many people say fK   
	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT
broadcast the OT of the hockey game  Next year ESPN2 will be introduced so 
baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey

	GET OFF ESPNS BACK AND STOP POSTING ARTICLES ON THIS SUBJECT
There have been to many fn complainers about this game that its making me
sick
