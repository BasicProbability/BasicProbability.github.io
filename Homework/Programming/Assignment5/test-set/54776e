   Which doesnt mean much since the statistics are mostly based on
the 5game playoff format But yes it looks dark for the Bs What a
disappointment

The Fat Lady is about to hit the first noteOkayhow about 30 deficits
The Bs chances for a comeback are now less 1Thats based on 7game
playoff format

   Who do you think gets the start in game three I hope it is going
to be Blue If the team can rally around him maybe Moog can too
 
He got the start but the headlines on all Boston local TV sportscats
said it all  Sutter Blue It And he did

Harry Sindens appearance outside of Bs dressing room after Game 3
was a pathetic site He said something really retarded to cover Sutters
behindThis game is not about winning or losing Harrycheck the
schedule Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer
vacation on Sunday morning

Harry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up
in a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the
businessBrian Sutter Sutters playoff record as the head coach in StLouis
speaks for itself The Blues really have a chance to advance to the
second round this year
