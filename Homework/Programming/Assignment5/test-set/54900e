Dear Mr Bettman 

Alis letter deleted for brevity

 Rogers acidlaced response removed
Maybe we should get together and establish some kind of mandatory maturity
level to keep some of this stuff off of the air

Roger
Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions
then  You see the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL
are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like
wheat at harvesttime  She never said she represented the entire
internet or the entire group recsporthockey  She has every right to
state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or
hundredodd folk whove agreed to allow her to list their names on the
bottom of it  You may not agree with it  Fine  I really dont care
enough about the name change to care  Your name isnt attached to it
so why moan and complain  If you felt her words were leading well
youre free to feel that way and take exception but manners never
hurt  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine
I have the right to think and say that too  Alis under no
compunction to change a single word  Now while youre free to
disagree with every word she wrote to tear apart her character is
uncalled for  Im posting this as a form of public reprimand  If you
tear down Alis integrity and character publicly youll get chastised
publicly in return  Would it have been so hard to say Ali please
be a bit more specific in your description the way Ive read it
indicates youre stating my view also and thats simply not true
Id really like to see a disclaimer noting that you dont mean the
entire internet or the entire rsh group attached to it despite
your intent to list names at the bottom  Thanks  Cordially as
always c  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the
weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of
myself and possibly others  

Oh and Ali nice to see someone standing up for something even if
its not something I personally advocate
