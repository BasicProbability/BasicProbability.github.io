  If anybody wanted proof of the nonsense of the you cant build guns claim
  they need look no farther than the Philippines  Amateur gunsmiths there
  regularly produce everything from 45 automatics to full auto shotguns  Now
  if this guy wants to claim that the Philippines is either technologically
  superior to the US or that their transportation is better than ours all I
  can say is that hes living in a fantasy world
 
 Unfortunately a few of those 45s blow up in your hands

Thats life  First you marry Imelda Marcos then you die 

 On the other hand my compatriots built an excellent copy of a Beretta that
 I enjoyed using when I lived in the Philippines Hmmmm

And thats the HARD stuff to copy

 

Youre like a bunch of overeducated New York jewish ACLU lawyers
fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in
Arkansas  Holly Silva
