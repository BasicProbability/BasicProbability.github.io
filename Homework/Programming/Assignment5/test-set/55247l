What I find so hard to understand is how come some people apparantly
NOT connected with government or otherwise privileged will
go to great lengths redefinitions reinterpretations in a fullbore
attempt to THROW AWAY THE PROTECTION OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS under the
Constitution
Almost makes me think of lemmings running into the sea during a lemming
year
I really wonder that Jefferson and Madison would say to these folks

Theyd probably quote Montesque sp who was once asked if Russia
was likely to become a democracy any time soon No because
Russia is a nation of slaves and the people get what they deserve
Since he said that Russia has changed a great deal But so 
unfortunately have other nations
