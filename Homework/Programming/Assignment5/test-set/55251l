Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco It is hard to
understand all this angst What happend there is nothing less than
what we wanted to happen Why all the sour grapes 
 
       Cute word angst  Conveys volumes
 
       Id be interested in this particular definition of we  Its
such a fluid pronoun
 
BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending
budget cuts  the attendance of the press at the initial big
commando raid is proof It would have been ever so easier to grab
Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco Alas no
propaganda value there

The FBI screwedup big time all the time They should have never allowed
the situation to drag out like that A quick second assault before the
BDs could decide on a strategy would have been the better plan

The BDs themselves were the biggest screwups though They imagined
that US law and US lawenforcement had no jurisdiction within their
little country WRONG 
 
       The BD were a paranoid little cult out in the middle of nowhere
which all of a sudden had their worst paranoid fears reinforced
 
       Joy
 
They had no right whatsoever to fire on
the BATF and if they mistook their identity initially they should
have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were
 
       Yes they probably should have although how many paranoid
nuts can say they held off the feds for 51 days
 
If the
BDs had a problem with the warrants they take it to court just like
the rest of us If they wanted fullauto weapons they could have
obtained the proper permits just like the rest of us would need to
do What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies
to themselves and which does not They get their chance like the rest
of us  at the voting booth
 
        The voting booth is highly overrated  People need to get up
off their lazy butts more than every year or every two years  Hell
most dont even do that
 
If the BATF and FBI have become latterday Gestapo then they have
become that way because WE have desired them to be so
 
        No because we have decided that it doesnt make enough
difference to us to get up and do something  Thats something
for instance a lot of people who go speak against gun control
bills at their local government  Dozens of progun speakers
show up and few if any antis do but  they often win anyway
 
        Why  Because it doesnt matter who shows up it matters
whos willing to scream afterwards  And it isnt that most people
give a damn one way of the other but that they dont  Nobody
gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds
 
We get to
vote on laws and on the lawmakers By our choices over the years
we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI When
the FBI was out chasing pinkos the general public didnt seem
to mind a bit of extraconstitutional activity
 
       The general publics usually not even read the constitution
And what they have learned is a distorted picture of the whole thing
