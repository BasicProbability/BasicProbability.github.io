   Ive yet to meet a group of Baptists who were stockpiling Cambells soup
   and M16sAR15s and bangingmarrying thirteen yuear olds 
  
  I dont recall saying Baptists do any of that  Though I suppose some do   
And  
  none of them are listed in the dictionary as characteristics of a cult  My  
  mother stockpiled Campbells soup when it was on sale  
  
   Youre a sorry
   son of a bitch if you cant draw a distinction between these two things
  
  You are an intolerent foulmouthed human  You sound like you are ready to  
  join the KKK or neonazis with a narrow mind like yours
 
 Fuck YOU My paternal grandparents died in Oswiecym Aushwitz in the native
 tongue for all of you pseudohistorically literate people 

And Bejing  Peking who cares about native tongue as long as we all  
understand each other

 I would
 suggest youd have to search long and hard to find someone with more
 diffuse sensibilities 

Oh not more than a few feet I wouldnt think  Im sorry IF your paternal  
grandparents died in Oswiecym or Aushwitz which is easier to say than prove  
but if so the lesson they paid thier lives for was wasted on you

 Just tootin my own horn

You are the expert  I often feel compelled to brag about the circumstances of  
my grandparents death  8

 
   People like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
   who arent deserved of it Get a life and chill on the paranoia
   
 
 I dont care about cults Theres no language problem here My problem is
 with religious fanatics claiming to be God is just a little bit
 unsettling stockpiling several years supply of canned foods and enough
 weapons to hold off a company not to mention the ATF which ed up in
 the first place and talking about how theyre going to take care of all
 of the unbelievers But granted up to that moment hed done nothing
 wrong I recognize and respect that
 
 Then the ATF discovers he doesnt have proper permits for some of his
 purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them 
 

A BATF offense if true

 Then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child
 abuse be refiled There have been interviews with some parents whose
 children were in the compound at some point These parents claimed
 psychological and sexual abuse The childrens statements supported these
 charges

A LOCAL offense if true  Totally outside the BATFs domain

 
 Was it a noknock I really havent heard anything on that But clearly
 he was not just another guy minding his own business Hell give them all
 the guns in the world if they dont bother anyone But he was a scary sort
 dont you think 

I didnt know the man  Just what the TV chose to tell me

 The sort of person youd want your daughter to date 

I thought there were prejudicial undertones here  I would trust my daughters  
judgement

 I
 didnt think so Reason number one to doubt the legal statements made by
 some of the survivors Note that some of them were made by his guard
 wellhesitate to say expertly trained killers

I dont believe either side blindly
 
 Then he fired on the ATF Thats not just a little mistake or some
 redwhiteand blue American defending his home against Big Brother 

IF they fired first without announcing in a beleivable way who they were  I  
can pound on your door and claim to be the police will you just lay down and  
take it if I do then he could be justified in firing on the ATF in  
selfdefense

 That
 shit doesnt fly Anyone with his background that will shoot and kill
 Federal Law Enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade
 enjoys our support Hes a loose cannon Just my opinion

His background  What law has he been convicted of breaking in the past
