Subject CNN tape shows tank starting fire

A friend recorded CNN news during the gassing and incineration of
the BDs  I went through it carefully today and found something
very interesting  A tank is pulling out of the house and there
is a fireball maybe 24 across that lasts for about 1 second
Exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later the smoke starts
billowing out of that area of the building
Now Im no govt spokestwinkie so it might really have been a
weather balloon or something  Perhaps someone would check it out
and comment
