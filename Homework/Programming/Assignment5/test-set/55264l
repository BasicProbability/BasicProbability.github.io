Subject Re Civil Rights Violations

 Eighth Amendment
 1 The Davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when
 	f Thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a  
hearing

Happens all the time they were arraigned the next day Id doubt
youd have any luck on this point


	I had heard that not all were arraigned yet some were being
	held as material witnesses
