Subject Bennett  Banned Bayonet 



I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America  the organization
which claims to be championing conservative issues esp in the wake 
of the Republican defeat last fall 

Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of 
support among conservatives for some individuals in prep for 96 run

Youd be close to the truth

Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett former Drug Czar who heartily
supported Bushs semiauto import ban and wondered if it went far enough  
who helped put the big lie about sporting use into the publics eye  and
Jack Kemp  who recently came out in support of semiauto bans 

These are conservatives  

Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfects spell check
against my letter  it came up with the following corrections for Bennett 

1 Banned
2 Bayonet


Needless to say I found these choices rather amusing



It collectivism vs individualism is an ancient conflict Men have come
close to the truth but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell
after another Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy The
savages whole existence is public ruled by the laws of his tribe
Civilization is the process of setting man free from men

I dont speak for my company We hire the Politically Correct to do that
