Everyone discussing why the BATF did this or didnt do that is missing
the point BATF wanted to destroy Koresh  Everything they did was
consistent with that objective

    And having done that theyve declared victory by flying their flag
    over the ruins Regardless of who started the firefight or fire
    I see the flag as nothing but arrogant


        Not only arrogant but in plain bad taste  As though they had
        defeated a difficult foe and done so with honor

        I understand Reno does not own the BATF doesnt Bentsen a
        Texas boy at that I believe  Why is not Bentsen from Treasury
        as much out front as Reno is  Is he hiding behind her apron strings
 
 
       The BATF got sat on pretty early on  After the initial shooting
was over it pretty much become the FBIs show  Even that BATF guy
stopped showing up next to the speaker at the daily press conferences
