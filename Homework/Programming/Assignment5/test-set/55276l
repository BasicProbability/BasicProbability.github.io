This is my first time on the network but I am very concerned with this
incident in Waco  I will refrain from stating my opinions until after I have
read the FAQ  Could someone tell me how to get this  I must say that I
believe the Govt was wrong in the actions that they took in this situation
 
        As far as I know there is no FAQ for tpg  Somebody was working
on one but I think it died in committee
