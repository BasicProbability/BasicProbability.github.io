I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation with full prosecuting and
subpoena powers  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found
Fat chance I bet  I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal
investigation which will turn up at most poor judgement

  OOOHHHHHHHH can you say INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR geee maybe ol
Mr Walsh can do something useful after all

 Right fat chance


Im responding at the risk of misreading your response but I do have to tell 
my fellow conservatives to give it up attacking RenoClintonATFFBI

They may have botched an operation but they didnt kill anybody who never shot
at them first  David Koresh was a frigging lunatic  His followers had the 
combined IQ of a Geraldo audience  The kids probably would have been those
fucked up social rejects who go to Freshman dances in high school never to be
seen again except maybe in the band until prom when they show up like 
animals boarding the ark  Then its bowling till 3 in the morning 
WHYWHY did it happen to me

Anyway the point is Janet RenoBill Clinton were only following the advice of 
trained law enforcement officials who were experts in their fields  Id 
rather have our leaders do that then micromanage every crisis that comes 
along  Then youd really see trouble no matter what party or ideology the 
President and her er I mean his Attorney General is
