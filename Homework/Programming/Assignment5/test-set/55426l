Subject Re Waco Shootout Highlights Total Irresponsibility of the

Im not sure were this thread has been before i popped in but Ive never
thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or
competence I just cant imagin any valid reason for having a gun that
cant wait a few days I can think of plenty of bad reasons for not
wanting a waiting period I want to buy a gun and kill soandso right
now Ive crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and I cant
afford to spend the night here etc

Im not a big fan of guns but I feel that it is important to guard
Americans rights to own them On the other hand we license and regulate
many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights
