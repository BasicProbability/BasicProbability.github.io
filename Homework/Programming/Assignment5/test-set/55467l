The reason the fire department couldnt fight the fire is that bullets were
whizzing throughout the area  Had koresh not had such a frightenly large
arsenal maybe the feds would not have decided that having the firedepartment
on the scene would have been a useless waste of taxes and potentially
dangerous had a different fire broken out in Waco

So how come the fire department had been at the compound area for
49 days only to be sent away two days before the FBI attack

Whatever the above comment has to do with the hazards of fighting a
fire in the midst of ammo cooking off
Maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about
being diverted from their other duties and the FBI said FIne Go home
and well call you if we need you  A million things could have happened
we dont know

BTW this is the first time I have heard that the Waco FD was on scene
for all but the last 2 days  whats the source out of curiosity
