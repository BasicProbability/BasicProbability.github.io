Subject Re ATF BURNS DIVIDIAN RANCH NO SURVIVORS

As quoted from nate1504735838830psygatepsychindianaedu by natepsygatepsychindianaedu Nathan Engle

 What did those people do wrong in the first place that is what i cant 
 figure out 
 
     They assembled a frightening arsenal of weapons by circumventing laws 
 which were intended to prevent such a buildup Then later they used some 
 of those weapons to kill representatives of the Federal government Im 
 sure they were frightened when they saw all those BATF officers closing 
 in but in retrospect I cant see how their subsequent gunfight could be 
 expected to improve the situation
 
What laws did they circumvent  Being frightening isnt a crime  Some people
are afraid of young Black males  That doesnt make the mere status of being a
young Black male a crime

The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades  There is no
evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement 
personnel  Under those circumstances other persons have been found to be
acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified
armed intruders

     At this point I place little or no credibility on any of the charges 
 of child abuse or molestation but I would remind you that the Branch 
 Davidians arent the only ones burying their dead
 
The charges are irrlevant anyway since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction
in such matters anyway  Of course that hasnt stopped them from making other
such spurious charges such as the existence of mythical meth labs  Of
course they whole cult thing indicates the level of contempt that they have
for the 1st amendment

 sure they were crazy no dought about it but what did they do wrong 
 
     They attempted to stage an armed resistance to federal authorities 
 under conditions that placed dozens of unarmed and innocent people in the 
 line of fire 
 
That armed resistance at least initially may well have been LEGAL

 

Youre like a bunch of overeducated New York jewish ACLU lawyers
fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in
Arkansas  Holly Silva
