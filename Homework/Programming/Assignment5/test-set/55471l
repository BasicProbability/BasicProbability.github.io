Subject Re HB 1776 passes the Texas House


In a previous article dlb5404tamutstamuedu Daryl Biberdorf says


From memory todays Houston Chronicle 27 April 1993 reported that
HB 1776 PASSED in the Texas House of Representatives with approximately
this is from memory 95 votes for and 45 votes against

What does this bill do

However in an effort to go into CYA thats cover your ass mode
they wrote the bill in such a way as to make the law subject to a
statewide referendum in November  However the paper reported that
this is actually unconstitutional under the Texas Constitution which
only allows referendums for constitutional amendments not for plain
old laws

If the court does not permit the referendum the bill will probably
go into effect with little fanfare

All of the above is subject to the Texas Senates voting for
the bill as well  Time to start calling the state senators now
