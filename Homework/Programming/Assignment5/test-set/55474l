 The press is against you the public the voting public is against
 you the flow of history is against you  this is it 

Kind of sounds like Plessy v Ferguson huh  Of course as in that case
things change huh

 Too fucking bad You have gone the way of the KKK Violent solutions
 are passe Avoid situations which encourage criminals Then you will
 be as safe as possible Such as it is 
 
No if your little fantasy comes to pass the country will have gone
TOWARD the KKK  Youre of course being a little disengenuous  Violent
solutions are never passe FOR THE GOVERNMENT and CRIMINALS who frequently
cannot be distinguished

Avoid situations which encourage criminals  You mean dont be a woman
Dont be Black  Dont be gay  Im quite certain that having a surfeit of
unarmed victims will discourage your beloved KKK from engaging in violent
solutions


 

Youre like a bunch of overeducated New York jewish ACLU lawyers
fighting to eliminate school prayer from the public schools in
Arkansas  Holly Silva
