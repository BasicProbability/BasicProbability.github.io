The primary purpose of fertilizer is not to explode or kill
people  Maybe just a law saying you cannot use this stuff
to make a bomb would be good

  Even better lets pass a law making it illegal to kill people
with bombs of any sort

PS Thanks for explaining the primary purpose of fertilizer  
Now I can stop worrying about the World Trade Towers bombing
