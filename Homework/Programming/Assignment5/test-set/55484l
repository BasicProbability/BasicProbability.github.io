  Firearms are the fifthleading cause of unintentional deaths among children
 ages 14 and under

From the rkba archive rkba004

   Total firearm deaths for children 1 through 14 at 587 1988 is
    one of the SMALLEST causes of deaths in children Cars falls
    burns drowning food ingestion are all much larger cause of
    deaths 7988

So firearms are the 6th leading cause after drowning and choking on
food at least for 1988
 
Sorry CharlesAccording to the National Safety Council ACCIDENT FACTS1991
In 1990 gun accidents were the fifthleading cause of accidental death
for children ages 14 and under
 
 I dont understand how the ratio to other accidental
 deaths is important  So guns dont kill as many children as car accidents
 What is the difference in severity between 1000 deaths and 10000 deaths

The difference is that a rational person would address the leading
cause first and address the lesser causes later

 That thinking is so screwed up I dont even know how to respond to it
A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths and not attempt
to affect childhood falls drownings gunshot injuries etc
So this so called rational person using your definition if he or she
were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25
through 64 would only worry about cancer and would not try to decrease
LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease injuries stroke suicide liver disease
chronic lung disease homicide HIV infection or diabetes  Oh okay Charles
that makes a lot of sense  I tell you what Charles Ill call the Heart
Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational
and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES
of death  And you call your local police homicide department liver foundation
and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes
Please quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles
 
Ive got an idea Charles why dont you start a talkpoliticscaraccidents
group or talkpoliticsfall group  This is talkpoliticsguns  Dont
confuse the issue  Just because a social problem may not claim as many
victims as another we should not try to address it  I dont agree
Im not posting to tpg to debate the supposed severity of causes of
childhood deaths I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond
to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who
wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths
is trying to make a political issue out of it
 
 
 I assumed that any humane
 person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
 gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends

A humane person who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old
would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm
Ignorance is our greatest enemy

 Again Charles you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context
for your own purposes  The statement that you responded to above is actually
in reference to a previous post by another person who like you expressed
concern over making youth gun violence a priority  I guess maybe Humane
person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh Both would be defined
as a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest
number of childhood deaths  If that is the case Im extremely glad that I
am inhumane and irrational
 
  Well Joe I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
                                            
What other sources of information do you have which confirms their
data  These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts
Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report

Sorry Charles the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting
the facts  But if you insist according to the 1990 UCR Firearm murders
of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990
 
Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you  They state
that Every day 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun
accidents suicides and homicides  Many more are wounded
 
Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry  They say Gunshot
wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas
between 1987 and 1990
 
Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles  They state
that Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300 from
1986 to 1988
 
Charles I hope you dont need to be convinced that youth are increasingly
victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns  If you dont
realize this fact I dont care if you go by CDC or FBI data or if you go
into the homes schools and streets where these kids are and take a poll
by yourself Im not going to bother to try to convince you  Its obvious
that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion
and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political
discussion  I really dont want to do that
 
 or the Centers for Disease Control
         
They have firearm statistics  Are firearms a disease

 Charles its obvious that you know nothing about the CDC
They dont just study cancer and heart disease  Ive got news for you
interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic  In 1984 Surgeon General
C Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health
problem as cancer heart disease or auto accidents
 
 that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths

In the lives of youths or in their schools  I know a number of
youths who have firearms present in their lives  Is is quite
appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms this is a
presence right  What are you trying to say  This innuendo
reminds me of listening to Bill Clinton
 
WHO THE FK SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE
FIREARM CHARLES In the future if you are going to post to tpg and jump
into a previous discussion please read the entire posting not just 1
sentence that you decide to respond to What the hell are you saying here
Youre wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control
issue out of a discussion that isnt

 The CPHV reports that 135000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that
 400000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year

I wouldnt trust their statistics without independent verification

 The CDC estimates
 that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
 in 1990

Based on CPHV statistics  Based on UCR  Based on what

 The CDC also says that 12 million elementaryaged latchkey
 children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access
 to guns in their home

Therefore  What is the purpose of this claim

Charles buddy Im getting really tired of this  Do you live on the planet
Mars  As a physicist I realize that you probably dont come into contact
with many youth but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local
urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools  In addition
spend a few minutes talking to these kids  Ask them if they have ever heard
gunshots in their neighborhoods whether they know anyone who has been shot
whether they know anyone who has a gun whether they have ever held a gun and
whether they themselves have ever been shot
 
Believe me Charles THAT will be your INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION
