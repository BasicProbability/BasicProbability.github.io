     They did they used CS that would NOT harm children

i REALLY hope youre being sarcastic here but ive seen so many
stupid things said in complete seriousness that its hard to tell
without a smiley

do you actually believe theres a CS gas that can discriminate based
on the age of the target

Yes the gas used was a mild concentration or formulation compared to
the heavy duty stuff

You know this for a fact How do you know Or are you just making
things up for flamebait

The FBI has claimed from the begining that it wasnt standard use
tear gas How do you know it was Or do you just assume it was
for flamebait
