Subject Re Rewording the Second Amendment ideas

A wellregulated militia being necessary to the security of the FREE State
the right of the people to KEEP and BEAR arms shall not be infringed

I know that as a Canadian I dont have much to stand on

But I think that the right to KEEP and BEAR arms is very important to
maintaining a FREE society The America is still the most enviable
place to live on this Earth by anyone with their head on straight
and will stay that way only if more people standup PUBLICLY for what
they believe

Remember that if you stand for nothing Youll fall for anything
including wellmeaning socialists they did in Canada
