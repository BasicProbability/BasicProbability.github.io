Im not sure were this thread has been before i popped in but Ive never
thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or
competence I just cant imagin any valid reason for having a gun that
cant wait a few days

You cant think of any valid reason to own a gun that cant wait

Either you have a very limited imagination or a strange definition of
the word valid

Here are a few reasons you might want a gun right now

Youre a Korean greengrocer in LA and a riot has just started in a
nearby neighborhood

Youve received a death threat

Your SO has just broken your arm and you fear for your life if you
stay with him and hes said hell kill you if you leave him

A psychopath is breaking into peoples houses in your neighborhood and
robbing and killing people inside

A violent mugger is operating on the route you have to take to get to
your night job

There are lots of dangers you might be in that wont wait for the
waiting period for you to purchase a gun
