 	They did they used CS that would NOT harm children

i REALLY hope youre being sarcastic here but ive seen so many 
stupid things said in complete seriousness that its hard to tell 
without a smiley

do you actually believe theres a CS gas that can discriminate based
on the age of the target

Yes the gas used was a mild concentration or formulation compared to
the heavy duty stuff

      I heard it was delivered in high concentration to counteract the
      wind at 30 mph blowing it away  What is your source for the
      quoted low concentration
