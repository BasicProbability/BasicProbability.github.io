GT Hi We are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull

You could do high resolution CT computed tomographic scanning of
the skull  Many CT scanners have an algorithm to do 3D
reconstructions in any plane you want  If you did reconstructions
every 2 degrees or so in all planes you could use the resultant
images to create usercontrolled animation
