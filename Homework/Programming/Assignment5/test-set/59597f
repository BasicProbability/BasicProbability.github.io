 As a selfproclaimed atheist my position is that I believe that 
 there is no god  I dont claim to have any proof  I interpret
 the agnostic position as having no beliefs about gods existence

Thats fine  These words have multiple meanings

As a selfproclaimed atheist I believe that some conceptions
of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact and I lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these  I usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable  Note that this is a
positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a
god I do not believe in a god but I also do not believe the
agnostic claim
