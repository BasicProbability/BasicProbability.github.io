Subject Q Repelling wasps

This is a cross post to recgardens and scimed Set the followup
line in the header depending on what kind of advice you give or
email directly to me cecilysatorliuse

I have a problem with wasps  they seem to love me Last summer I
couldnt spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me I am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps

   This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds The caretaker poor fellow will have to take care
of them and that will give me a head start on them Last year we
couldnt find any nest Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of 30 square meter other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory Is there anything I can grow rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards
Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else

   Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath The wasps seem
to come to drink at them and I suppose that their prey will breed in
them The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps because as soon
as the wasp season starts they stop coming to have their bath

Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 1520 wasps they
seem to love me The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about
wasps is to stand still and not wave my arms Ive got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice I have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes to no avail They still love me
and come for me even when Im in the middle of a crowd So far only
two things seem to work To kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows 

NB I dont have a problem with bees or bumblebees just wasps
