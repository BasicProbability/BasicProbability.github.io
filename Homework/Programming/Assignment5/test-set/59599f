I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium

I have a 10 year old son that lives with my exwife  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin Tofranil and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion  I would like to
know whatever is important that I should know  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like proscons regarding Lithium therapy

I have a booklet from the Lithium Information Center based at the
University of Wisconsin but feel that it is prolithium and would be
interested in comments from the not necessarily PRO side of the fence

I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed

I get antsy about posts like this Is the concern more for son or about exw
ife The standard impartial procedure is to ask for a second opinion
about sons condition
Then too is son acting out games between divorced parents
