Someone writes
I have a 10 year old son that lives with my exwife  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin Tofranil and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion  I would like to
know whatever is important that I should know  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like proscons regarding Lithium therapy

I get antsy about posts like this Is the concern more for son or about exw
ife The standard impartial procedure is to ask for a second opinion
about sons condition
Then too is son acting out games between divorced parents

Precisely  One wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing difficulty with his behavior  Standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist  One would want to
rule out the possibility that the bad behavior is not psychiatric
illness at all
