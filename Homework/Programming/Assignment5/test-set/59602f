 Not everything that goes in comes out and personaly I dont mind giving
 my body a hand once in a while
 
 Just my experience

 Ive got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery
 and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme  Ordinary massage
 is intended to make a person feel better especially if they have muscular
 or joint problems  But  like chiropracty  there are some practitioners
 who take the technique to a far extreme invoking what seems to me to be
 quack science to justify their technique
 
 In the case of massage there is a technique called deep abdominal massage
 in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines
 The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
 intestines and putrifies releasing poisons which cause various disease
 syndromes  By this vigorous and painful procedure it is alleged that
 these deposits can be loosened up and passed out
 
 I just cant believe this idea has any truth behind it  The human intestine
 is not a New York City sewer pipe  And even if it were you eat half of
 a small box of Triscuits and there aint gonna be nothin sticking to the
 inner surface of your intestine  

Mark this is the most reasonable post that Ive seen in Sci Med on the 
topic of Colonic Flushing  Im in a profession that uses manipulationa 
very refined form of massage to treat various human diseases  Proving 
that manipulation works has been extremely difficultas the MDs delight in 
pointing out  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better 
progress than the chiropractors in provingscientifically that their 
techingues work  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation 
to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or 
better than drug treatmentusing physiological measurements and not just 
the womans preception of improvement  This study was hailed by the JAOA 
editors as the turning point in the professions long struggle to prove 
itself to the medical community

Im currently trying to get the AOAAmerican Osteopathic Association which 
has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the US to also support 
nutrition education and research  Ive pointed out in a grant proposal 
that the founder of Osteopathic MedicineAT Still embraced both diet and 
manipulation to set himself apart from the MDs of his time who were pushing 
only drugsStill was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs 
during his service in the Civil War  He decided that there had to be a 
better way to treat human disease since he saw the curedrugs as being 
worse than the disease  Through his many years of study of the human body 
he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his 
students in the USs first Osteopathic Medical school  We now have 17
Still used manipulation to treatand also diagnose human disease but he 
used diet to prevent human disease  Im trying to get the Osteopathic 
Profession to return to its roots and beat the MDs to the punchso to 
speak  Both DOs and MDs in current medical practice have very little 
understanding of how diet affects human health  This has to change
