I have just started taking allergy shots a month ago and is 
still wondering what I am getting into A friend of mine told
me that the body change every 7 years whatever that means
and I dont need those antibodybuilding allergy shots at all
Does that make sense to anyone

BTW can someone summarize what is in the Consumer Report
February 1988 article

I am reluctant to summarize it for then you will have my opinion of what the
article says rather than your own opinion  I think it is important enough
for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article  The
title is The shot doctors and it appears on Pages 96100 of the February
1988 issue of Consumer Reports  The following excerpt from the article may
entice you to read the whole article
     Too often shots are overusedWhen you put a patient on
     shots youve got an annuity for life a former president of
     the American Academy of Allergy and Immunology told CU page 97
