Partial deletion

potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis  If I recall
correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves Nhydroxylation to Nacetylbenzoquinoneimine which
is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione  When hepatic
glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay 24 days between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage  This is NOT a nice way to die

Nice explanation except that it isnt Nhydroxylation that causes the
formation of the Nacetylpbenzoquinone imine NAPQI but rather a
direct twoelectron oxidation In addition there is one school of thought
that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein
is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen  

As far as drug toxicities go acetaminophen has and continues to be one
of the most intensely scrutinized An excellent recent review of the topic
can be found in 

	Vermeulen Bessems and Van de Straat 	
	Molecular Aspects of Paracetamolinduced hepatotoxicity and its
	MechanismBased Prevention Drug Metabolism Reviews 243 367
	407 1992

	Acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in Europe

I couldnt agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic
dose of acetaminophen causes  Ive heard a number of descriptions by
physicians associated with poison control centers and they describe a
lingering very painful death
