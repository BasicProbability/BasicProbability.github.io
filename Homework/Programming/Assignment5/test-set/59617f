 The Prozac gave very bad anxietyjitters and insomina it was impossible to 
 sit still for more than a minute or so

I tried Prozac a few months ago and had some insomnia from it but no
anxiety or jitters  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
Prozac had done any good but it only provided a tiny benefit  Maybe
because the person who prescribed it didnt know much and gave up after a
20mg dose didnt work

Now Im seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like Prozac  One pillday 50mg seemed to help some 
Now Im trying 100mgday  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
Prozac  I think my doctor said that only 4 of the people taking Zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects  The only problem Im
having is some minor GI distress but nothing too annoying  Hopefully the
Zoloft will work  Maybe your friend should try this one next

My psychiatrists strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs usually Prozac  If that works great  If it works but has too many
side effects try Zoloft or maybe Paxil  If the serotonin drugs dont work
at all try one of the tricyclics like desipramine

suggestions as to the next step

Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs dont have much
experience in this area and from what Ive seen Im inclined to believe
him  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my
family practitioners office

Disclaimer Im not a doctor what I know about this comes from talking to
my psychiatrist and reading scimed
