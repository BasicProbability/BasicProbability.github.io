Subject Is this a total or partial scam


Theres a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping
mall offering free examinations  Part of the process involves a
multiplejointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer
sounding voice digitize left PSIS digitize right PSIS digitize
C7 please stand with spine in neutral position  Im wondering
whether this doesnt really measure anything and the computer voice
is to impress the victims or whether it is measuring something
that chiropractors think is useful to measure
