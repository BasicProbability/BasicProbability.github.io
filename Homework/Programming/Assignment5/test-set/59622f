Subject IS THIS A SCAM

    Jim Haynes wants to know the following is a scam

       Theres a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping
       mall offering free examinations  Part of the process involves a
       multiplejointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer
       sounding voice digitize left PSIS digitize right PSIS digitize
       C7 please stand with spine in neutral position  Im wondering
       whether this doesnt really measure anything and the computer voice
       is to impress the victims or whether it is measuring something
       that chiropractors think is useful to measure

Earth to scimedIf it looks like a duckand quacks like a duck

This is a TOTAL scam Since the beginning of chiropraxis the chiropractor has 
tried to sell The Subluxation as The Problem and then sell themselves and
their Adjustments as The Solution The Chiropractic Subluxation is a delusional 
diagnosis and the Adjustments of Subluxations by extension constitute a 
delusional medicine

The wide spectrum of chiropractic Techniques ALL have their own methods for 
detecting Spinal Demons and unique methodolgies for Excorcizing Them The 
computer approach is an attempt to sell with science but this device is 
nothing more than a hightech Subluxation Detectorand in the end
AMAZINGLYit will show the potential patient to suffer fromVS
Vertebral SubluxationThe Silent Killer
