  Does anyone know of any studies done on the longterm health effects of a
  mans vasectomy on his female partner
  
  
 Ive heard of NO studies but speculation

 Why on earth would there be any effect on womens health  Thats about 
 the most absurd idea Ive heard since Ted Kaldiss claim that no more than 
 35000 people would march on Washington

 Ok one point  Greatly reduced chance of pregnancy  But thats it

Well there might be another Since Im sterile my wife can enjoy sex 
without fear of getting pregnant
