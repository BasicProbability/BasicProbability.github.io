Subject Re Antihistamine for sleep aid

 But after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights doesnt it start
 to have a paradoxical effect  I used to take one every night for
 allergies and couldnt figure out why I developed bad insomnia  

Insomnia is a known but relatively infrequent sideeffect of
diphenhydramine  

For most people this does not occur  On the other hand most people
can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use
Allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to
another to avoid this
