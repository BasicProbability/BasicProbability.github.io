 1  Does it cause the body any harm if one picks ones nose  For example
 might it lead to a loss of ability to smell

It may be a good way to catch a cold  Its easy to pick up cold
viruses on your fingers either from touching a contaminated surface
or by shaking hands with someone that has a cold  Then putting your
fingers in your nose will transfer the viruses to your nose
