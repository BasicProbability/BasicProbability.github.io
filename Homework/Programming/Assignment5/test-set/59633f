Moss is People Against Cancers Director of Communications People
Against Cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information not
exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to

And where do you advise people to turn for cancer information


 Most
maybe all of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern
treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer and
many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well

It seems to me youve offered a circular refutation of Mosss organization Who
has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable Could
it be those regulatory agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing
to be operating with major vested interests Whether one believes that these
vested interests are real or not or whether or not they actually shape medical
research is a seperate argument If one sees a possibility however that these
interests exist then the fact that some of the information put out by PAC
has been refuted by the medical industry doesnt hold much weight

As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons the fact that the NIH didnt
find them effective doesnt make much sense here Of course they didnt I
tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon They are fighting
like hell to keep that clinic open and they credit his treatment with their
survival Anyone who looks at the NIHs record for investigation of alterna
tive cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find
ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless
