Subject Re Nose Picking

stephenmontcsmissouriedu Stephen MontgomerySmith writes
 1  Does it cause the body any harm if one picks ones nose  For example
 might it lead to a loss of ability to smell
 
 2  Is it harmful for one to eat ones nose pickings

Ive seen children do this and wondered about something  If the
mucus in ones nose collects filters particles going into the
airway if a child then picks and ingests this material might
it have a vaccinatory effect since if the body ingests airborne
diseases or other stuff on the mucus the body might generate
antibodies for this small invasion

Maybe this is why some children dont get sick very often
