Our 20month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care  He was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4  I know kids in day care fall sick more often but we


Sounds pretty familiar  I posted similar cries about last September when
Caroline just entered daycare  She was two then and have been with 
continuous colds since until last March  As spring approaches her colds
slowed down  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds
Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she
had antibiotics  The other time was due to sinus infection and I wished
that I did not give her that awful Septra 

Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions

There are the net studies  that is if you read this newsgroup often
there will be a round of questions like this every month  There might
be formal studies like that but bear with my not so academic experience
Okay

 How often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick
How often do they get colds flus ear infections 

Gee I bet 5050 youll hear cases in all these catagories

 Is there any data on home care vs day care

I am pretty sure an insulated child at home sicks less  But that child 
still will face the world one day 


 Does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later

Thats what I believe and comfort myself with  Caroline will get more
and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other 
kids mouth nor let other kids do the same  Cold virus mutate easily
However I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these
diseases so she would be less severely affected  Everytime she has a cold
we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp 
at night so she can have good rest thanks to some suggestions from the net
Thats about all the care she needs from us  I try very hard to keep her
off antibiotics  Twice her ped gave me choice to decide whether she would
have antibiotics  I waited just long enough 34 days to see that she
fought the illness off  I do understand that you dont have much choice if
the child is in pain andor high fever 

does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it
not have any long term effect

If the child doesnt rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime
then the child should be stronger


 Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects
 
Ill leave this to expert

 How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal and what does one do about it

If your child just entered daycare Im pretty sure the first 6 months will be
the hardest  Then you get more used to it  Boy do I hate to see me typing
this sentence  I recall when I read something like this last September I said 
to myself oh sure  But I do get used to it now  However I do hear 
people say that it does get better after a year or two  I am looking forward 
to a healthier next winter  As it gets warmer I hope you do get some break 
soon

 Is there any way to build immunity and resistance

Eat well sleep well  Try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary

Good luck
