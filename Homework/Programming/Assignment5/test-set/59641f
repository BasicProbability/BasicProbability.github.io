Subject Re HELP for Kidney Stones 



In a previous article jeffssrhpcom Jeff Silva says
 I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth Yes
by a male doctor so Im sure some of you women will disagree Id
really like to know the truth in this so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in 



Ive had three children and the pain was different in degree for each  I
think it just depends  I was impressed by how awful a kidney stone seemed
to be when I saw a relative with one  I bet they depend toosome are
probably worse than others
