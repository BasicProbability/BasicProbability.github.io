Subject arthritis and diabetes




I have osteoarthritis and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
type II I guessno insulin 


Ive been trying to read up on these two conditions and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known 
Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis at least for women with arthritis but of course the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain 

For myself Im almost afraid to lose weight because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet I use the last one was 18002000 calories in about
eight small meals the weight wont go off gradually and stay off 
Instead it drops off precipitously and then comes back on with much
interest like bread on the waters


With this experience its hard to be encouraging to my husband  All I can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible

Meanwhile some experts recommend no sugar others no fat others just a
balanced diet  Its almost impossible to tell from their writings which
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty

Is it my imagination or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood  Is it just that Im used to pediatriciantalk Its strep
give him this and hell get well and so my expectations are too high
