Subject Re Gateway Monitor ProblemAgain Help


Im afriad thats not true  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever
the 15 Mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode  Im running OS2 at 1024 and
the same symptoms appear

It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and
the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems two VERY  different cards
