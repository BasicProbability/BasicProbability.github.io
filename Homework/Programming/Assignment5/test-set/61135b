Subject Re SCSI or IDE The Bottom Line

 Which would YOU choose and why

I have both

I have IDE only on my DROS box and IDE and SCSI on my Unix box

IDE on the DROS box cos it only has a hard disk SCSI on my Unix box cos it
has a SCSI hard disk CDROM and tape

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up

Faster drives are also available for SCSI  I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy
does have a 9ms average seek time IE it finds data 25 faster than my 12ms
Toshiba drive

 
 Like lots of people Id really like to increase my data transfer rate from
 the hard drive  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive Seagate 1239A and
 a standard IDE controller card on my ISA 48650

I dont think that SCSI will increase your data transfer much on an ISA bus 

 
 Im currently thinking about adding another HD in the 300Mb to 500Mb range
 And Im thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive SCSI for the future benefit
 I believe Im getting something like 890Kbsec transfer right now according
 to NU

890KBs is pretty good

 
 How would this number compare if I bought the stateoftheart SCSI card for
 my ISA PC and the stateoftheart SCSI hard drive the best system I could
 hope for

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the SAME mechanicals as many state of the
art IDE drives Only the interface electronis differ  look at the 520MB Fijitsu
drive for an example

 
 Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other but what would
 YOU want to use on your ISA system And how much would it cost

I use an Adaptec 1542B on my Unix box and noname IDE cards on both

 
 Along those lines what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HDs if I
 were to buy the topoftheline IDE caching controller for my 200Mb 15ms HD
 And how much would it cost

Caching controller Why What does it give you that smartdrive  for DOS  does 
not About 30KB extra lower memory Thats about it

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 85MBs Thats
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain


 
 Thanks for any comments
