 Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
 popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not 
 faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications  Plus a 50MHz 
 motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
 chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is 
 buying the DX2 66  Many adds dont even mention the DX 50
 
  Thanks a lot

 Yes its realy simple no one makes a mother board that runs the
 bus at more than 33MHZSam

Which bus

I think there are several reasons 

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache  1215ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good fast L2 cache a DX266 is going be be faster than a DX50

What do I have

A DX50 of course

  
 GoshI think I just installed a virusIt was called MS DOS6
