 I actually have a PAS16 and could what a waste I guess it would be hook
 up a SCSI HD through its SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kbsec
 Actually I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now and
 own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS16 SCSI port  Is this SCSI port a
 SCSI2 port  How could I tell  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI2  Are all SCSI
 HDs SCSI2

Does any one know what the PAS16 SCSI port is I counted the pins on the board
displayed in their ad and it only got 40 What happened to the other 50

Did they junk a whole bunch of grounds or what

 
 Thanks for any comments
