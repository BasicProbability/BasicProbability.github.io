 Perhaps this is a silly question but here goes
 
 What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external and the
 Sportster 14400 external I see that the price of a Sportster has dramatically
 dropped to below 200 but the price of the Courier remains above 400
 
 Anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a Courier
 
 Id really appreciate your comments before I decide on which one I buy
 
 Thanks in advance and thanks again to those that replies to US Robotics info
 wanted

1  The courier looks a lot cooler 
2  The courier is upgradable to VFast You have to give USR more money for that tho
3  The Sportster is able to be modified to be a 168 dual standard if you want to
	void your warantee and totally piss USR off
