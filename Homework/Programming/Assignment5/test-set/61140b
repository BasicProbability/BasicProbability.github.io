 I am wanting to upgrade from a 386SX25 to a 486DX33 and are looking at a
 cheap quote from someone offering me a 486DX33 motherboard with no ram in
 it  I will probably sell my old mboard off somewhere
 Now I have 4 meg of RAM in my 386 which consists of
 
 4 x 9 module 1024KB simms running at 70 nanoseconds
                               
 Would I encounter problems with the pointed out areas by throwing these from
 one computer to the other

There should be no problem with this  just remember to get the number of
wait states correct
