  If youre considering buying a system with a view to using
  it to run Unix Linux bsd etc or some other special software
  there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards
  This is due to Diamonds propriety attitude to its hardware
  its impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
  specifically their dotclocks without paying and signing nondisclosure
  agreements
 
  This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
  XWindows compatibility with these cards as diamond didnt want to 
  divulge programming neccessities

I dont think the two main free X systems  XS3 and XFree86  are part
of the FSF as such

 
 Considering the above and some postings about Diamonds bad attitute
 towars customers I ordered and ActixGE VLB 2M card It will arive
 these days

Does anyone know of an email address for Diamond to which Penio could
forward his purchase information
