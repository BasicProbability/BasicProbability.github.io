 After reading many postings concerning hard drives Im still unclear
 about one thing  These new cached hard drives  is the cache on the
 drive itself or is it separate like on the controller or something
 Thanks to anyone who can clear this up

I have two SCSI hard drives each has 512KB of cache

There several reasons for this 

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted

When the drive receives data to be written the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache

May be the drive does some readadead caching as well
