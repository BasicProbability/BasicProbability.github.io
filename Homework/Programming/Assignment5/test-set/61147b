Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 35 hard drive model
LPS240A and have a concern about its behavior

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file IO it performs what I call phantom seeks

When the PC is absolutely idle I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 3040 seconds lasting 12 seconds This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card not
the drive

My other hard disk a Seagate ST3283A does not have this kind
behavior

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon
