Do all SCSI cards for DOS systems require a separate device driver to
be loaded into memory for each SCSI device hooked up

No All that Ive seen have also an onboard BIOS which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS 2 drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter Software drivers often allow for better
performance though You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks

No  The Always IN2000 among others requires no drivers for up to 7 SCSI
hard drives  DOS does not have a 2 drive maximum as I already have 3 All
is done in hardware theres no software drivers at all
