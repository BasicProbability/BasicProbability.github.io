Subject ET4000W32 chip graphics accelerator

I got a ET4000W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it The card is a VLBUS card which
can display 167 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM

It comes with ET4000W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers
The ET4000W32 drivers handles 640x480 800x600 1024x786 in 256 colours
Also in 640x480 and 800x600 it supports hicolor 32K and 64K colours

Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISAVLBUS system using
Hint chipsets

Winmark 311 from ZD lab

Using ET4000W32 drivers
640x480 256       1063 megapixelsec
        32k        734 
        64k        730
800x600 256       1007
        32k        638
        64k        635
1kx786  256        817

Using ET4000 drivers
640x480 16M        178
800x600  16colours 401     
1kx786   16        422

From the result the ET4000W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card

The price of this graphics card that I got is 185 from a local dealer
It may be less from mail order It has OS2 20 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution

From these results it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode
