Would someone be willing to explain to me the 486DX 50MHz is not more
popular than it is  I would think it would be just as fast if not
faster than the 486DX 66MHz for certian applications  Plus a 50MHz
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
chip in the future  I must be missing something since everyone is
buying the DX2 66  Many adds dont even mention the DX 50


One of the things going for the DX266 over the 50 is that its
clock speed complies with the VESA local bus spec

A couple other problems with the 486DX50

1  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic 
interference problems with 486DX50 systems  Getting an FCCB home use 
certification required additional shielding in the system

2  HEATa lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks andor cooling 
fans on their 486DX266 chips  I would guess that the 486DX50 ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter  And heat is the enemy of system 
reliability
