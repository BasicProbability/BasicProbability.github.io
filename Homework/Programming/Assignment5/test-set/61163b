 Then again maybe 2445 for the gateway system isnt too cheap
 
 I have a system from Micron computers
 
 486250 16 meg ram 245 Maxtor HD Local bus IDE  2 meg video card and
 the same 15 monitor  The system with shipping came to 2200  I sold the
 sx33 chip that came with it and bought a dx250  Total price 23002400

I think you got something wrong here  You state that the system was a
486dx250 then say that you sold the sx33 chip that came with it  This
does not make sense
