Does anyone else make low radiation emission monitors besides NEC
 
How do they compare to NECs quality and emissionwise

	I am right now working on an MPRII certified Swedish standards for
low emissions Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor  Its 1024x768 up to 72hz at
that res and it got a good writeup for image quality in a recent Feb
issue of PC Magazine  As far as I know very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality at least according to the mags  I cant tell any
difference between the two but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types  Theres VLF Very Low Frequency and ELF I think thats
Extremely Low Frequency  The MPRII standards set strict limits on both
But many comapnies NEC included according to one article I read I get a
bunch of mags so its hard for me to remember which which claim low
emissions but not specifically MPRII Compliant or MPRII Certified
only control for one usually VLF and ignore the other
	So the NEC probably has higher overall image quality I consis
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi  I like my image quality but for all I know you
may be more discerning  Good luck
