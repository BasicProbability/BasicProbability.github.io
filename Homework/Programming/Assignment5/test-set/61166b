Subject Re Low Emission Monitors  Who besides NEC

	I am right now working on an MPRII certified Swedish standards for
low emissions Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor  Its 1024x768 up to 72hz at
that res and it got a good writeup for image quality in a recent Feb
issue of PC Magazine  As far as I know very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality at least according to the mags  I cant tell any
difference between the two but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types  Theres VLF Very Low Frequency and ELF I think thats
Extremely Low Frequency  The MPRII standards set strict limits on both
But many comapnies NEC included according to one article I read I get a
bunch of mags so its hard for me to remember which which claim low
emissions but not specifically MPRII Compliant or MPRII Certified
only control for one usually VLF and ignore the other

Nanaos FSeries eg F550i and TSeries eg T660i monitors
are MPRII compliant  According to my little pamphlet the TSeries
monitors are also TCOcompliant whatever that is
