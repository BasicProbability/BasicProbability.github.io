Subject ET4000W32 3dbench

Due to the large amount of request for 3dbench of ET4000W32
I finally can get a 3dbench v10 from a ftp site

The 3dbench of ET4000W32 in my Cardex W32 card with 1MB DRAM
has superscape benchmark of 263 framessec

Hope it will satisfy people curiosity of this ET4000W32 performance
What other benchmark program result you would want to know 8
