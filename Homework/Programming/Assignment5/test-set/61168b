I have a Nanao 17 F560  on my IPX I prefer it to my Sun 16
trinitron at work with all those vertical jitters and the two
horizontal shadowmask thingies

I got it from one of the folks advertising in Computer Shopper et al
for 1050 plus about 40 shipping 

I bought a cable which goes from the Suns 13W3 connector to the
monitors 4xRGBS for about 50 from a Macintosh mailorder shop Relax
Technologies

Id do it again Happily
