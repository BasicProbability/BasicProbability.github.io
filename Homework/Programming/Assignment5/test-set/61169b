Subject Re Date is stuck

Ive posted a couple of notes about encountering this problem Based on some 
suggestions from

Mark Aitchison University of Canterbury New Zealand
	and
Chris A Larrieu cswmedu

I think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound to my 
PC speaker Im still looking at some of the other screen savers that I 
use with a randomizer but this one definately caused the loss of several 
minutes over night but not the date this time
