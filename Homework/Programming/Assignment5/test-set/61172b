Subject  What exactly is the IBM made 486SLC or SLC2 Processor 

Could someone please tell me if the 486SLC and 486SLC2 processors
IBM is putting in their Thinkpad 700s and other PCs is a REAL
486 with a math coprocessor or if it is really some Kludge that
should not be called a 486 at all

Thanks
Eric
