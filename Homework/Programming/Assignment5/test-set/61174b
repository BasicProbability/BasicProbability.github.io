speaking of CPU fans
 
                      Many use clips  make sure you use heat sink
grease or heat transfering tape or you will have wasted your money
 
Do these CPU Fans also have heat sinks  Do you recommend using both
on the same chip ie heat sink sandwiched between CPU and Fan
 
If we are just talking about a CPU Fan blowing directly on the CPU chip
I cant see how heat sink grease is necessary or even desireable

I have a PC Power and cooling fan and it is a heat sink with a built in fan 
that glues on top of the CPU  Even if the fan quits you still have the heat 
sink fins to aid cooling  The glue of course is the type that has high 
thermal conductivity
