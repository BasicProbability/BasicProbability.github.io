I have a 486 DX 33 motherboard in my pc that id like to speed up 
Id rather not replace the whole motherboard instead id like to know
if i can use a DX2 66Mhz cpu The BIOS is late model AMI circa 1991
and the system crystal is approx 663Mhz 

My question is can i just replace the original 33MHz cpu with the new
DX2 cpu If its possible will there be a need for extra cooling
devices such as heatsinks and  or muffin fans

Mike
