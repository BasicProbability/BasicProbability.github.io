Subject Space Marketing  Boycott

In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called Space Marketing
in Atlanta Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising
There was an editorial about this in the Times the following
Tuesday

Are others as upset about this as I am  I feel that a global
boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good
idea  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries
around the world  Do others agree

 Thats roughly akin to saying lets let Anaconda stripmine 
 the Grand Canyon so that stripmining can boldly go where no 
 strip mining technology has gone before  because after all 
 mining means profits and profits mean technological advance

 perity means happiness and so to hell with the Grand Canyon 

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term  on the
order of a few years before the orbit decays  Higher orbits last
longer  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental
aspects of their advertising  Freds argument is roughly akin to
saying that its bad to cut down trees so we shouldnt advertise in
newspapers  Think that through Fred

Picture this Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure
filled with biodegradable foam instead of gas  It scoops up space
debris as it orbits thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing
you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time  Because of the large
drag coefficient it will deorbit  safely burning up  within a
year

Embedded in the foam structure is a small reentry vehicle which does
not burn up during entry  It contains the electronics and propulsion
system which may be refurbished and reused as well as space science
experiments proposed and built by high school students in
advertisersponsored science fairs

Advertisers buy time on the billboard whose surface is made up of
tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package  The avionics can
reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different
parts of the globe  Clever programming allows different languages
to every country

During orbital night the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface
and small lights are revealed  The lights spell out messages for all
to see
