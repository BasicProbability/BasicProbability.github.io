I got incensed when I read that Carl Sagan called this idea an abomination 
I dont think that word means what he thinks it does Children starving in the
richest country in the world is an abomination an ad agency is at worst just
in poor taste

I dont think that idea means what you think it does Having everyone
on Earth subject to some ad agencys poor taste is an abomination
abomination  n loathing odious or degrading habit or act an
object of disgust Oxford Concise Dictionary Maybe you dont mind
having every part of your life saturated with commercials but many of
us loathe it Id rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred
by a giant billboard and Ill bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious
to an astronomer like Sagan
