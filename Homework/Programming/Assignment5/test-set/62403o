Subject No Re Space Marketing would be wonderfull

I dont think that idea means what you think it does Having everyone
on Earth subject to some ad agencys poor taste is an abomination

Well we already suffer from street hoardings  If you dont
watch TV you are free of commercials there but if you want
to go from A to B you cannot escape beer ads

us loathe it Id rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred
by a giant billboard and Ill bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious
to an astronomer like Sagan

I think the right time to stop this proposal is now

If this idea goes through its the thin end of the wedge  Soon
companies will be doing larger and more permanant billboards in the
sky  I wouldnt want a world a few decades from now when the sky
looks like Las Vegas  That would really make me sad

Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white  Well
if not this moon then a moon of Jupiter  Microscum will want to
name a galaxy Microscum Galaxy  Where do we draw the line
Historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines

Im normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource
allocation for space research I think its the most important
investment possible for mankind in the long run  But this is not
the way to get the money

        ans
