Lack of a skeleton means that muscles have to actively resist
gravity at all times on land rather than supplying only balancing
forces That means that much more energy would be required for the
creature to function The bones also supply leverage points for
pushing and lateral movement Thats why you dont find large 
active boneless creatures on land

Hydraulics can make rigid tubes  No energy required just for
support  Hydraulics also allow a creature to produce large
forces with weak muscles using the principle of a hydraulic jack
rather than a lever

This is one of those yes but things Its true that a hydraulically
pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube
but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily
though its straighton compressive strength is high and its torsional 
resistance increase is practically nil On the other grasping member 
theres no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature Tree roots 
are an example Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure
increases

Its interesting to note that on
land creatures are either two legged or 4 legged with tiny insects
having 6 or 8 legs but never 3 legged though that would be a 
stable configuration It can be argued that 2 legged creatures 

Kangaroos are 3legged  The specific number of limbs a creature has is
an accident of evolution it is hard to make changes in some
structures  The panda has a thumb plus as many fingers as its
ancestors five on each hand but the thumb is a modified wristbone
rather than a modified finger and extra fingers are much more common
than extra limbs especially fullyfunctional ones

Kangaroos 3limbed I dont think so If you take the view that the
tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are 5limbed I think the
tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case
of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather
than locomotion I dont know much about panda thumbs so Ill ask
is it opposable

Thermodynamic considerations of surfacevolume relationships would
seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range
similar to what we see about us 6 inch tall intelligent aliens
seem unlikely as do those much larger than the elephant

Why cant a lemur or a brontosaurus be intelligent

Yes I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by
putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus but so far
space aliens are also mythical

Well I wont say flat out that they cant be intelligent but Ill
bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I
dont think its likely First let me say that when I say intelligent
I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level
with or greater than human tool use and tool building IE assuming
suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter 
its enviroment in a planned way it will do so Thats certainly not
a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice
for a putative technological alien

Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but
its generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level
of complexity This is generally determined by the number of neuron
cells and their interconnections So a creature the size of a lemur
wouldnt have enough neurons to support complex thought This argument
is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur Theres room
for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed One
reason this may be true is neuronic speed The electrochemical messages 
that trigger neurons require time to propagate This makes it difficult
for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very
large creatures So theres little selection pressure for such brains
Instead a simpler distributed network evolves This doesnt rule out
intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction

Then there are the thermodynamic arguments A tiny creature like the
lemur needs to eat frequently because its internal heat is rapidly
lost due to its high surface to volume ratio I contend that a creature
that must spend most of its time and energy feeding wont have the time
to develop and exercise intelligence That argument may be somewhat weak
The dinosaurs problem is the reverse it must moderate its heat production 
because its high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat 
Im assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical
reactivity reasons for productive neuron function So creatures would
tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that
of humans if they are carbon based That tends to rule out cold blooded
creatures as potential homes of intelligence Some people contend that
some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded But for a creature
the size of a brontosaur its activity levels would have to be restrained
or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the
waste heat Whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the
ocean a much more efficient sink than air I suspect that for intelligence
to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the
environment is necessary IE monkey curiousity I doubt a large dinosaur
would be capable of that much activity
