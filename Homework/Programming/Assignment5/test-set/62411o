I dont think that idea means what you think it does Having everyone
on Earth subject to some ad agencys poor taste is an abomination
abomination  n loathing odious or degrading habit or act an
object of disgust Oxford Concise Dictionary Maybe you dont mind
having every part of your life saturated with commercials but many of
us loathe it

Its a moot point Step out of your door go anywhere except possibly
your mailbox You will be subject to some ad agencys poor taste
 
Id rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred
by a giant billboard and Ill bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious
to an astronomer like Sagan

While Im sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldnt be
because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer Modern 
groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased
telescopes In any case a bright point of light passing through
the field doesnt ruin observations If that were the case the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned
they are extremely bright
