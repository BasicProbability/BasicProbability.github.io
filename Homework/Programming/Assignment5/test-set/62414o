Having tracked scispace for quite a while I have some questions
about a mysterious figure called Henry Spencer If there is anything
going on in the space community he seems to know it 
	The questions are somewhat toungeincheek
	1 Is scispace a hobby or a job for you
	1 Do you ever eat or sleep
	3 Does U of Toronto Zoology department conduct space research 
	Or do you just use an account there
Just curious
