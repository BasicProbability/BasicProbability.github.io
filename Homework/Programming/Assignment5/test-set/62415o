   If this idea goes through its the thin end of the wedge  Soon
   companies will be doing larger and more permanant billboards in the
   sky  I wouldnt want a world a few decades from now when the sky
   looks like Las Vegas  That would really make me sad

   Think for a moment about the technology required to do that  By 
   the time they could make the Earths sky look like Las Vegas 
   the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon Round
   trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as
   5000 kg in a Low Earth advertising orbit Very roughly the
   same cost as a smallish billboard therefore If such ads were
   to become common place that would have to be a very low price

This is nonsense  Its like saying that by the time commercials
on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own
hour long nationally broadcast TV program

   Theres always been a problem of having to get 
   away from civilization before you can really find natural
   scenery 100 years ago this usually didnt take a trip
   of over 5 miles Today most people would have to go 100 miles
   or more If we ever get to the point where we have billboards
   on orbit that essentially means that no place on Earth is still
   wild While that may or may not be a good thing the orbital
   billboards arent the problem They are just a symptom of 
   growing denselypopulated civilization Banning such ads will
   not save your view of the night sky because by the time 
   such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
   finding a place without street lights where you can see
   the stars

The rest of your post is strange mishmash of its already really bad
and it doesnt really matter if it gets worse  You should try to
figure out what you are really arguing for  Kneejerk antienviron
mentalism

light astronomy as an object as bright as the full moon
