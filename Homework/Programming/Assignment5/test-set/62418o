But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
500 years it may very well be Ayn Rand who in every important respect
was American but was born in Russia  But I guess that remains to be seen

1 Please take this out of scispace

2 Ayn Rand was not only born in Russia but educated there A lot
of her philosophy reflects not only a European education but a 
reaction against certian events in Russia while she lived there
Ive heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy
between the Continental and BritishAmerican schools Rand belongs in
the former in terms of methodology et al even though she was trying to
say things that would belong in the latter school

Ie she was trapped in the language of Kant and Hegel even though
she was trying to say at times much different things
