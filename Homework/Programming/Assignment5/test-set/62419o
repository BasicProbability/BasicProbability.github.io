Subject Re STS57 inclination

From article 1993May140232201vax1tcdie by apryanvax1tcdie
          Primary payload Spacehab 1 EURECA 1R   Inclination 57 degrees
 I have seen elsewhere that inclination is 28 degrees 
 Which is correct

Hmmm Atlantis left Eureca in a 28 degree orbit Retrieving it is
going to be REALLY fun if they fly to 57 degrees Torque that 
Canadarm
