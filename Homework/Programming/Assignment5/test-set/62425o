It is however now somewhat of an experimental science with the exploration
of fractals strange attractors and artificial life Whether important
insights will be gained from these experiments is unknown but it does
tend to change the shape of what has mostly been viewed as an abstract
deductive field

How do you do experiments in mathematics

Nowadays usually with a computer No theory predicted the numeric 
discoveries listed above No one can yet write an algorithm that will
predict the precise behavior of any of these at any precise level of
their evolution So it remains for experimenters to gather data on their
behavior
