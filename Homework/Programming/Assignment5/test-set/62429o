I dont think that idea means what you think it does Having everyone
on Earth subject to some ad agencys poor taste is an abomination
abomination  n loathing odious or degrading habit or act an

having every part of your life saturated with commercials but many of
us loathe it

While Im sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldnt be
because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer Modern 
groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed
orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field The
opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased
telescopes In any case a bright point of light passing through
the field doesnt ruin observations If that were the case the
thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets
might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned
they are extremely bright

Tell that to the people who run the 10meter Keck telescope or the 
astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8meter telescope
project  It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building
Keck II  According to the December 1992 Sky  Telescope This
second 10meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
with double the lightgathering power and the ability to resolve
the headlights of a car some 25000 kilometers away   Japans 83meter
Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea  All these telescopes
will work in the infrared yes but they are visible light telescopes

And havent you heard anything about adaptive optics  A lot of research
was done with Star Wars funding and some is now being shared with
astronomers  This shows great promise  Soon probably within a few
years even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
theoretical limit despite the distortions of the atmosphere

To say that visible light astronomy is already a dying field is 
pure hokum  To use the logic that things are already bad so it doesnt
matter if it gets worse is absurd  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields
