Phil your point is well taken  It is still a sad idea

Im worried by the concern about it though for a number of reasons
that have nothing to do with Space Advertising which for a number of
reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds

And Ive been reading and and writing this thread since way
back when it was only on scispace

For starters I dont think the piece of lightpollution apparatus
would be as bright as the full moon That seems to me to be a bit
of propaganda on the part of opponents or wishful thinking on the
part of proponents

Second this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been
levelled against other projects that either 1 dont increace light
pollution significantly or 2 increace light pollution only over the
target area

You may or may not recognize 1 as being Solar Power Sattelites
I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math showing that
SPSs werent that bright after all ending some two months of frenzied
opposition on the part of darksky activists and various other types

2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested
recently  While slightly more worrisome Id like to point out that
any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of
these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be
concerned and something any project like that would work against
anyway And given some of the likely targets I dont think theres
going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants There is too much
dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter and I doubt youll find
many activists in Murmansk demanding the natural sky back If anything
hell probably be inside stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp
making sure hell get enough vitamin D for the day

The mirror experiments arent something theyre doing for crass
advertising They think that if they can build one itll be one of
those things people in the affected areas will think they couldnt
have lived without before And I doubt anyones going to really be
able to convince them to stop
