Were talking about an orbiting ad here not some little point
of light that puts a streak or two on a photograph  It should have been
clear that anything used for advertisement is going to be a bit larger than
a point source  Even if this was not clear theres a previous post on this
topic that makes it clear

In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called Space Marketing
in Atlanta Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
						      
and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising
  

From the description Ive read its prob only going to be
as bright as Jupiter Anything else is probably hype from the
opponents or wishful thinking from the sponsors

If we could do something as bright as the full moon that soon
that cheap the CIS would have done it already
