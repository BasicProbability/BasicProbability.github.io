To say that visible light astronomy is already a dying field is 
pure hokum  To use the logic that things are already bad so it doesnt
matter if it gets worse is absurd  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields

Ok so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
computer algorythims but have you looked ad the Hubble results the
defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software see
those jupiter pictures for results but is the effects are completely
reversable why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it

The way I see it and please astromomers give me a swift netkick in
the butt if im out of the ball park the astromers are making the
best of limited possiblities theres only one hubble and the shuttle
makes another in the near future a nonthought  Perhaps those self
same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind
mounted on the reverse sides of the mirrors if that is what is used
and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope
