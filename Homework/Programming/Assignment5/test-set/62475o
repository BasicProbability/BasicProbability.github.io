Ahh perhaps thats why weve astronomers have just built 2 10meter
groundbased scopes and are studying designs for larger ones

fc Exactly what fraction of current research is done on the big 
fc visable light telescopes From what Ive seen 10 or less 
fc down from amlost 100 25 years ago That sounds like dying
fc to me

 That doesnt seem like a fair comparison  Infrared astronomy 
 didnt really get started until something like 25 yrs ago it
 didnt explode until IRAS in 1983  Gammaray and I think 
 Xray observations didnt really get started until the 70s
 I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
 general and I know that extreme UV short of 1000 Angstroms
 observations until the EUVE launched last year had almost 
 no history except a few observations on Skylab in the 70s

 Twentyfive years ago the vast majority of astronomers only 
 had access to optical or radio instruments  Now with far more
 instruments available growth in some of these new fields has
 resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of 
 total astronomical work


Seriously though youre never going to get a 10meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics
and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway

fc That would be true if adaptive optics worked well in the visable
fc But take a look at the papers on the subject They refer to anything
fc up to 100 microns as visable I dont know about you but most
fc people have trouble seeing beyond 7 microns or so There are
fc reasons to think adaptive optics will not work at shorter 
fc wavelengths without truely radical improvements in technology

 Hmm some of the folks in this department planning on using 
 adaptive optics at the 5 m at Palomar for nearinfrared 
 observations 1 and 2 microns might be surprised to hear this

 And isnt the NTT already pushing toward 01 arcsecond resolution 
 from a groundbased site remember 01 arcseconds was one of the 
 selling points of HST
