 Is it not also an abomination that somebody would spend money on space 
 advertising when those children are starving Perhaps some redistribution
 of wealth would help them 
 
 
 This is specious emotionalism  Commercial enterprises typically dont
 spend money on starving children or other world problems anyway at
 least not in excess of whatever minimum amount is required for lip
 service and PR purposes  Precisely where would you place the threshold
 beyond which advertising spending is deemed abominable and why

Yes  Just take money from the profitable commercial enterprises
and give it to the government to redistribute  Government is so much
more efficient trustworthy and noble than selfserving businesses 

Lets nip this redistributionist ignorance in the bud  If it were not
for commercial enterprises the whole world would be starving
