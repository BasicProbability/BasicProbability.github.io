 A staffer just told me an interesting story about DCX An Air Force
 costing team just looked at the DCX now called the DCX1 BTW and
 gave an estimate on how much it would cost the Air Force to build it
 It cost SDIO 70M to build and it would cost the USAF
 
 
 
         320 million or four and a half times as much

Id be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be
accounted for by the AFs requirement for superfluous 2167 documentation 5
or 6 huge requirements and design reviews travel expenses flying personnel
around to meetings and over specifying the hardware I doubt that the
actual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from
SDIOs costs

Of course this is my cynical opinion based on years of watching the
government procurement process try to cover up a lack of creativity and
innovation with reams of documentation
