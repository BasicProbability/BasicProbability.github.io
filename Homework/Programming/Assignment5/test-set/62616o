Jeffrey L Cook sez
This object would not interfere with anyones enjoyment of the night sky
it would be invisible at night nor would it have any significant
impact on astronomical observations  I suspect there must be some kind
of underlying agenda coming to the surface when in spite of this people
are so quick to shrilly denounce and condemn something that would so
vividly demonstrate the strength of Western capitalism

Lazlo Nibble sez
Buying Lichtenstein and paving it over with ground glass would also
demonstrate the strength of Western capitalism but that doesnt make it
a particularly attractive idea  Is that what this country has been reduced
to  The planetary equivalent of a guy who gets his penis out at parties

Actually paving ground glass over Lichtenstein wouldnt demonstrate the
strength of Western Capitalism since its strength depends on use of
the mind and materials in the fulfillment of needs and desires  Mind you
Im not saying noone would benefit from glassedover land but I dont
think anyone would actually pay for it unlike the potential billsats

I dont quite follow you on the part about someone exposing their genitals
at parties but I got a chuckle from it anyway  And I thought I had some
strange friends
