Subject Re Space Marketing would be wonderfull

 While Im sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldnt be
 because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer Modern 
 groundbased visible light astronomy what these proposed
 orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field The
 opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
 driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or spacebased
 telescopes

Hardly  The Keck telescope in Hawaii has taken its first pictures theyre
nearly as good as Hubble for a tiny fraction of the cost

 In any case a bright point of light passing through
 the field doesnt ruin observations If that were the case the
 thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets
 might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned
 they are extremely bright

I believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still
more like the full moon  The moon upsets deepsky observation all
over the sky and not just looking at it because of scattered light

This is a known problem but of course two weeks out of every four are
OK  What happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes  What
would be a good time then
