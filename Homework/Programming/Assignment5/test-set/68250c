OW 30 is the same  But the definition of broken is relative  Pageview
requires DSC compliant PostScript files in order to stop at page breaks
I dont consider that broken  I say that any program that puts out a
PostScript file that isnt DSC compliant is broken

Well that may be true  However the man page for pageview for OW 20
does not mention about DSC compliance  In any event the point here
is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will
find out that its not a practical tool

It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need
to be DSC compliant  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the
right hand is doing at Sun  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview
program does require DSC compliant PostScript  There was the possibility that
it was going to be changed so that if the file wasnt DSC compliant that it
would stop at each showpage  I believe that this method would preclude being
able to go backwards and forwards through the file ie you could only go
forward to the next showpage  This isnt in OW30 pageview but maybe it is
in the Solaris 2x version of OW OW 31

In any event I find pageview extremely useful  Since all of the PostScript
that I produce IS DSC compliant I dont have any problems
