Ive been getting mail from Xhibition about the June conference and I was
wondering if Microsoft had bought Xhibition  The front says Conference
from Microsoft Windows NT Developers  Whats the deal  I thought
Xhibition was for Xwindows

I had exactly the same feeling  I was depressed  If you ever programmed
Windows and X11 youd be depressed if an X conference touted its tutorials
to show you how to convert from X to Windows API  Sort of like how to
convert your C classes to the new improved C

What happened
