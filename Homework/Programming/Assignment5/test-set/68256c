Subject Graphics Text with X

Are there any graphics texts with examplesdemosprojects directly in
X

The last time I taught the course I used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package with implementations available for
XMacPC  The problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package but frustrated that they
couldnt really use their skill for other work
