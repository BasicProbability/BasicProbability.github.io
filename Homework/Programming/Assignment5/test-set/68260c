   We have a problem with makedepend it doesnt know how to correctly process
   if clause in C preprocessor statements It evaluates everything to
   true no matter what the conditionals are

   

   Has anybody come up with some solutionfix to makdepend other than
   WriteYourOwnParser and willing to share it with us

rewrite makedepend to use cc M or gcc M or gcc MM which is
the one I prefer since system headers dont change that often for
generating the actual dependencies  youll still need to write the
parts that edit the actual Makefile  I think theres a program in the
Berkeley distributions called mkdep that will do essentially this
