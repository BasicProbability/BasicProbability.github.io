Subject Re makedepend problem


 We have a problem with makedepend it doesnt know how to correctly process

Im most of the way through adding a grammar for parsing the if expressions
I dont know when Ill be able to get back to it youre welcome to what I 
have so far I havent looked at other versions of makedepend which may solve
the problem more elegantly
