Subject Problems with characters above 127


Hi all

Ive read the FAQ Ive fiddled around but I am still having problems getting
my poor old HP9000300 to let me inputdisplay characters above 127  I have 
the following in my Xdefaults

XTermFont        adobecourierboldrnormal141407575m90iso88591

So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm  I have NOT
set my LCCTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it it tells me that
that locale is not supported apparently we have no additional locales defined
or at least liblocale doesnt exist  I can get some of the characters
above 127 to print out but they are not where Id expect them  for example
Altv does not produce a u umlaut  This leads me to believe that the fault
lies with the stty settings which are as follows

speed 9600 baud line  0 susp undef dsusp undef
intr  C quit   erase  H kill  K swtch  
eof  D eol   min  4 time  0 stop  S start  Q
parenb parodd cs8 cstopb hupcl cread clocal loblk crts 
ignbrk brkint ignpar parmrk inpck istrip inlcr igncr icrnl iuclc 
ixon ixany ixoff ienqak 
isig icanon iexten xcase echo echoe echok echonl noflsh 
opost olcuc onlcr ocrnl onocr onlret ofill ofdel tostop 

Anyway Ive struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks and any help
anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated


					Thanks
