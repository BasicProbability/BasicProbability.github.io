Subject Windows  Motif tools SUMMARY


	I posted this May 12th


         I am looking for info on products that can take
 Windows source on a Unix box such as Sparc and produce a
 Motif executable  Another requirement is that MFC 20 should
 be supported  I already know of
 
         WindU  by Bristol Technologies
         Hunter SDK
         MainWin by MainSoft
 
         Are there any others
 
 	I will post a summary if its wanted


	I got a few requests asking for a summary so Ill attempt one
here


	Heres the ones I know of

	WindU		 Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	 Hunter Systems

	MainWin		 MainSoft

	LIBWXM           Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name  At the moment it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about  They dont
yet support MDI or MFC  Libwxm was used to port VisSim a mathematical
modeling package  Does native Motif Widgets like WindU from Bristol
Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info  Shes very helpful

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or QuasiMotif look and feel at
runtime  They skip the Xt and Xm Motif X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib  They dont yet support MFC  Theyre at 415 896 0708

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track  WindU uses
XlibXtXm to give a real Motif app  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE Common Dialogs and more on the horizon
My contact there is knowledgeable responds to my email and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles
Theyre at 203 438 6969 or you can email infobristolcom
