Subject Re HPGL to anything converter wanted

 Ive found an hpgl viewer for X and a converter from HPGL
 to postscript Does anybody have anything that allows you
 to convert from anything into HPGL Im desperately in need
 of something like this

HPGL does not support raster primitives so a formatter would have to 
punt on most popular image formats  This probably explains the lack of
translators out there  What do you need to plot
