Due it seems to Suns crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes
most standard GNU and other software wont compile out of the box well tar

Right now Im trying to make ghostview It complains it cant find X11XaW
so I just linked ln s the files from usropenwinshareincludeX11 and 
now the ghoddam thing still complains it cant find them

I still havent been able to compile xdvi not no way

Has anyone ever managed to get anything normal to compile on a Sun
SunOS 413 and OpenWindows 3 Whats the trick Im missing Ive even 
tried hard copying all the relevant files into the right places and
every time theres some bit missing or it refuses to find it

Sounds like you didnt load the support for those libraries when OW30 was
loaded  The Xaw support was missing from OW20 but added in 30
