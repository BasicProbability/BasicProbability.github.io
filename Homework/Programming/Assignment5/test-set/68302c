It seems silly but while Ive located things like tgif that can  edit
gif  files and various tools to convert tofrom gif format I havent
been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a
gif file in it  Ive looked thru various faq files also to no avail
Is there one lurking about in some  archive   Nothing  sophisticated
just show the pretty picture

Alternatively if I could locate the specs for gif I dont suppose it
would be too hard to write it myself but I have no idea where to even
start looking for the spec  Well actually I do have an idea  this
