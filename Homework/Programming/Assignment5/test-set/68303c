 We get this too  If you put Bstatic into your options it goes away 
 Things seem to run ok without itmust not be called very often

From the FAQ

Subject  96 What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4123

        In SunOS 412 Sun fixed a sharedlibrary bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library causing these symbols notably
to be undefined when building some X11 clients
        getwmShellWidgetClass
        getapplicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling Bstatic lXmu Bdynamic appears to work

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 30 X11R4based Xt please
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches

Patch id      Description

                        shared libXmu
