Subject Resources and cpp  HELP

Hi

I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS6000 AIX 32 and X11R5 on a Sun4 SunOS 41

Since I run X on both colour and blackwhite displays I need different
values for the same resource so I want to use ifdef COLOR in my
application defaults files However cpp is only invoked by xrdb and
not when the resources are loaded on demand

Is there a proper solution to this

So far the only proper solution Ive come to think of is to create 2
different files in my appdefaults say XTerm and XTermcolor and
set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either HOMETN or HOMETNcolor
But that does not always seem to work eg executing a remote shell
command without reading the cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH

Furthermore I thought of using include XTerm in XTermcolor
However for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTermcolor
things are different on both machines On a Sun the FIRST found resource
is used ie the one from XTerm the bw one while on an RS6000 the
LAST found value is used ie the one from XTermcolor What can I do
about it

I have one last question for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH I
can use T N C and S T stands for appdefaults N for the
resource class but what do C and S stand for

Thanks in advance for replying
Marcel
