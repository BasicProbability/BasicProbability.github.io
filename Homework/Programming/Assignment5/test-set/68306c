Subject aXeHPUX Problem

Ive been happy with aXe under Linux Now I wanted to use it under HPUX
too However my attempts have ended in core dumps this far Bus Error

Has anybody else been more successful Jim Wights INSTALL file does
say there have been problems with HPs

Data aXe 50 HPUX 901 X11R4 or X11R5 doesnt seem to matter shared
libs HP 9000720

Thanks in advance
