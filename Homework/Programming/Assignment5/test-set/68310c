Im getting lots of files in usrlibX11xdm of the form
	Abert0a00138

Im running xdm  Anybody know what these are and better yet how to
move them ie what resource can I change to make them appear
somewhere else

That are the authorisation files for the server
Depending on what type of key your X supports they contain magic cookies
DES based authentication or SUN DES authentication

The place is defined with the DisplayManagerauthDir 
Other things like the file name can be changed as well see XDM manual pages
