Subject Integration of HP46021AKeyboard into SCO ODT 20

SCO ODT allows to adapt the XServer to any nonstandard AT keyboard 
using the Xkeyboard configuration compiler xsconfig SCO provides some
configuration files in usrlibX11xsconfigkbd eg for 
Siemens WX200

Question
Is there anywhere a configuration file for the HP46021A keyboard
available  
I am especially interested in using the HP specific keys such as 
InsertLine Menu

Thanks  Ron
