 Hi
 
 	
 
    Could someone explain to me what exactly the Xlib functions 
 
 XCreateRegion XPolygonRegion XPointInRegion do or to 
 
 suggest a ftp site where I can find programs using these functions
 
 
 PS The man pages does not explain much 
 
 	
 Thank you

I use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas
heres a small piece of code that uses those routines

static void Redisplaypw ev region
XtpManagerWidget pw
XExposeEvent ev
Region region

 ppexposureregion is an XRegion 
XtpManagerPart pp  pwplotter
ppexposureregion  XCreateRegion
    region is passed via an expose event 
ifregion  NULL

if evsendevent   synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw
        
        exporectx  pwcorex
        exporecty  pwcorey
        exporectwidth  pwcorewidth
        exporectheight  pwcoreheight
        
     else
        
        exporectx  evx
        exporecty  evy
        exporectwidth  evwidth
        exporectheight  evheight
        

stuff deleted      

 region now contains the exposure region 
        XUnionRectWithRegionexporectppexposureregionppexposureregion

else
        XUnionRegion  region ppexposureregion ppexposureregion
stuff deleted 
 WE NEED to CLIP on EXPOSE REGION for REDRAWING the GRID 
        XSetRegionXtDisplayOfObjectpw ppplotareagcppexposureregion
stuff deleted 
         check to see if child is exposed 
        if XRectInRegion pwplotterexposureregion
                         childcorex 
                         childcorey 
                         childcorewidth  
                         childcoreheight 

So I build up a region of exposures so that when I service my container
widget redraw of rectobj children I only redraw what need to be redrawn

It works for me hope this helps you
Brian
