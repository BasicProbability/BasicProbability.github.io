You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine  That is when the
load problems occur  If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterms this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste

Ethernet certainly has enough bandwidth for a few blinking cursors  My
Lisp Machine blinks the cursor twice a second and updates the time in the
status line every second  This uses under 1K bytessecond or about 1 of
the bandwidth of Ethernet  A hundred of them on a single ethernet might be
a problem but a couple dozen should be fine

Granted its nothing to loose sleep over but this is Ethernets tragic flaw
the more activity especially lots of tiny activity the more collisions
happen and the performance gets exponentially worse  I am just now
opposing ANY kind of waste of bandwidth under Ethernet  Although in a polling
system it would not be so bad
