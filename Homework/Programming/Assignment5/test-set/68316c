Subject EventHandlers on XmPushButtons


	Help

	Ive got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across
	the top a toolbar  I wanted to add eventhandlers to these
	pushbuttons on EnterWindowMask and LeaveWindowMask so that
	I can put up some descriptive text about the function of each
	pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it

	Ive done this fine but Ive turned up the following problem

	When the pushbuttons are sensitive I get callbacks on both of
	the above events but when they are not sensitive I only get
	callbacks on LeaveWindow events  This seems odd  I would
	expect this to be an allornothing type of thing

	Is this a bug  If not can someone explain this behavior

	thanks

	Mark
