I am looking for GUI BuildersUIMSs which run in a VMSOpenVMS
environment I am interested in both Motif tools and GUIindependent
tools such as XVT My client also requires that the tool has been
in production for at least 6 months in the VMS environment Note
that I have the list of tools from the FAQ but not the info on
VMS availability

Thanks

Take a look at TeleUSE a complete UIMS from Alsys formerly TeleSoft
In the US you can reach them at 619 457 2700

Alsys have an VMS version of TeleUSE v205 for VMS V55 or higher
built using DECwindows Motif 10 based on X11R4 and Motif v111

BTW the VMS port from the UNIX version was made at my company and was
released in November 1992
