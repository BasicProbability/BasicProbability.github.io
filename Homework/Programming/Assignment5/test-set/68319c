Subject XDM  backgroundPixmap 


Hi

Ive tried to get rid off XDMs ugly Login window by giving it a cool
backgroundPixmap ressource As Login is derived from Core this should be
possible Anyway setting xloginbackgroundPixmapabcxpm did not
produce any message of the form cannot convert String to Pixmap and
explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing too

Any way to do it
