What are HyperHelp and Xprinter  Read on

Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 30 of
its popular HyperHelp product and version 20 of Xprinter

			    HyperHelp 30
			    
HyperHelp is the defacto standard for online context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace  Through a one
line function call application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time  HyperHelp can use the same RTF
project and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows Motif and
Open Look  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker 
And with HyperHelp 30 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler

New features in HyperHelp 30 include secondary windowsa character
based viewer segmented bitmaps SGML support and an improved History
window

			     Xprinter 20
			     
Xprinter 20 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existingnew X based applications
very easily  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
to your application Xprinter is the tool for you  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR42
