Subject cheap hard drives for your PCXT

 
   I have a few the original IBM 10Mb harddisks for sale They are actually
Seagates ST412 MFM full height  has the IBM logo and black face plate 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 60 It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and antistatic bags I am not sure if they were ever 
used but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order 
 
 30 each plus shipping cost about 5 
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs this is for you   Its cheaper
than a floppy drive
