    And if you are Jewish you are a selfhating Jew  There can
    be no doubt of this  

There are doubts about it Why dont you define what selfhating Jew means
I found the idea itself of being a selfhating Jew to be one of those
I hope you can come up with a definition in itself

Try coming up with your own definition of any or all selfhating peoples
To me any who reject their culture to the point where they only see the
absolute negatives of that culture generally or regarding a particular
event and accept only those views purely opposing aspects of that culture 
thus selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring
of context results hate their culture That certainly describes Elias 
since he has no intention of recognizing that alongside the Palestinian
experience and perspective there exists also that of Israelis 

    Who is a Jew  A person whose integrity decays when unmoved 
    by the knowledge of wrong done to other people

That is why I get moved when I see the Israeli Army killing people in 
the Occupied Territories as much as I get moved when I see a Plestinian
stabing people in Israel

And this is precisely why Israeli society has been tremendously harmed
by the actions it its government has felt it had to take in response
to an other perceived as a threat Just as with you there has long 
been a strident and emotional debate about the pain Israelis feel when 
forced to balance desires for survival and moral beliefs The trauma
of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither
can be conveniently brushed aside as a result of a reasoned political
debate for the sake of the other only reshaped
