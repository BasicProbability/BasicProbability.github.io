Josip

please dont be offended at this question Who are the Muslims in the
Bosnian context i know that a moslemmuslim is a believer in Islam
Islam 
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world But it is
not
 yes definitely not an ethinic group ok so these Bosnian Muslims
who
are they to which ethnic group do they belong what languages do they
speak do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or
Croats 
the way the western press use the word muslim in this Bosnian debacle
has 
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslimmoslem i knew from
childhood was 
changed in the dictionary this is just a question no flames intended

Youve asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide 
Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity They speak SerboCroatian But
there is a ChristoSlavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian
and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
the people ie Christian slavs For this reason the warcriminals
call all the Bosnian Muslims Turks even though they are not ethnically
Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language  For this reason
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously other is called paradoxically ethnic
cleansing rather than religious cleansing

You are somewhat close to truth But you shouldnt forget that
nationality is a recent invention of the western europe In the
days of the Ottoman empire the religion was the main point of
difference between social classes The Ottomans didnt recognize
Turks Arabs Greeks Serbs Just christians muslims jews
So for all the interested parties in the Ottoman society the
bosnian muslims were Turks After all there arent many real 
ethnic Turks living even in Turkey today Even in Europe its
the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of
ones culture

Thus while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of
WWII and older agenda the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from
Bosnian is being carried out under the cover of the SerboCroat war

Can you support this
