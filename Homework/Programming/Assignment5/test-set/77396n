  I find it interesting that Mr Major finds the genocide of two
million Muslims in Bosnia acceptable   


Now you are actually claiming that 2000000 Muslims have been killed
in BH


        What if we remove one zeron and make it the genocide of two hundred
        thousands Muslims in Bosnia would that make it any better
        And how about the 2000000 Muslims who were driven and continue to
        be driven out of their homes is that utterly ridiculous claim
        And how about the rapes over 60000 women and the concentration 
        camps The us delegation which visited them reported yesterday
        on CNN that the serbs are giving the muslims detainees 4 biscuits
        and a cup of water a day
        That sure also sounds like an utterly ridiculous claim

Please substantiate this utterly ridiculous claim
