So why not condemn the Mufti for his Nazi leanings and 
 while also condemning the similarly genocidal killing of
innocents Muslim or not in BosnoiaHerzegovina Hatred and bigotry
remain just that no matter who practices them

Indeed Yaqouv just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and
Kahanists right   Or they are exempt from condemnation and allowed
to hate

No fool not at all like hatred of ones sworn enemies enemies who
have said time and again that they mean to kill you and have by mur
dering innocent men women and children shown that they really mean it

The late rabbi never hated anyone merely for having been born into a par
ticular group but he and I hate and wouldwill kill anyone who comes
to kill Jews I recall VERY well Rabbi Kahanes words to the Iraqis at a
demonstration You want peace Here is our hand holding out an open
hand You dont want peace Here is our hand holding out a fist

I know youll answer me indirectly it doesnt bother me a bit
Keep it up

Indirectly The wonder of it is that I bother answering the likes of you
at ALL

Steel whos never pissed off
