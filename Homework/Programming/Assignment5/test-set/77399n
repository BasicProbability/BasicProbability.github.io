Subject nobody knows his name


        I dont mean to sound disrespectful but since the majority
of the contributors and may be even readers of this newsgroup seem
to be muslims christians and jews my question could be of some 
interest to any of them
        Its my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great
respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from JudeaGalilee Why 
they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
to me personally I prefer Woody Allen  his stories are much juicier
 but perhaps its an accident of history
        Anyway it seems that they may be talking about two different
jews According to the New Testament his fathers name was Joseph
while in Quran he appears as Zachariah  
        Whos right and why the name difference Im really curious
