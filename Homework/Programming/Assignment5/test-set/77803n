You both seem to have missed the point that most states in the Middle
East and North Africa seem to have constant border and territorial
disputes not to mention boiling hatred for each other  The removal
of Israel is not going to change this picture

As much as I love Israel I do think its true that the ArabJewish conflict
over Palestine which is now almost 100 years old is the primary cause of
instability in the Middle East

Please explain how the removal of Israel from the eqation is going to
ease the situation in Iran IranIraq Iraq IraqKuwait Syria
Lebanon Libya Algeria Egypt Sudan   Human rights freedom of
press and religion slavery government oppression in authoritarian
societies    how are these going to be solved by removing Israel
from the Middle East
