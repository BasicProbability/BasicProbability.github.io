The Arab Association for Human Rights HRA was 
formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and 
human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian 
citizens

It is a unique association concerned with the civil 
political economic social and cultural rights of the 
Palestinian national minority in Israel Among the issues 
of concern are land confiscation education prison 
conditions unemployment torture and the unequal 
allocation of Israels resources

Today there are around 800000 Palestinian Arabs living 
within the Green line the pre1967 borders of Israel 
constituting 18 of Israels citizens For them it is an 
empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the 
needs of the Jewish population Legally and practically 
Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early 
promises of equality for nonJewish citizens have not 
been fulfilled This is apparent in many areas strongly 
affecting the Palestinian national minority

Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 
1948 The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does 
not receive a fair share of state resources On a dayto
day level Palestinians face discrimination in many 
different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission 
to build a house start a business find a job or educate 
their children
