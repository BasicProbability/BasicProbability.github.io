Discussion on Josephus inserts
 
Thanks  Am I correct then in assuming that that Josephus
did in fact write about Jesus but Christian copists embellished it
 
Jack

That is indeed the present consensus  Contrary to what Dr Fox has
been saying however present consensus is not that the longer
passage in Josephus about Jesus was inserted but only that it was
modified
   There is no question that it was at least modified based on what
Origen saysthat Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah but
I dont think the argument that it appears out of context is a very
good one  I havent looked at the context for a while perhaps somebody
could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the Jesus
passage
