I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day
Furthermore we dont know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending
potentially dangerous and armed suspects  Do you suggest that the police
always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have
been allowed to inspect the officerss badges  Just what should the police do
when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects  How far can they
reasonably go to identiy themselves  What do you suggest they can do which
cant be faked by the competition

So instead you are asking individual citizens to place themselves at risk
by assuming that everyone who claims to be a cop actually is a cop
Around here the police have actually made public service announcements saying
that if you are a lady driving by yourself at night and you see blue lights
flashing behind you Do not pull over until you reach a well lit preferably
occupied place gas station etc

Even if youve got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops thats not an
excuse to murder police

It wouldnt be murder it would be self defense
 
Mob rule isnt any prettier merely because the mob calls itself a government
It aint charity if you are using someone elses money
