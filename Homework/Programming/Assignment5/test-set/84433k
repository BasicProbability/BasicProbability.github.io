Subject Re Burden of Proof

In Math exam I have burden of proof when it says
  Prove that no elements in set A n divided by 30 leaves 5 as a remainder
   n prime n integer does exist

Well Mathematics is formal science  Real world may be different thing
But if entertainment company sell computer programs saying they are virus 
safe Doesnt they have burden of proof that viruses dont exist in their 
floppies 

I dont think so  The assumption is there  If it turns out that
their software has a virus then it is up to you to prove that fact
to a court to get any damages  You are theoretically suppossed to 
be able to get damages for that but you have to give some evidence
that the virus came from that software  But since the computer
company is the defendent they are uninvolved until proven guilty
