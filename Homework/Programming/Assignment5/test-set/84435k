It seems you lived a fairly wild life my background is far more
traditional mostly working working working Maybe theres a clear
indication that the way you lived your life produced a certain 
amount of anxiety that needed to be released Religion was one
possible medicine While my more stable environment didnt and 
still does not produce the situation where I feel such guilt

This is just one possible explanation why you feel this burden
while I havent felt it so far
