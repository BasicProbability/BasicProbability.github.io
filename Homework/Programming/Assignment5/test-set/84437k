For those who think David Koresh didnt have a solid structure
or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
I dont think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon  

Other than it tells quite a lot about the Man himself 
                                             
Im curious  Are you referring to Koresh as the Man  Why the 
upper case M                           
                                                         

Its the deaths hes responsible for that concern most people

Are you the spokesman for most people
                                                          
I never claimed to be a spokesman for most people  It is an assumption
on my part that people with normal values and morality would be more 
concerned with human life than sermon structure  
                                      

You missed the point  which is that the Prophets the Psalms and 
Revelation all together provide a very rich view of a very special
event  a wedding                        
                        
                     
Are burning children part of this very special event      
                                          

	                        
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord are
human and imperfect Whatever we preach no matter how eloquent or
how corrupted  is of little difference Those who know the Masters
voice will recognize Him  a gemstone amidst rock Such is also the 
lesson of the stumblingblock For those who have an ear to hear 	
                                                
What about those who do not know the Masters voice  Does the Master
not care about them  Eloquent but corrupt preaching may be of little
difference to you  But I suspect it made a big difference to all of
those who died in the compound
