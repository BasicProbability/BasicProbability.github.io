    Either way I have evidence to support the theory that the BDs burned
 themselves  You made a serious implication that the FBI was responsible
 for the fire and the destruction of the people  All you have done is
 put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
 up your claim that the FBI was responsible

Last night CNN reported that FBI has infrared pictures showing
that the fires started in three places at the same time That 
would indicate something not resembling an accident
