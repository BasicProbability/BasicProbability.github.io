 Eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting
 God  If you choose to jump off a cliff you can hardly blame God for you 
 going splat at the bottom  He knows that if you choose to jump that 
 you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice  In fact
 He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what
 lies below  To prove that point Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being
 God was able to rise up again  I have seen the example of Christ and have 
 chosen not to jump and Im trying to tell you not to jump or else youll 
 go splat
  
 You dont have to listen to me and I wont stop you if you decide to jump
 I only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge  You owe it to
 yourself  I dont like seeing anyone go splat

Im for the moment interested in this notion of the leap of faith
established by Kierkegaard It clearly points out a possible solution
to transcendental values What I dont understand is that it also
clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any
transcendental direction is equal 

In other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above
but at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go
Actually I will do it just now

Cheers
Kent
