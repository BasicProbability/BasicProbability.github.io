Because of course that possibility existed  Meaning any student who
really gave a shit could have a moment of silence on hisher own which
makes more sense than forcing those who DONT want to participate to
have to take part  What other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence

A moment of silence doesnt mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise its not silent now is it

The whole point is maybe everyone doesnt want to participate

And maybe they do  But without somebody to set the time that doesnt
do them any good



Humph  Deleted there was my list of nonreligious reasons one might
want a moment of silence for a dead classmate

Maybe everyone doesnt want to be silent for teachers to give their
pompous nonreligious speeches in assembly  I know I didnt  So

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it that is
supported by taxpayer money is the only way to keep christianity from
becoming the official US religion

Please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
actively religious eg actual prayer Amen after a moment of
silence mandatory classes in religion and not things that have
possible but uncertain religious implications eg moments of
silence having the Bible on the shelves during reading period is not
a way to prevent a state religion
