Capser before you deceive everone into thinking that the latterday
saints have undergone undue persecution through the years for just
believing in their religion perhaps you would like to tell us all what
happened in the Mountain Meadow Massacres and all the killings that were
done under the Blood Atonement Doctrine at the command of Brigham Young

I recently watched a an episode of The Old West a TV show on the 
Discovery Channel or perhaps the AE Network the one hosted by Kenny
Rogers  This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah
etc

A large portion of the broadcast was about the Mountain Meadows Massacre
The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing
about the incident until long after it had happened before telegraph and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn
settlers into what amounted to a mob  All participants in the incident were
prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church

I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode they play them over and over 
and see what they nonMormons have to say about it
