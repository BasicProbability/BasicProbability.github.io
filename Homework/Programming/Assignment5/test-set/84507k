 For those who think David Koresh didnt have a solid structure
 or sound Biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast
 
 I dont think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
 sermon  Its the deaths hes responsible for that concern most people
 

And I think we ought to hold Christ accoountable for all of his followers 
who died at the hand of the Romans also It was their own fault for believing

God this society reminds me more of the Roman Empire every day I guess
Ill just log off and go watch American Gladiators
