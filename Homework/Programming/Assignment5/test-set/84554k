 But if entertainment company sell computer programs saying they are virus 
 safe Doesnt they have burden of proof that viruses dont exist in their 
 floppies 

 I dont think so  The assumption is there  If it turns out that
 their software has a virus then it is up to you to prove that fact
 to a court to get any damages  You are theoretically suppossed to 
 be able to get damages for that but you have to give some evidence
 that the virus came from that software  But since the computer
 company is the defendent they are uninvolved until proven guilty

All right Im not and wont be lawyer What about doctors
I going to fly aeroplane or drive car Doctors have to look for different
kind of illnesses in me before I get permission to fly an aeroplane
They have burden of proof that harmful illnesses dont exist in me
do they 

Im just questioning my belief that believers have the burden of proof
