    BDs were not contemplating suecide and there is no reason 
    to believe they committed one

No reason  How about these two

1  Some of the survivors claimed that BD members poured fuel along the
	corridors and set fire to it  The speed at which the fire spread
	is not inconsistent with this claim

	This morning on CNN tues April 27 Texas Cops say Arson is suspected
	because of two falsh points CNN also stated that  all surviors
	claim the fires are FBI set  Your argument are madeup untrue
	and unverified at best

2  There was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound
	There is a very very good possibility that the FBI did not start this
	fire  This is a good reason to believe that the BDs did

    The day of the attack the FBI claimed to have seen two BDers setting
    the fire outside of the compound Yesterday the arson squad said two 
    flash points at the or near the tank entry points

    Not good evidence for the FBI hit squad

3  Even if the BDs were not contemplating suicide it is very possible that
	David Koresh was convinced and thus convinced the others that this
	was not suicide  It was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort

  is there a difference between thinking that you wont survive a confrontation
  with the FBI parnoia and committing suicide


There are three possibilities other than the BDs self destruction


B  The fire was started by an FBI accident  This is possible but it would be
	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it
	Sure its possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
	which started the fire why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
	the day near the edge of the complex  Its anecdotal evidence that
	has been contradicted by other escapees

	No claimed by the escapees  not contradicted

	What Im finding interesting is the conflicting reports FBI says
	that bodies have been found with bullet wounds and the Texas Cornuers
	sp says that they havent yet found any bullet holes
