Subject Re Tieing Abortion to Health Reform  Is Clinton Nuts

In article 1993Apr2616362711364csrduiucedu gskinneruiucedu writes
I find myself unable to put these two statements together in a
sensible way

Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the pregnancy



If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth then
your statement would make sense  But that is not the case so it doesnt

Are we paying for the birth or not Mr Parker  If so why cant the
mother afford the pregnancy  If not what is the meaning of the
latter objection  You cant have it both ways

Birth  pregnancy  If they were the same the topic of abortion would 
hardly arise would it Mr Skinner
