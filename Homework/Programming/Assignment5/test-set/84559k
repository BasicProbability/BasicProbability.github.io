Because of course that possibility existed  Meaning any student who
really gave a shit could have a moment of silence on hisher own which
makes more sense than forcing those who DONT want to participate to
have to take part  What other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence
 
A moment of silence doesnt mean much unless everyone
participates  Otherwise its not silent now is it
 
The whole point is maybe everyone doesnt want to participate
 

Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic
 
Blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it that is
supported by taxpayer money is the only way to keep christianity from
becoming the official US religion
 
Not noticing that danger is utterly idiotic
Please provide evidence that having a moment of silence for a student
who died tragically costs taxpayers money
