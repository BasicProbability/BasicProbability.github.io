 bad thoughts these

  well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of
cult and say all faiths are cults or if you take a more socialcontext
view of cult which allows you to recognize mainstream religions as 
sociallyacceptable and cults as groups that involve techniques of brain
washing and all the other characteristics that define oppressive probly not
the best word cult behaviour

Yeah but implicitly the socialcontext view provides a justification
for the dictionary definition of a cult those who follow the mainstream
pretend while those in cults act based on the very same impulses  Now
who is to be taken seriously  

  im confused  could you restate what yer saying in those who follow
the mainstream pretend and act based on the very same impulses
