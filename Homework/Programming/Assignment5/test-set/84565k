  Probably not  But then I dont pack heavy weaponry with intent to use it
  Please cite your evidence that he was intending to use it
 Well he would be pretty stupid not to I mean whats the use of spending
 thousands of  on something you wont use sorry if Im stepping on the toes
 of any members of some rifleassociation here Rifles bought for
 hunting I can understand rifles bought for killing people or for just
 keeping I cannot
 Just for the record I am myself a collector of medieval armour  weaponry
 and I dont just have it hanging around I use it obviously only in
 fencing practice with friends

Well let me see if I can explain it  Its similar to collecting coins
or stamps or campaign buttons or coke bottles or juke boxes or model
trains or just about anything else that is collected and just about
everything is collected  In all cases you might consider it something
of an aberration I mean what purpose does it serve  Not much really
its just a hobby  The collector yearns for diversity not much use in
having TWO of the same thing except for tradingselling it historical
significance this was the thingy used by soandso technical significance
this is the only one that does suchandsuch like this this is the first
one to do it this way rarity and so on

Some people use their collections other people do not  As you state you
use your collection  In one sense this diminishes the value of your
collection as the items suffer wear and exposure  In another sense it
can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection  Some people collect
firearms that they do not use other people use some or all of the firearms
they collect  Its just personal preference

Oops personal preference  I guess were not supposed to have that any
more are we
