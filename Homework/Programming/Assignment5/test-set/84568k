If you would like to understand better the sort of behavior
that we saw in connection with the Waco tragedy Id strongly
recommend reading When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger
Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter available as a Harper
Torchbook It goes a long way towards explaining how a 
belief system can be so strong as to withstand even overwhelming
disconfirmatory evidence At least read the first chapter
Interestingly just as the Branch Davidians had roots in the
SeventhDay Adventist movement the SDAs themselves had their
roots in the Millerite movement of the first half of the 19th
centurya movement that expected the end of the world in 1843
was disappointed when it did not take place and wound up as
a church

Thats also how Christianity came to be The immediate return of Jesus
was expected when it didnt happen they formed their own church
