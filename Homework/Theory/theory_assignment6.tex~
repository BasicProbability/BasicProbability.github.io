\maketitle

\paragraph{Cooperation}
Cooperation among students for both theory and programming exercises
is strongly encouraged.  However, after this discussion phase, every student writes down and submits his/her own individual solution.

\paragraph{Guidelines}
You may pick {\bf N exercises from exercise type I}, as well as {\bf M from exercise type II} for submission, i.e. you need to submit {\bf a total of N+M exercises} to be able to get all points. Numbered exercises with an exclamation mark are supposed to be a bit harder and you may challenge yourself by trying to solve them.

In the directory of your private url there is folder called `theory\_submissions'. Please upload your submission there. Your submission should be a PDF-document (use a scanner for handwritten documents!) entitled \textit{AssignmentX\_yourStudentNumber.pdf}, where \textit{X} is the number of the assignment and \textit{yourStudentNumber} is your student number. If your submission does not comply with this format, we will deduct 1 point. For each day that your submission is late, we deduct 2 points. N.B.: If multiple files are submitted for a single assignment before the deadline, the latest version will be graded.

If you have any question about the homework or if you need help, do not hesitate to contact \href{mailto:T.S.Brochhagen@uva.nl}{Thomas}.

\paragraph{Exercises}

\paragraph{Type I [N exercises: Q point per exercise]}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let RV X encode the results of (i) a flip of a fair coin, (ii) a toss of a fair 4-sided die, and (iii) a toss of a fair six-sided die. Compute $H(X)$ for (i), (ii), and (iii).
	\item A biased coin comes up heads with a probability of $\frac{2}{3}$. Compute the entropy of the outcome of six coin flips.
	\item Let $X$ encode the sum of the roll of two fair dice. Compute $H(X)$.
	\
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Type II [M exercises: R points per exercise]}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Show that $D(X\parallel Y) \neq  D(Y \parallel X)$ for $X \neq Y$.
	\item Show that $D(X\parallel Y) \geq 0$.
\end{enumerate}
