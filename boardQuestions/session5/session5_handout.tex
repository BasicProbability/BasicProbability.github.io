\section{Sufficient Statistics}
You are given a data set $ x=x_{1}^{n} $ of $ n $ i.i.d. geometrically distributed observations.
Show that $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} $ is a sufficient statistic for the geometric distribution.

\section{MLE}
A coin is taken from a box containing three coins, which give heads
with probability $ p = \nicefrac{1}{3} , \nicefrac{1}{2} $, and $ \nicefrac{2}{3}$. The mystery coin is 
tossed 80 times, resulting in 49 heads and 31 tails.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item What is the likelihood of this data for each type on coin? Which
coin gives the maximum likelihood?
\item Now suppose that we have a single coin with unknown probability
p of landing heads. Find the likelihood and log likelihood functions
given the same data. What is the maximum likelihood estimate for p?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bayes' Rule for Parameters}
A coin is taken from a box containing three coins, which give heads
with probability $ p = \nicefrac{1}{3} , \nicefrac{1}{2} $, and $ \nicefrac{2}{3}$. The mystery coin is 
tossed 80 times, resulting in 49 heads and 31 tails.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item What is the likelihood of this data for each type on coin? Which
coin gives the maximum likelihood?
\item Now suppose that we have a single coin with unknown probability
p of landing heads. Find the likelihood and log likelihood functions
given the same data. What is the maximum likelihood estimate for p?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Geometric MLE}
For an i.i.d. data set $ x = x_{1}^{n} $ find the MLE for the geometric distribution:
$$ P(X=x) = (1-\theta)^{x}\theta $$
